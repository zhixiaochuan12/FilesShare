手术的代价是把"锡拉"安全找回来

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,590
看看买家有没有留消息

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,660
是迈阿密的区号

东西

我确信你们明白
i'm sure you understand no one can know

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,190
不能让人知道"锡拉"的去向
where scylla's going.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,930
你知道是谁拿走了吗
do you know who took it?

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,130
不  但赛尔夫和格雷琴知道
no, but self and gretchen do.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,060
那你就有队友了
then you've got your team.

12
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,290
我不会和他们一起工作
i'm not working for them.

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,890
你简历中的空白
there are holes in your resume

14
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,090
格雷琴或赛尔夫  甚至巴格维尔都能填补
that gretchen or self or even bagwell can fill.

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,630

00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,560
他逃走了

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,290

我的辞呈

无论你有什么计划把我们从这弄出去
whatever plan you're working on to get us out of here,

20
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,430
我们最好有所行动

迈克尔  你不能离开这里
you're not getting out of here, michael.

22

我做了个交易
i made a deal.

23
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,030
用"锡拉"换回你的命
your life in exchange for scylla.

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,330
就凭你对"公司"的了解
you think you can do that

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,860
你以为你能做到吗
knowing what you know about the company?

26
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,290
你想知道我对"公司"的了解吗
you want to know what i know about the company?

27
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,100
妈妈生前一直为他们卖命
mom worked for them before she died.

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,460
我会竭尽所能结束这一切

迈阿密  偷走"锡拉"的人在这
miami. the guy who took scylla's here.

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,130
你真的要帮"公司"找回"锡拉"吗
so you're-you're actually trying to get it back for the company?

34
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,690
只有这样  我们才能
i'm gonna give it back to the company so we can

35
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,530
摆脱这一切
walk away from this.

迈克尔的事连一个字都没提

我不信任的人

51
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,590
好吧

52
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,160

林肯  我知道你为什么要这么做

我很感激你  因为迈克尔当时命悬一线
i'm grateful to you, because he was gonna die.

55
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,590
但是  你真的认为
but do you really think that

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,190
他们拿到"锡拉"后  会放过我们吗
they're just gonna let us live when we give them scylla?

57
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,930
莎拉  我尽力而为吧

林肯  "公司"的信息部

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,060
终于找到那个人的电话了

62
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,530
追查到一个地址
it's a number, and it goes to this address--

63
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,890
格拉夫顿  是个酒吧
the grafton; it's a club.

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,930
他打了几个电话

三个  都是打出去的
three. all outgoing.

66
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,690
我们如何得知
how do we know this guy's

67
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,730
他还在迈阿密
still in miami,

68
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,190
而且没有把"锡拉"卖出去
that he hasn't sold it already, huh?

69
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,690
我不是抱怨什么
not that i'm complaining.

70
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,060
我在这个州可有过不少"历史"
i've had some filthy, filthy times in this state.

71
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,190
千万别搞砸了
don't screw this up, all right?

72
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,100
这可是我们唯一的线索
because that's our only lead on this guy.

73
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,260
你应该感谢我当时没杀你
be thankful i haven't killed you.

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,130
是吗  你以为你是埃利奥特・奈斯吗[联邦神探]
oh, yeah? wh-what are you, eliot ness now? huh?

75
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,490
因为我骗了你们  你还在生气吗
what, are you upset because i screwed you over, linc?

76
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,860
别装得好像
'cause don't act like

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,530
你从来没对别人做过同样的事
you haven't done that to ten times as many people.

78
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,760
我们都一样  林肯
all right? we're just crooks that got caught, lincoln.

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
这个
this...

80
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,130
这小子  他去是没用的
this guy, this isn't gonna work.

81
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,460
我们还是关注"锡拉"在谁手里吧
why don't we all just focus on who's got scylla.

82
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,060
你觉得呢
what do you say?

83
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,490
斯科菲尔德
hey, scofield.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,390

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,360
我到底在哪
i said, where am i?

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,630
树林里的一座房子
it's a house, in the woods,

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,360
位于某处60英里外
60 miles from anywhere.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,960
没有武器
swept clean of weapons, so you don't need

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
所以你不用白费心机了
to worry your head about that.

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,190
窗户和门上都没有栏杆
there are no bars on the windows or the doors,

92
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,590
但附近区域有三种美洲狮出没
but there are three types of mountain lion in the area,

93
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,260
所以你最好呆在这里
so you might want to stay close by.

94
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,490
我来说吧
i'll take it from here.

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,530
我是罗杰・诺顿医生  迈克尔

让我和你谈谈

雪茄是用来抽的

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,530
说完了吧

103

你的行动都是建立在
you've been operating under some...

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,860
对"公司"的错误看法上的
misconceptions about the company,

如果你的事实指的是"锡拉"内的信息
if by facts, you mean what's on scylla

110
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,060
以及  我妈妈曾为"公司"工作过
and that my mother once worked for the company,

137
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,090
我不知道怎么说才好
i don't know how better to say this.

138
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,400
她离开你和你哥哥  是为了保护你们
she left you and your brother to protect you.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,290
以免受到太阳能合成工作的威胁吗
from the dangers of solar synthesis work?

140
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,290
我知道"锡拉"内的东西
i know what's on scylla.

141
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,530
有一定威胁  你和林肯可能会被绑架
there were threats, you and lincoln might be kidnapped.

142
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,330
你们当时很危险
you were in imminent danger.

143
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,790
真的吗

我哥哥被捆在电椅上的时候
where was she when my brother was strapped

145
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,160
她在哪
to an electric chair?

146
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,590
她一直在马达加斯加的雨林里工作
she'd been working in a madagascar rain forest,

147
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,090
没有卫星信号
without satellite access.

148
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,930
或者她已经过世25年了
or she wasn't alive, hasn't been for 25 years,

149
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,290
这些都是你编的
and this is all fiction.

150
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,160
因为你妈妈的研究  科尔多瓦外的荒地
there's a million acres, corn and soy, outside cordoba

151
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,190
现在变成了绿油油的田地
that was arid scrub before your mother's research.

152
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,930
那不是我编的
that's not fiction,

153
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,430
那些食物
that's food...

154
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,130
可以养活成千
for thousands.

155
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,260
上万的人
millions.

156
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,500
"锡拉"上还有很多
there's so much more

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,690
你不知道的事情
on scylla than you know.

158
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,990
听起来  我们还有很多要谈
it sounds like we'd have a lot to talk about.

159
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,830
为什么不直接给她打电话
why don't you get her on the phone.

160
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,260
等你准备好
when you're ready.

161
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,290
现在就行
no time like the present.

162
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,830
当你准备好
when you're ready...

163
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,230
加入她
to join her.

164
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,360
加入我们
us.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
这是我这次谈话的
that's... what this conversation

166
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,330
重点
is about.

167
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,160
加入
joining...

168
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,300
"公司"
the company.

169
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,100
喂  埃里卡  是我
hey, erica, it's me.

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,430
你来了吗
so, are you coming?

171
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,360
我需要和你谈谈
i really need to talk to you.

172
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,160
她在路上了
she's on her way.

173
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,860
我的天啊
oh, my god!

174
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,530
为什么他要打酒吧的电话  而不打给埃里卡呢
why'd this guy call the club's phone and not erica's?

175
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,860
我...他们经常吵架
i... they fight a lot,

176
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,190
她不接电话  他就打酒吧的电话
so when she doesn't answer, he calls the club.

177
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,490
你找他干什么
what do you want with this guy?

178
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,630
他拿了我的东西
he took something that belongs to me.

179
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,060
我要拿回来
i want it back.

180
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,030
在那
there.

181
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,060
埃里卡在那
there's erica.

182
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,560
在这等着
wait here.

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,430
把他搞定
get him stitched up.

184
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,360
大个子
big guy.

185
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,460
光头  疯子
shaved head. crazy.

186
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,560
-他到底是谁  -我不知道
- who the hell is he? - i don't know.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,760
他相信 你是那个女人的朋友
he bought the whole thing about you being friends

188
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,230
的话了
with this chick or whatever?

189
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,100
他不知道我才是你女朋友
he didn't know i was with you,

190
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,130
当他知道时  他只想躲别人的子弹
and by the time he did, he was trying not to get shot.

191
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
你做得很好
you did good.

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,930
我只想抽支烟
i just need a smoke so bad.

193
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,330
完了
oh, no.

194
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,000
怎么了
what?

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,930
我的钱包
my wallet.

196
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,430
这是那个陷害我的小妞的
this is the chick who set me up.

197
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,730
我们找到她  就能找到那个人
we find her, we find our guy.

198
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,600
在酒吧打架  公共场所开枪
busting up clubs, firing shots in public.

199
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,730
你再这么干下去  我们就别想在这呆了
you keep that up and we're not going to last here much longer.

200
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,860
我可没打算在这久留  你想吗
i don't plan on staying here very long. you?

201
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,730
瞧  这就是我为什么佩服将军
see, that's why i have to give it up to the general.

202
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,900
他把四个敌人放在一起  保准起内讧
he puts four enemies together, guaranteed dissension.

203
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,930
但不会有同谋造反
no alliances form against him.

204
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,130
这是那家伙女友的地址
this is our guy's girlfriend's address.

205
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,130
他估计跑路了
he's probably gone,

206
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,730
看看能找到什么
but see what you can find.

207
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,960
这就是蒂亚
this is tia.

208
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,960
你想知道我对他们的谈话的想法吗
do you want to know what i think they were talking about?

209
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,600
我不管
i don't care.

210
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,100
只要他们不挡我的道
just as long as they keep out of my way.

211
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,800
你也一样
same with you.

212
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,230
让她进来
send her in.

213
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,830
莎拉  你看来
sarah! you're looking...

214
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,730
精神不错
rested.

215
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,290
那宾馆怎么样
how is the hotel?

216
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,260
我想在迈克尔康复期间
i would like to offer my professional

217
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,290
提供我的专业协助
assistance in michael's rehabilitation.

218
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,230
很好
kind...

219
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,290
但他接受的是最优秀的照顾
but he's receiving excellent care.

220
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,800
你没必要担心
there's nothing for you to worry about.

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,630
不管你为他准备了什么
whatever it is you have planned for him,

222
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,800
我只想帮忙维持他的健康
i would simply like to help maintain his health.

223
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,660
很感激你  但是不行
and that's appreciated, but it's impossible.

224
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,960
相信我  现在最好
believe me, you serve michael best

225
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,260
跟迈克尔保持一定距离
at a distance right now.

226
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,530
相信我
trust me.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,030
我只想看看他是否安好
i have no agenda apart from simply...

228
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,860
别无所求
wanting to see that he's okay.

229
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,330
三天或一星期后
and in three days to a week,

230
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,130
他就会回到你爱的怀抱
he'll be back in your loving arms forever.

231
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,930
好的  我没这个耐心
okay, i'm not that patient.

232
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,100
放任一下自己吧
indulge yourself.

233
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,460
坐在泳池边
sit by the pool,

234
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,390
想象一下将来
envision the future:

235
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,760
财政安全
financial security,

236
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,500
迈克尔的才干能在世界范围内应用
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale,

237
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,830
你能在旁看他创新
you beside him innovating.

238
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,360
迈克尔的才干能在世界范围内应用
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale?

239
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,460
我只是想最大化他的潜力
i'm simply trying to maximize his potential.

240
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,160
你的也是
yours, too.

241
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,900
你对他做了什么
what's being done to him?

242
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,860
我要结束这种猫捉老鼠的游戏
i'm putting an end to this exhausting cat-and-mouse.

243
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,000
谢谢你专程来访
thank you for stopping by.

244
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,530
激进建筑学一直被
"radical architecture is a rejection of all formal

245
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,960
传统方式所反对
and moral parameters."

246
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,530
出自你的论文
from your thesis.

247
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,000
严重扭曲了某人的话
someone else's words heavily paraphrased.

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,430
并且这只适用于建筑和结构
and it pertains to buildings, structures.

249
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,160
我认为你是用于隐喻
i think you meant it as a metaphor.

250
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,860
结果印证方式吗
what, that the ends justify the means?

251
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,100
这跟你母亲的理论
which neatly

252
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,460
惊人的一致
coincides with your mother's philosophy.

253
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,760
你知不知道  30年前
did you know that she had an almost identical quote

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,660
她在论文里
in her thesis?

255
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,700
引述过几乎同样一句话
from 30 years ago.

256
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,960
你倒是做了不少功课啊
you've done a lot of homework.

257
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,130
只是找些话题
just a few conversations.

258
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,430
我猜你们在"公司"的圣诞派对上
let me guess. you two had some kind of moment

259
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,200
有过一段美妙时光吧
at the company Christmas party?

260
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,700
我认识你母亲很久了
I’ve known your mother for years.

261
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,100
了解到你和她一样聪明绝顶
well enough to know you've got the same brilliant mind

262
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,760
很有幽默感
and the same sense of humor, for that matter.

263
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,130
这和幽默没关系吧
I’m guessing this isn't about my sense of humor.

264
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,360
她最初
she was just

265
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,530
也不愿加入"公司"
as resistant to joining the company,

266
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,330
但当她了解了事实
but then she learned the truth.

267
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,360
如果你指"公司"是为了拯救世界
if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world,

268
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,730
我不相信
I don't buy it.

269
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,960
如果我母亲在"公司"如此才华出众
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company,

270
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,800
你想让我干吗
what do you want with me?

271
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,060
一个全球性功能全面的
a fully functioning scylla project would exist

272
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
"锡拉"工程
on a global scale.

273
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,100
单凭一个人是做不到的
it can't be managed by one person.

274
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,230
但两个
but two...

275
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,430
心有灵犀的天才
equally formidable, working in lockstep?

276
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,630
绝对没问题
absolutely.

277
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,530
想法很好
that's very good.

278
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:49,360
你什么都想到了
you've clearly thought of everything.

279
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,560
迈克尔
michael...

280
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,660
如果我在骗你
if i weren't telling you the truth,

281
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,190
我又怎么能拿到这个东西
how would i have gotten this?

282
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,660
她只是个和罪犯交往的傻妞
this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal.

283
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,730
完全是浪费时间
this is a waste of time.

284
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,000
布伦斯的领导风范
a signature of burrows' leadership.

285
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,260
我们要调整一下
all right, we need to make a shift.

286
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,660
巴格维尔  我现在告诉你
bagwell, i'm telling you right now,

287
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,700
如果你在我行动时手软
if i make my play and you go soft,

288
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,330
我就把你扔下阳台
i will sail you off that loft balcony

289
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,760
鬼都不会关心
and no one will bat an eye.

290
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,500
我的目标很明确  唐
my aim is true, don.

291
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
相信我
keep it in your pants.

292
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,330
我相信你  行了吧
i'll keep it in my pants, all right?

293
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,830
更改体制的回报  说声"是"
all right, all in favor of changing the regime, say "aye."

294
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,260
是  长官
aye, aye, captain.

295
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,800
好的  那布伦斯就滚蛋了
aye. all right, burrows is out.

296
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,360
很好  发过来
good, great. send it.

297
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,960
"公司"在传蒂亚的信用卡记录
the company's e-mailing tia's credit card history.

298
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,860
我越来越觉得这是内部工作
you know, i'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job.

299
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,530
-为什么  -有几个理由
-why?  -a couple reasons.

300
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,230
他带到见面地点的设备
the hardware he brought to the meet.

301
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,860
能当场读出"锡拉"的内容
he could read scylla right on the spot.

302
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,930
自从他消失后
since he's disappeared,

303
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,130
我应该能找到他  但却不行
i should be able to find this man, and i can't.

304
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,030
通常找不到的人  就是"公司"的
people you can't find are usually company.

305
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,560
那又怎么样
how does that change anything?

306
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
不怎样
it doesn't.

307
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,630
只是一切更难了
it just makes everything harder.

308
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,000
林肯
lincoln...

309
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,560
我们什么时候才能开始
when are we going to get this out of the way?

310
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,060
什么
what?

311
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,130
我一生诱惑了那么多男人
of all the mercenary humps i've thrown at guys

312
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,800
我也该得到我心仪的那个
in my lifetime, i think i'm due for one i want.

313
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,030
别自作多情了
don't flatter yourself.

314
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,600
太晚了
too late.

315
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,630
说出来吧
name it.

316
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,600
任何事都可以
and i do mean anything.

317
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,460
屁都没找到
an ol' fat load of nothin'!

318
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,160
什么都没有
a big ol' goose egg.

319
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,100
啥都没有  旧通讯录  旧照片
nothing. old address books, photographs,

320
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,430
电脑上的硬盘
hard drive from her computer.

321
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,930
我查了她的邮件和网站
i checked her e-mails and her web sites.

322
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,330
没有任何我们想要的信息
there's nothing from our guy.

323
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,360
你确定查这女的有用吗
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here?

324
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,100
因为我开始觉得  我们在做无用功
because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip.

325
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,500
"公司"要多久才能把
how long is it gonna take the company

326
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,900
里面的东西读出来
to pull everything off this thing?

327
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,160
几小时吧
a couple hours.

328
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,530
行了  林肯  不如这样
all right, linc, this is the deal.

329
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,030
我们很感激你的努力
look, we appreciate your effort,

330
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,360
但我和巴格维尔做了次表决
but bagwell and i took a vote,

331
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,430
我们在福州行动  但你的能力不够
and this being florida and all, you came up a little bit short.

332
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,600
什么意思
meaning?

333
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,930
你不是一把手
you're not in charge.

334
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,700
那谁是
who is?

335
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,290
-他  -没错
him. yeah.

336
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,630
莽夫行事的方式
the bull-in-the-china-shop routine

337
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,130
可能在你偷东西时管用
might have worked when you were stealing gumballs,

338
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,900
但我们现在都虎落平阳
but our asses are on the line now, okay?

339
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,330
而且都和将军达成协议
and we all have deals with the general.

340
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,360
所以只能这样
so that's the way it's gonna be.

341
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,830
况且  连格雷琴都没有帮你说话
and if you notice, even gretchen hasn't leapt to your defense.

342
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,130
林肯  就让他当头吧
linc, just let him wear his crown.

343
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,230
如果他没想过把东西卖了就行
i would if i thought he wasn't gonna sell this thing.

344
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,330
只是我一个人这么想过吗
oh, what, am i the only one who's thought about that?

345
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,430
林肯  听着
look, here's the deal, linc.

346
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,860
到时候  会让你当当头
at some point, you'll have a vote.

347
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,290
但是在那之前  你没戏了
but until then, you're done, all right?

348
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,360
我们不听你的了
we're shuttin' you down, okay?

349
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,230
你不是头头了
you're no longer in charge.

350
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,160
看来又得重新投票了
uh-oh, looks like there's been a recount.

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,430
来的不是时候
bad time?

352
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,660
不  正是时候
no, perfect.

353
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,100
你再不听从我的指挥
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do,

354
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,830
我就毙了你
i'm gonna blow your brains out.

355
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,870
把她找回来
bring her back.

356
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,330
这次不一样
it's not gonna be the same.

357
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,130
想起什么了吗
stir any memories?

358
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,800
我当时十岁  我们去杰克逊洞野营
i was ten. we were on a camping trip in jackson hole.

359
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,270
钓鱼  远足
fishing, hiking.

360
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,830
一家人围坐在篝火旁
family huddled under a blanket in front of the bonfire.

361
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,030
你可以停了
you can stop now.

362
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,300
为什么  因为两年后这一切都消失了
why? because two years later it was gone?

363
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,630
相片中的四个人
you know, three of the four

364
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,370
有三个都还活着
people in this photograph are still alive.

365
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,960
你想说什么
so what are you suggesting,

366
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,730
让我拿起鱼竿
grab my fishing pole?

367
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,900
为全家在怀俄明州重聚准备吗
time for a...a family reunion in wyoming?

368
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,030
你想去哪都行
or wherever you like.

369
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,870
别告诉我  你不希望实现这个
don't tell me it's something you haven't wished for.

370
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,170
我所希望的  都是不现实的东西
i wished for a lot of unrealistic things.

371
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,430
我也已经忘了
i got over them, too.

372
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,870
为什么
why,

373
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,470
我们可以让它变成现实
when we can make this happen?

374
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,470
这些照片随时随地都可以拍
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time.

375
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,770
在你进监狱前
before you were incarcerated,

376
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,830
每周年祭  你都会去她墓碑前看她
you'd go to visit her grave on the anniversary

377
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,130
够了  别说了
all right, enough.

378
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,870
你会带一束蓝色鸢尾
you'd bring a bouquet of blue irises.

379
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,900
在那里坐一小时
you'd sit for an hour.

380
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,130
别说了
i said stop it.

381
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,230
离开时  会拿一朵
when you'd leave, you'd take a flower

382
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,700
别在翻领上
and pin it to your lapel.

383
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,130
她每年都看你这么做
she watched you do this every year.

384
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,400
她看到了你所背负的痛苦
she's seen the pain you carry.

385
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,430
她想弥补
she wants to make amends.

386
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,300
够了
all right!

387
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,030
你是做了不少功课  真有你的
so you did a little digging. good for you.

388
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,000
但你说的都是谎言
but everything out of your mouth is a lie,

389
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,500
我一个字都不相信
and i don't believe a word of it.

390
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,730
你省省吧
so let's just stop.

391
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,470
别再说了
let's just stop.

392
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,100
这是蒂亚的住址
that's tia's address

393
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,670
查看一下
right there. pull it up.

394
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,130
她住在这  工作地点在这  但是昨天
all right, she lives here, works here, but yesterday

395
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,870
中午时分  她在蓝鸟酒吧
she used her credit card to buy a drink

396
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,100
用信用卡买了点酒
at the pelican club a little after noon,

397
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,930
1点左右  去礼品店
and then she picked up something at the gift shop

398
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,230
买了些东西
a little after 1:00.

399
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,130
等他男友下船
waiting for her boyfriend to debark.

400
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,860
是上岸
disembark.

401
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,630
-那他已经在城里了  -对
he's already in town. yeah.

402
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,100
那他应该住在港口
then he lives in the marina.

403
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,630
这也可能是另一个内部工作的原因
or this is another reason to think it's an inside job.

404
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,470
如果他和"公司"的人工作
if he's working with someone from the company,

405
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,900
他们不会希望名字出现在航空乘客名单上
they wouldn't want their names on any flight manifests.

406
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,330
没错  他们想暗中
all right, they're trying to get scylla

407
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,730
将"锡拉"用船运出境
out of the country by boat undetected.

408
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,730
我们走
let's go.

409
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,330
阿历克斯
alex, yeah?

410
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,430
谢谢你能来
thanks for coming when you did, man.

411
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,930
你信守诺言帮过我  我欠你的
you helped me like you said you would. i owe you.

412
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,700
由我来谈
okay, i'll do the talking.

413
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,100
你们在这里等
you guys wait here.

414
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,470
阿历克斯  我们走

能帮你们什么吗
what can i do you for?

418
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,830
认得她吗
recognize her?

419
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,700
她叫蒂亚・海顿
her name's tia hayden.

420
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,000
不认识
can't say i do. wish i did.

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,470
长得倒挺漂亮
nice little tomato there.

422
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,370
她昨天和一个男人来过
she was in here yesterday with a man.

423
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,800
帮不了你们
can't help.

424
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,370
抱歉

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,730
我是唐・赛尔夫  国安局的

427
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,470
没什么关系
no relation.

428
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,330
我们正和外资调控部门合作
our department is working with the office

429
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,030
听说过吗
of foreign assets control. have you heard of them?

430
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,400
听过
yep.

431
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,830
相信你也听过  我们在调查
I bet you have. we're looking into smuggling

432
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,670
古巴雪茄走私案
and contraband transportation of cuban cigars.

433
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,960
我发誓  这里没有
none here, swear to god.

434
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,830
行了  那得我们说了算
all right, well, that's for us to decide.

435
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,330
大概要一周
it's going to take about a week,

436
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,430
在此期间你要关门大吉
and it's going to involve shutting down this entire marina...

437
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,330
没错
oh, yeah.

438
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,400
一个星期

439
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,700
-或者  -她来过
or... she was here

440
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,060
和你们说的那个人一起
with that guy you were talking about.

441
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,770
他想知道私人船只停在哪
he wanted to know which berth a private charter was docking in.

442
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,000
他要我把船停远一点  我照办了
he asked me to move it further down the dock, which i did.

443
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,870
避开海岸巡逻队
further away from the coast guard slip?

444
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,500
我没问  我也没收钱
i didn't ask. and i didn't accept any money.

445
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,100
如果他说付过款  那是骗人的
if he said he paid me, he's lying.

446
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,730
出发点呢

我们要快速进行一次行李检查

455
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,900
不会占用很多时间

只请各位配合
your cooperation is all that's required.

457
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,470
打开你的包

458
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,930
跪下
get on your knees!

459

3卷大麻

我还在服缓刑
i'm on probation.

463
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,200
我会被抓回监狱吗
is this going to send me back?

464
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,030
给自己做个头盔  老弟
make yourself a helmet, pal.

465
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,730
就像小时候那样
just like old times.

466
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,200
把她找回来
bring her back.

467
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,170
你知道我做不到
you know i can't do that.

468
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,600
我的能力有限
but, look, there's some stuff that i can do.

469
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,770
这次不一样
it's not going to be the same,

470
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,130
但我们会弄明白的
but we're going to figure it out.

471
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,700
无论如何
and, no matter what,

472
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,270
我们都会在一起
it's still going to be me and you.

473
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,470
我很高兴你在山上过得开心
i am thrilled that you're enjoying your trip to the mountains,

474
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,960
但这可不是度假
but it's not an open-ended vacation.

475
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,570
斯科菲尔德现在身心疲惫  精神沮丧
scofield's exhausted. despondent.

476
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,300
很抗拒  但也是个典型弃儿
he's very resistant, but a classic abandoned child.

477
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
他会屈服的
he'll come around.

478
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,800
需要多久  医生
time frame, doctor?

479
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,000
不用药的话  3天
unaided, three days.

480
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,500
如果用喷妥撒呢
with the pentothal?

481
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,730
会快些  但这相当于药物叶切断术
sooner, but it's nearly a chemical lobotomy.

482
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,960
如果他能自愿归顺  那将是他的决心
but, if he turns on his own, it'll be his decision,

483
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,370
他的思维
his reasoning.

484
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,430
他就能永远归顺我们
we'll own him forever.

485
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,500
斯科菲尔德很狡猾
scofield's squirrelly.

486
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,000
不经过历练  我是不会相信他的
i won't trust him till he walks hot coals.

487
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,600
我相信能让他转变
i think i can get him there.

488
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
很好  但如果
good. but, if

489
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,060
我发现你被他耍了  医生
i find out he's been playing you, doctor,

490
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,470
你也会接受跟他一样的叶切断术
you'll get the same lobotomy as scofield.

491
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,760
尽快搞定
just get it done.

492
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,060
快走
Let's go.

493
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,760
快上车
In the van.

494
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,760
开车
Go.

495
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,820
如果解开手铐后  你有什么举动
if you fight when those cuffs are off,

496
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,390
警卫们不会手下留情
the guards will stomp the life out of you.

497
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,050
知道了
yeah.

498
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,120
抱歉  行动粗鲁了些
forgive the dramatics.

499
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,220
不能让"公司"知道我们见面
the company can't know i'm talking to you.

500
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,590
你就是"公司"的人  你是他女儿
you are the company. you're his daughter.

501
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,060
你还想不想找到迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
do you want to find michael scofield?

502
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,150
当然想
of course i do.

503
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,790
他就在60英里外
it's 60 miles northeast

504
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,960
市区的东北边  最好快点行动
of downtown. i'd move quickly.

505
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,290
他们对他做了什么
what are they doing to him?

506
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,820
请他喝柠檬汁
having lemonade.

507
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,290
他们想改造他的思想
they're carving out his personality.

508
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,320
这就是他们招募的方式
that's how they recruit.

509
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,820
你这是在设计我
or you're setting me up.

510
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,220
秘密战虽不光彩
clandestine warfare isn't pretty,

511
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,590
但交战规则
but the rules of engagement

512
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,350
不包括折磨和杀戮无辜者
don't include killing and torturing the innocent.

513
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,020
至少我不会
at least not for me.

514
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,520
迈克尔正在进行快速洗脑
michael is the object of a quick and nasty

515
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,760
而你在浪费时间
process, and you're wasting time.

516
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
走吧
out.

517
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,220
快
out.

518
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,350
我们要安全摄像头的录像
we need the footage from that security camera.

519
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,920
无意冒犯二位  但我
not to offend either of you, but i took

520
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,460
打电话找了律师
the liberty of calling my attorney

521
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,320
询问你们的权利范围
to find out exactly what the scope of your authority is here,

522
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,260
-他告诉我  -只管交出来  行吧
- and he tells me... - just get the tape, all right?

523
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,260
好
Sure

524
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,660
或者我们漏掉了"锡拉"
either we missed scylla...

525
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,890
不可能漏掉
no, no, no. we did not miss scylla.

526
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,920
我们翻了每一个包
we searched every bag.

527
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,390
也许买家已经在船上了
then maybe the buyer was already on the boat,

528
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,320
也要上岸  是吧
and was disembarking, right?

529
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,560
如果他们不想在航空乘客名单上留下名字
i mean, if they don't want their names on any flight manifest,

530
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,290
他们也许会偷溜上去
maybe they just eased back on in.

531
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,490
那也不是最糟的
that wouldn't be the worst news.

532
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,820
意味着他们在迈阿密
that means they're in miami.

533
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,070
好
Right.

534
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,810
戴上你那不光彩的徽章  到船上去
So get yourself back down with your disgraced badge to steamboat willie,

535
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,820
让他把船上每个人的名字都供出来
And have him cough up every name of every person on that boat coming off.

536
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,900
行啊  很好
Okay, that's good,

537
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,100
他们可能从巴哈马坐低等船
Because they probably would have traveled in on a

538
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,720
而且用真名过来  对吗
Low-grade charter from the bahamas, and used their real names, right?

539
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
计划真不错
That would be a good plan.

540
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,690
他还好吗
How is he?

541
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,960
他还活着
He's alive.

542
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,060
我们拿到"锡拉"后
So we get scylla.

543
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,020
我们就自由了  潘姆  还有LJ
Then we're free, all of us-- pam, lj...

544
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,660
突然之间  "公司"有良心了吗
All of a sudden, the company grew a heart?

545
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,920
他们也对我们厌烦了
They're just tired of us.

546
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,990
他们只想要回"锡拉"
They want scylla back. that's it.

547
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,690
我们从来没有他们真正想要的东西
Then we never really had anything they wanted.

548
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,820
没错  我们现在有筹码了
Exactly. now we got leverage.

549
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,290
现在还没有
We don't have it yet.

550
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,890
有发现吗
Anything?

551
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,220
没有
No.

552
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,760
还没有
Nothing yet.

553
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,820
没有
Nothing.

554
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,660
林肯  你不明白
No, lincoln, you don't understand.

555
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,320
她说招募的方式  让我很担心
The way she said "recruit" made my stomach turn.

556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,350
他们会折磨他的
They're going to torture him.

557
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,320
我们拿到"锡拉"前  他至少能照顾自己一天
He can take care of himself, at least for one day, until we get scylla.

558
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,790
林肯  他得待在加护病房
Lincoln, he needs to be in the icu.

559
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,960
你有什么计划
What's your plan?

560
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,720
劫他出来吗
Break him out?

561
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,390
我不知道  我没有计划
I don't know. I don't have one.

562
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,660
那你只是给他和我们带来危险
Well, you're putting him and us at risk.

563
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,890
我们回洛城之前  你就待在宾馆里
Just stay in the hotel until we get back to l.a.

564
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,820
好吗
All right?

565
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,720
唐克雷蒂找到她的白马王子了
Tancredi got the location of her shining knight.

566
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,350
她现在可能去找他了
She may be heading there now.

567
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,090
做得好  巴格维尔
Exemplary, bagwell.

568
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,330
谢谢夸奖  先生
Thank you, sir.

569
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:52,290
说话要算话  不是想唠叨  我只是想
A deal's a deal, right? not to be a broken record, but all I ask...

570
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,350
将军  我认为我们这里有实质性进展
But I think we're making some real progress, general.

571
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,070
斯布家族对"公司"而言  虽是一笔财富
The scofield/burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the

572
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,860
但他的人执意捣乱  我们就要采取行动
Company, but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters, we move on.

573
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,720
将军  我们能搞定一个女人
General, we can handle a lone female.

574
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,160
没错  是只有一个
If, indeed, that's what we're dealing with.

575
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,020
但根据我的经验  一个人会引来很多人
But it's my experience, that with the one comes many.

576
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,560
现在就动手  医生
Do it now, doctor.

577
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,520
还要一小时  他刚吃饭  我不想让他吐
I need an hour. he just ate. I don't want him to aspirate.

578
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,990
马上  医生
Now, doctor.

579
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,690
我要斯科菲尔德能顺利转移
I want scofield pliable for transit.

580
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,990
你的车20分钟后到
Your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes.

581
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,990
万一我们不能使他苏醒呢
And if we can't revive him?

582
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,260
那就认命
C'est la vie!

583
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,220
迈克尔  出来  我们谈谈
Michael, come out. we need to talk.

584
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,880
给自己做个头盔  老弟
make yourself a helmet, pal.

585
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
没错
That's it!

586
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,710
就是他
That's our guy!

587
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,880
蒂亚就在他旁边
There's tia right beside him.

588
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,440
我们把图像导出来  交给"公司"
We've got to pull that image, get it to the company,

589
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,280
让他们找出他
And have them match it.

590
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,080
格雷琴去哪了
Where's gretchen?

591
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,580
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

592
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,500
能发现你的照片
Once I found your mug shot,

593
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,750
再找你的手机号就不难了
It really wasn't that hard getting your legit cell number.

594
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,250
我现在来了
well, now i'm here.

595
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,680
你想怎样
what do you want?

596
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,810
你在洛城一直不要求支援
you never bothered to ask back in los angeles

597
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,010
一心只想杀了我
you were too busy planning on killing me

598
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,810
但事实上  我为"公司"工作
but i actually worked for the company.

599
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,680
我知道你是谁
i know who you are.

600
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,350
我再问一次
and i'll ask it again.

601
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,480
你想怎样
what do you want?

602
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,050
解决你的问题  斯科特
to solve your problems, scott.

603
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:30,150
这是我今天的头等大事
i mean, it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning.

604
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,280
你有大麻烦
you have a big problem, and so does

605
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,050
你的老板也一样
whoever it is you're working for.

606
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,310
你肯定知道
and you obviously know that

607
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,050
要不就不会来见我了
or you wouldn't have graced me with your presence.

608
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,050
你可以搞定吗
and you can make that problem disappear?

609
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,680
又快又彻底
quickly and completely.

610
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,640
但要额外好处
with an extra added bonus.

611
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,210
或者说  大有好处
crucial, i might add.

612
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,610
然后我会编个故事
i then feed the company a story

613
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,850
让"公司"的人到别处找你
that has them looking elsewhere.

614
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,610
也就说你很有价值
meaning you're invaluable
