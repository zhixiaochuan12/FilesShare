86
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,120

估计是防冻液
We think it's antifreeze.

99
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,460

有没有办法能让我们用些非法药物救他
Is there any way we can get some medical help off the books?

105
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,760
不行  不行  这种情况下
No, no, no, no, no, this isn't the kind of thing

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,250
用非法药物肯定不成
that you want to do off the books.

107
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,160
听好  林肯  他需要输血
Listen, Lincoln, he's gonna need a transfusion.

108

迈克尔是B型阴性血型
Michael's B negative, okay?

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,010
可能只有百分之一的人是那种血型
It's maybe one percent of the population with that blood type.

110
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,540
你们去的地方找不到这种血型
You won't find it where you're going,

111
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,810
你找的时候他也撑不住的
and he won't make it while you look.

112
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,270
除非给你送上门
Unless it comes to you.

113

125
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,430
等等  等一下
Wait, hold on a second,

126
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,560

he really is alive?

127
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,850
他刚刚联系过你吗
He contacted you just now?

128
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,820
是的  他需要帮助
Yeah, and, uh, and he needs help,

129
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,060
我认为我是唯一一个能帮他的人
and I think I'm the only one that can help him.

130
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,250
我坐飞机能比他们坐船先到
Yeah, I can get there faster on a plane than they can on a boat.

131
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,120
等等  莎拉
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sara?

132
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,970
你... 你并不亏欠他什么
Y-You don't owe him that.

133
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,180
连你自己都不知道会陷入什么麻烦中  这不安全
Y-You don't know what you'd be walking into; it's not safe.

134
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,760
我会没事的  我别无选择
I'll be fine. I don't have a choice.

135
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,640
我... 这真是糟糕的一周
I...this has been a hell of a week.

136
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,200
好吧  我知道你有大把大把的疑问
Okay, look, I know you've got a million questions,

137
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,830
我也一样  好吗
just like I do, okay?

138
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,470
我不能直视着我儿子的眼睛
I can't look my son in the eye

139
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,510
告诉他我本来可以尽力救他父亲
and tell him that I let his father die

140
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,240
但我却让他死了
when I could've tried to save him;

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,640
他还从没见过他父亲呢  我做不到
A father he's never met. I can't do that.

142
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,460
如果我跟你说别去呢
And if I told you not to go?

143
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,230
"如果"可不是随便说的
"If" is a big word in that sentence.

144
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,340
雅各布  你是在要求我别去吗

好的
Okay.

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,700
本该让她置身事外的  林肯
Should've left her out of this, Linc.

149
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,970
闭嘴  你就要见到你七年未见的老婆了
Shut up. You're about to see the wife you haven't seen in seven years.

150
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,790
-我来  我来  -起航吧
- I got you, I got you. - Cast off.

151
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,290
你们准备好了
You're ready.

What do you mean?

153
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,000
被关久了  久到我都记不清了
Been locked up for longer than I can remember.

154
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,450
奥杰吉亚之前  是我的公寓  脑袋和电话
Before Ogygia, it was my apartment, my head and my phone.

155
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,000
我周围都是高墙
Walls all around me.

156
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,030
看不到这个世界
Couldn't see the world.

157
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,910

中情局昨天并没有批准你们前往国安局

I caught him lying, but he-he--

312
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,880
老天  他掩饰得太好了
oh, God, he covered it so well.

313
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,840
他表现得很真诚还受了伤  我就相信了他
He was... honest and hurt, and I bought it.

314
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,400
他是谁
Who is he?

315
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,590
到底是谁
Really?

316
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,970
他是中情局特工  深度卧底
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.

317
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,950
他管理着一个叫做"21号空间"的地下组织
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.

318
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,770
这和你有什么关系
What does this have to do with you?

319
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,790
他看中了我的能力
He targeted me for my skills,

320
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,620
要挟我
blackmailed me.

321
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,670
他说  如果我不同意为他效力
He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him,

322
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,420
他就不会放过你和林肯
he'd go after you and Linc,

323
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,870
把你俩都送进监狱
put you both in jail.

324
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,180
然后他用行动向我证明了他所言非虚
And then he proved it to me.

325
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,940
他说会让我再也见不到你俩
He said I could never see either one of you again.

326
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,050
或是麦克
Or Mike.

327
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,550
逼着我伪造了我的死亡
Made me fake my death.

328
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,960
然后他就利用我
And then he just used me.

329
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,800
他娶了我
He married me.

330
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,550
如果我早知道他就是你老公  我发誓...
If I'd known he was your husband, I swear...

331
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,170
不  不  不  这不怪你
No, no, no, no, no, this is not on you.

332
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,600
我...
I...

333
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,670
为什么现在  你为什么现在回来
Why now? Why did you come back now?

334
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
那个纸鹤...
The origami...

335
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,810
四年前  他背叛了我
Four years ago, he betrayed me

336
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,520
现在我知道为什么了
and now I know why.

337
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,220
他想让我消失
He wanted me out of the way...

338
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,450
这样他就能拥有你了
so he could have you.

339
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,630
他怎么背叛你的
How did he betray you?

340
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,230
他安排了一个会面
He set a meeting.

341
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,700
我们本该讨论我的下一个任务
We were supposed to discuss my next assignment.

342
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,690
他没告诉我的是
What he didn't tell me 

343
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,940
我们要见的是中情局的副局长
was that we were meeting a man named Harlan Gaines,

344
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,020
哈伦・盖恩斯
a deputy director of the CIA.

345
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,520
当时盖恩斯正在调查"21号空间"
Gaines was investigating 21-Void.

346
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,550
想查出幕后主使的那个叛徒是谁
Looking for the traitor behind it.

347
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,660
那时我才知道我的任务并非是由中情局批准的
That's when I knew my work wasn't sanctioned by the CIA.

348
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,820
波塞冬为了阻止调查
Poseidon shot and killed Gaines that night,

349
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,610
当晚就射杀了盖恩斯
to stop the investigation.

350
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,070
他让我去搬尸体
He told me to move the body,

351
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,460
掩盖所有痕迹
make it look like it never happened.

352
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,870
我看了那一部分的照片  证据确凿
I've seen the photos of that part, they're damning.

353
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,910
他选了我搬运盖恩斯尸体的照片
He chose images that showed me moving Gaines' body,

354
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,690
删除了会给他自己定罪的那些照片
eliminated the ones that incriminated himself.

355
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,630
那时我知道我被下套了
I knew I was being set up.

356
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,130
他想加强对我的控制
He was tightening his control over me,

357
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,190
但我却无能为力
but there was nothing I could do.

358
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,880
至少他是这么想的
At least, that's what he thought.

359
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,650
当我知道波塞冬已经变节
When I knew Poseidon had gone rogue

360
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,920
以及背着中情局私自开展行动时
and was operating outside the CIA,

361
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,610
我就开始谋划回到你身边的事了
that's when I started my plan to get back to you.

362
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,150
你并没有啊
You're not.

363
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,670
另一个人盗用了你的...
Some other man has your--

364
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,840
你的脸  你的过去  你的整个人生
your face, your past, your whole life.

365
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,510
莎拉  我有个计划来纠正这一切
Sara, there is a plan to make this right,

366
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,840
来保护我们的家庭
to protect our family.

367
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,590
迈克尔  他现在正和我们的儿子在一起
Michael, he's with our son right now.

368
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,650
他和麦克在一起
He's with Mike.

369
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,390
我... 听着  我得走了
I, uh, look, I have to go.

370
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,810
"诺亚"  你要给我们造艘船吗
Hey, Noah, you gonna build us a boat?

371
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,610
不  我会做件更赞的事
Nope. I'm gonna do one better.

372
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,370
你给谁打电话呢
Who you calling?

373
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,520
一个有船的朋友
A friend who actually has a boat.

374
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,630
喂
Hello?

375
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,890
-苏克雷  是我  -林肯吗
- Sucre, it's me. - Linc? 

376
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,210
我还以为你会死在中东了呢  老兄
I thought the Middle East was gonna swallow you up, man.

377
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,780
迈克尔在哪  你找到他了吗
Where's Michael? Did you find him?

378
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,030
听着  这就是我为什么打电话
Listen, that's why I'm calling.

379
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,420
我们在克里特岛上
We're on the Island of Crete.

380
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,810
我们需要低调地坐船回美国
We need a low profile ride back to the States.

381
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,950
我是很想帮忙
I would love to help,

382
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,080
但我们现在在世界的另一端  兄弟
but we're on the other side of the world, brother.

383
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,930
我们刚在摩洛哥卸了货
We just dropped a load in Morocco.

384
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,480
你在说些什么啊  摩洛哥离克里特岛很近
What are you talking about? Morocco's near Crete.

385
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,110
是啊  我知道  当然是了
Yeah, I know, of course it is,

386
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,490
其实我的意思是这艘船不是我的
but what I mean is it's not my ship.

387
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,280
好吧  那么搭个顺风船要多少钱
Yeah, but what would it cost to hitch a ride?

388
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,640
你们不能随便搭顺风船
You can't hitch a ride.

389
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,250
你们必须租下整艘船
You have to rent the whole ship.

390
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,040
老板说五万美元一次  林肯
The boss charges 50K a leg, Linc.

391
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,340
你们想回美国  那就需要五万
You want to get back to the States, it's 50K.

392
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,670
五万吗
50k?

393
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,560
我们只是想回家
We're just trying to get home.

394
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,890
你知道我们没那么多现金
You know we don't have that kind of cash.

395
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,090
现在有了
You do now.

396
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,870
拿去  这个是我祖母的
Here, this was my grandmother's.

397
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,670
这件传家宝至少值那么多钱
It's an heirloom worth at least that.

398
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,410
我也想不出它还能派更好的用场了
I can't think of a better use for it.

399
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

400
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,610
我们有钱了  苏克雷  来克里特岛吧
We got it, Sucre. Get to Crete.

401
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,980
他不会伤害麦克的
He's not gonna hurt Mike,

402
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,660
除非他怀疑你知道他的真实身份了
not unless he suspects you know who he really is.

403
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,260
如果你戳穿他的伪装  他才会下狠手
If you remove his mask, he'll lash out.

404
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,230
你比我更了解他
You know him better than I do.

405
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,730
这正是关键  没人真正了解他
That's the point, no one knows him.

406
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,200
所以我该怎么做
So, what do I do?

407
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,690
你就陪他"演戏"  伪装好你自己
You play his game. You wear your own mask.

408
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,300
一旦你有机会带着麦克逃离
As soon as you get a chance to get away with Mike,

409
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,970
抓住时机  赶紧跑
you take it, disappear.

410
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,390
我会尽快赶到美国
I'll get to the States as soon as I can.

411
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,740
我会找到你们
I'll find you.

412
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,290
你看起来好多了
You're looking better.

413
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,990
头发变白了  但是好多了
A little grayer, but better.

414
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,220
我可有一位随叫随到的好医生啊
I have an amazing doctor on call.

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,010
我会伪装自己  我会陪他演下去
I will wear the mask. I will play his game...

416
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,850
如果他伤害我们的儿子  我会杀了他
and if he hurts our son I'll kill him.

417
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,450
我不能...
I can't...

418
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,230
一定要回到我们身边
Please come back to us.

419
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,560
她准备一个人离开克里特岛
She's leaving Crete alone,

420
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,810
就是说她丢下了乌提斯  而他会跟着她
which means she left Outis behind, and he'll try to follow,

421
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,570
过一两天就会回到美国
return to the U.S. in the next day or two.

422
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,570
只可能是坐船或飞机
It can only be by ship or plane, 

423
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,300
所以把他的照片发往所有海空频道
so plaster his face on all maritime and air channels,

424
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,350
重点检查未来48小时内从克里特岛离开的
focusing on all vessels departing from Crete

425
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,720
所有飞机船只
in the next 48 hours.

426
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,250
他肯定在其中之一上
He's got to be on one.

427
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,460
-不能让他回到美国  -雅各布
- He can't make it back inside the country. - Jacob?

428
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,590
是妈妈的电话吗
Was that Mommy?

429
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,100
是的  妈妈在回家的路上
Yes. Mommy's on her way home.

430
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,940
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

431
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,200
我的好兄弟  你的命真是比谁都多啊
My man, you got more lives than anyone.

432
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,300
还以为自己可能把命都用光了呢
Think I might've used them all up.

433
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,990
真是只不死鸟啊
A damn phoenix.

434
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,880
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

435
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,080
我想听你说
I want to hear every damn thing

436
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,790
在你诈死后发生的所有事
that's happened to you since you died.

437
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,670
兄弟  你还活着啊
Papi, you're alive?

438
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,180
那个船长是个见钱眼开的杂种
The skipper is a corrupt bastard.

439
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,230
别惹他  他货舱内有枪
Don't mess with him. He's got guns in the hold,

440
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,840
还有各种违禁品
all kinds of contraband.

441
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,220
船长
Captain.

442
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,160
这就是我跟你说的"货"
Here's the cargo I was telling you about.

443
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,970
付钱
Pay up.

444
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,160
五万在哪
Where's the 50K?

445
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,230
这里
Here.

446
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,160
我说了要现金
I said cash.

447
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,530
这是颗蓝宝石  六克拉  完美无瑕 
It's a sapphire, six carats, flawless,

448
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,830
周围是一圈2.5克拉的镶钻
surrounded by 2.5 carats of bezeled diamonds.

449
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,500
黑市价是十二万五千
Street value is 125K.

450
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,270
你可以按半价当了它  还能赚到钱
You can pawn it for half that and still make a profit.

451
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,280
如果这是假的  我就把你们扔到海里喂鱼
If it's fake, you go under the sea.

452
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,770
我最没想到的是会在船上找到你  老兄
A boat is the last place I expected to find you, buddy.

453
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,120
我原以为你讨厌水
I thought you hated the water.

454
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,460
没错  你还记得啊  但我有案底
Yeah, you remember, but I got a record.

455
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,060
很少有雇主愿意给我这个机会
Not a lot of employers lined up to take a chance on me.

456
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,030
再说  这艘船为我的副业提供了便利
Besides, this ship provides opportunities for my side business...

457
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,330
这才是我待在这艘船上的真正原因

这艘宝贝船里

装了我这辈子的积蓄

460
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,470
我跟你们说  这会是一大笔钱
I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge.

461
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,200
我再过几个月就能彻底摆脱这种生活了
I'm a few months away from putting all this behind me.

462
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,370
要是你们走运  我会让你们
If you guys are lucky, I'll let you guys

463
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,270
带上我的一个"妞儿"爽一发
take one of my ladies for a spin.

464
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,230
什么  就是性爱娃娃吗

465
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,590
不是  要有点品味啊  兄弟

准确地说是可充气  高品质

高价位  高逼真度的性爱娃娃

468
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,990
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

你好啊

470
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,110
麦克呢

睡了

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,110
孩子今天累坏了

473
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,800
但最重要的是
Most important, though,

474
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,160
迈克尔怎么样了
how's Michael?

475
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,480
你帮到他了吗
Were you able to help him?

476
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,820
我到的时候  他已经奄奄一息了
I mean, he was barely alive when I got there.

477
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,260
他... 基本处于睡眠状态
He, uh, slept most of the time.

478
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,510
我为他尽力了  我...
I-I did what I could for him. I, uh...

479
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,370
让他的病情稳定了  但他变了
I stabilized him, but he's changed.

480
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,060
他... 不再是我认识的那个迈克尔了
He, uh... he's just not the guy I knew.

481
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,840
所以  他们送我到了机场  就这样了
‭So, they dropped me at the airport and that was that.

482
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,490
他们是谁
They?

483
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,510
林肯和另外一个人

484

麦克呢
Where's Mike?

486
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,150
-你说他都睡了  -他是睡了
- You said that he was asleep. - ‭He is...

487
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,020
在朋友家  他去朋友家过夜了

488
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,600
好吧  哪个朋友

他在帕特里克家

491
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,880
我真是太笨了
I'm such an idiot.

492
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,950
去的路上怕弄丢所以摘下来了
I took it off on the way over for safekeeping,

493
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,810
我怕被偷了
'cause I didn't want it to get stolen,

494
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,460
结果在回来路上再找时  发现不见了
then when I looked for it on the way back it was gone.

495
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,640
当时我大声尖叫  差点被人赶下飞机了
Screamed so loud they nearly threw me off the flight.

496
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:48,960
{\an8}注意  此人极度危险
系ISIL恐怖分子
曾杀害一名中情局高级官员
并制造多起爆炸案

497
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,780
喂

498
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,330
五角大楼的人来了消息

501
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,700
在地中海一艘货船上

502
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,680
是船长报告的
It was reported by the ship's captain.

503
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,450
海军打算怎么做
What's the navy gonna do about it?

504

最近的濒海战斗舰正驶向目标准备进攻

信息我们已经发出去了

现在就等海豹突击队完成任务了

511
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,620

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,700
你这一遭真是受了不少罪啊  哥们
You've been through hell, my friend.

513

你怎么样  林肯
What about you, Linc?

516
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,080
我觉得林肯有个秘密女友
I think Linc's got a secret girlfriend,

517
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,920
那位女飞行员
the pilot lady.

518
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,460
她不是我女朋友
She's not my lady.

519
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,940
不如让苏克雷给你搞下性爱娃娃
Maybe Sucre will set you up with one of his sex dolls.

520
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,400
她们不是娃娃  伙计
They're not dolls, man.

521
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,900
抱歉  充气娃娃
Sorry, inflatables.

522
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,610
我们换个话题吧
Look, let's just change the subject, please.

523
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,210
不如谈谈安顿下来的事
You know, might be something to be said for settling down.

524
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,920
好吧  没这张牌
Right, well... that's not in the cards.

525
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,140
从外面上了锁
It's locked from the outside.

526
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,220
他们识破你了
They made you.

527
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,020
你真的是个被通缉的恐怖分子啊
You really are a wanted terrorist.

528
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,040
那你以为他说的都是什么
What the hell did you think he was saying?

529
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,530
我还以为只是个比喻
I thought it was an analogy.

530
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,650
天啊
For God's sake.

531
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,340
这房间里没有其他出路
There's no other way out of this cabin.

所有船员都到顶层甲板集合  都举起手来
All crew to the top deck. All hands up.

533
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,950
服从命令  否则我们会开枪射击
Comply or be fired on.

534
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,650
此船现已属于美国海军管辖
This ship is now under the control of the U.S. Navy.

535
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,080
准备登船
Prepared to be boarded.

536
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,510
追兵到了
We got company.

537
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,790
我建议跳船
I say we jump.

538
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,950
我们要游很长的距离
That's a long way down.

539
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,270
只有这条出路
It's the only way out.

540
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,210
太远了
It's too far.

541
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,450
我有个办法
I have an idea...

542
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,100
但得受点苦
...but it's gonna hurt.

543
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,350
{\an8}莎拉

544
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,460
喂
Hello?

545
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,240
海瑟  是我  听着  现在不方便说
Hey, Heather, it's me. Listen, I can't talk,

546
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,570
但我需要你现在去接麦克  好吗
but I need you to go pick up Mike right now, okay?

547
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,090
你知道帕特里克·门罗家住哪吗
Do you know where Patrick Monroe lives?

548

别把他带回来  好吗
Don't bring him back here, okay?

552
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
让他跟着你  我会尽快过去
Keep him with you. I'll be over as soon as I can.

你能帮我这个忙吗
Can you do that for me?

554
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,260
好  我现在就出门

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,750
没事吧
I-I-Is everything okay?

我往左  你往右
I'll go left, you right.

563
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,720
他们从窗户出去了
They went out the window!

564
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,280
他们从窗户出去了
They went out the window!

565
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,920

费尔南多·苏克雷

574
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,320
我是船员  看看名册

575
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,140
我和这事没关系
I got no part in any of this.

576
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,700
从名册里找费尔南多·苏克雷
Check the roster for Fernando Sucre.

577
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,020
此人似乎没有嫌疑

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,430
把他带到驾驶舱上去

Sir.

我不认识什么卡尼尔·乌提斯

很多年没见过了

他给我打电话  说需要我送他一程

他叫斯科菲尔德
The guy's name is Scofield!

590
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,360
苏克雷说的就是那扇门
That's the door Sucre told us about.

591
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,420
他们在那
There they are!

592
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,450
不许动  不许动
Freeze! Freeze!

593
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,980
快点  快点
Look alive, look alive!

594
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,400
他们无路可逃了
We've got them bottled up.

595
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,560
伙计们  快点  快点

00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,870
催泪瓦斯弹
Tear gas.

602
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,410
如果进了通风系统  我的货就毁了
That hits the ventilation, it's gonna ruin my cargo.

603
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
你向来都是个废物  苏克雷
You've always been a loser, Sucre.

604
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,830
我雇过的最烂的船员
Worst shipmate I ever hired.

605
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,430
你把这人渣带到我的船上来
You brought this scum on board my ship.

606
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,120
他们是你的朋友  他们要去哪

607
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,380
他们是熟人的熟人
They're associates of associates.

608
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,020
我很多年没见过他们了
I haven't seen them in years.

609
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,750
但你说到点子上了
But that's a good point.

610
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,910
不如你告诉这个面善的海豹突击队员
Why don't you tell the nice SEAL here

611
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,050
你是怎么收他们船票钱的
how you accepted payment for their passage?

612
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,010
可能他们是你的朋友  而不是我的
Maybe they're your friends, not mine.

613
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,320
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

614
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,820
我听到他们提到17号集装箱什么的
I heard them say something about container 17.

615
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,470
就是那个17号集装箱
That container 17.

616
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,000
就是装了你的绝密货物的那个  对吧
The one with your super secret cargo, huh?

617
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,690
武器弹药吧
Weapons and munitions?

618
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,530
文森特  目标可能持有武器
Vincent, tangos may be arming themselves.

619
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,520
如果他们发现武器肯定不会给你好脸色吧
Man, they're not gonna like you if they find that, are they?

620
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,540
文森特
Vincent.

621
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,890
你最终也可能上了针对恐怖分子的监视名单
You might just end up on the terrorist watch list, too.

622
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,410
文森特  听得到吗
Vincent, do you copy?

623
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,850
听不清楚
Can't read you.

624
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,460
毫无用处的墨西哥人  你算计好了的
Good-for-nothing Mexican. You planned this.

625
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,680
在这别动
Stay here.

626
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,490
17号还封着
17's still sealed.

627
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,050
船长
Captain?

628
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,710
哥可是波多黎各人
I'm Puerto Rican.

629
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,400
正前方  你们听到声音了吗
12 o'clock. You hear that?

630
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,650
快点
Come on!

631
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,200
快走  快走
Go, go. Move!

632
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,900
怎么回事
What's going on?

633
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,650
这船正在改变航线
The ship's changing course.

634
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,370
我做到了  兄弟
I did it, papi.

635
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,710
现在没有退路了
No going back now.

636
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,910
看看他们下一步怎么办
See what their next move is.

637
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,110
还记得我们的蜜月吗
Do you remember our honeymoon?

638
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,720
当然
Yeah, of course.

639
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,220
当时你向我敞开心扉
How you opened up.

640
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,500
跟我说你对在福克斯河监狱里做的事充满愧疚
Told me you carried shame for what you did at Fox River.

641
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,670
说你有时候都希望从来没听说过
How some days you wished you'd never heard

642
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,030
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德这个名字
the name Michael Scofield.

643
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,340
甚至  你还承认对我撒谎
Even admitted to lying,

644
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,940
对我隐瞒了所有真相
keeping it all from me.

645
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,070
当时的你最终向我坦白
How you finally came clean

646
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,920
并抛开一切过往
and put it all behind you?

647
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
没错
Sure.

648
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,240
我原谅了你对我撒谎
I forgave you for the lies.

649
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,960
原谅了你的过去
Your past.

650
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,010
接受了你
Accepted you.

651
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,310
疼爱你和麦克

652
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,250
这些对你来说还不够吗
How is that not enough for you?

653
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,050
喂
Hi.

654
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,260
喂
Hello?

655
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
我接到他了
I have him.

656
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,280
谢天谢地
Thank God.

657
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,520
他很好
He's fine.

658
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,040
正在回家的路上
Headed home now.

659
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
妈妈
Hi, Mom.

660
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,620
海瑟  感谢上帝
Heather, thank God.

661
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,420
我马上就到
I'll be there soon.

662
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,070
导航系统被破坏了
Navigation's been trashed,

663
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,190
控制系统也损坏了
the controls damaged.

664
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
见鬼
Damn it.

665
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,530
货船偏离了航线
Tramp's off course.

666
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,210
正在全速往阿尔及利亚海域行进
Moving toward Algerian waters, top speed.

667
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,690
我们能修好它吗
Can we fix it?

668
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,910
需要花时间
It'll take time.

669
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,760
修好的时候肯定已经出公海了
And by then we'd be out of international waters.

670
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,760
呼叫猎鹰一号  请求指令
Falcon One requesting orders.

671
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,640
出现了问题
We have a situation.

672
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,110
讲
Yeah.

673
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,530
海豹突击队无法解决乌提斯
The SEAL team failed to neutralize Outis.

674
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,190
船的控制系统被损坏了
Somehow the ship's controls were damaged.

675
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,420
船正载着我们的士兵驶向阿尔及利亚海域
It's headed for Algerian waters with our soldiers on boards,

676
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,000
但是  如果他们继续完成任务
but it'll cause a diplomatic incident

677
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,010
一定会引起国际争端
if they stay to finish the job.

678
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,120
海军已经决定撤回突击队
The navy just made the call to pull the team.

679
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,660
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

680
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,460
突击队解决不了  我们就升级行动
The SEALs couldn't do it. We escalate our move.

681
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,550
本不该小看了他们
Shouldn't have brought a knife to a gunfight.

682
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
我来负责以后的行动
I will handle from here.

683

684

长官
Sir.

说
Yes.

686
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,120
我有一个十分紧急的请求
I have an ask, one that's imperative.

687
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,290
我相信  你会发现我们利益是一致的
I believe you'll find that our interests are aligned.

688
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,200
他们在干什么
What are they doing?

689
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,630
他们在撤离
They're leaving.

690
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,710
为什么
Why?

691
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,280
跑
Run!

692
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,990
天啊  不  不  不 
Oh, God. No, no, no, no!

693
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,300
你会需要这个
You're gonna want this.

694
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,300
麦克很安全  你找不到了  这事结束了
Mike is safe where you can't touch him, and this is over.

695
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,940
你的生活  谎言  以及你的假面具
The life, the lies, the mask.

696
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,340
你都要如实地告诉我
You're gonna tell me everything.

697
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,560
比如说  你究竟是谁
Like who you really are,

698
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,440
这是怎么一回事  一切的一切
what this was, all of it.

699
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,270
这就是我们的生活
It was our life.

700
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,390
事情还没结束  莎拉
It's not over, Sara.

701
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,240
离结束还早着呢
Not even close.

702
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,700
麦克一直都没有危险
And Mike was never in danger.

703
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,570
我爱他
I love him.

704
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,320
他是我的家人
He is my family.

705
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,770
我养育了他
I raised him.

706
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,630
你又做了什么呢
What have you done?

707
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,730
不
No.

708
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,800
应该说  你做了什么  莎拉
It's what you've done, Sara.

709
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,190
这一切本可以避免的
All of this could've been avoided.

710
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,900
晚上在朋友家过夜好玩吗
Good sleepover?

711
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:32,890
好玩
Yeah.

712
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,750
妈妈会来接我吗
Is Mommy coming to pick me up?

713
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,440
当然
Yes, sir.

714
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,310
迈克尔死定了
Michael's dead.

715
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,240
你去希腊的"救人之旅"帮我找到了他
Your Nightingale trip to Greece led me straight to him.

716
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,130
所以  这都是你的错  莎拉
So... it's all on you, Sara.

717
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,490
你请海瑟帮忙的计划没有成功
And your plan with Heather didn't work.

718
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,510
我儿子呢
Where's my son?

719
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,510
在我手里
I have him.

720
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,180
至于我需不需要用他威胁你
And whether or not I have to threaten him--

721
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,800
虽然我也不想如此
which I don't want to do--

722
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,320
但这全看你要不要放下手里的枪了
is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.

723
