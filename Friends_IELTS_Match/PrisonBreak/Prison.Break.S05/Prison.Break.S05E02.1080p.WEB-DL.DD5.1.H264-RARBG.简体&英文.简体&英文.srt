二十四小时前他没有闪灯

-那本来是信号  -要有信心

-灯不会熄了  -得回去了
- Lights aren't going out. ‭- Got to go back.

109
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,260
不如试试直接跑
Maybe make a run for it.

110
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,340
距离太远了[变数太多]
Too much ground to cover. 

111
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,620
我们到不了缺口就会被射杀
They'll shoot us down before we make the gap.

112
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,230
那你怎么打算  坐以待毙吗
What's the plan then? Give up and die?

113
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,760
我可不能再等上四年了
I can't wait another four years.

114
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,340
本来说好只有一周的
It was supposed to be one week.

波塞冬把我们丢在这里等死
Poseidon has left us here to die. ‭

116

我们还有一步棋可以走
We still got one card left to play.

117
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,820
我本来不想这么做  但它已经开始了
I didn't want to play it, but it's already in motion.

118
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,260
我们走吧
Let's go.

119
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,450
卡尼尔·乌提斯显然是因为对抗政府
Apparently, Kaniel Outis was thrown into Ogygia

120
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,970
而被投进奥杰吉亚监狱
for crimes against the government.

121
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,060
不久以后  他因为企图逃跑
Shortly after, he was captured

122
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,960
被抓住  之后关了禁闭
trying to escape, and thrown into solitary.

123
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,410
他们最近刚释放他回囚区
They just released him into gen pop recently.

124
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,870
叫他迈克尔  行吗
Call him Michael, will you?

125
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,740
那为什么他见到我们时不肯认我们
But why didn't he acknowledge us when he saw us?

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,520
站住
Stop!

127
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,060
给我回来
Get back here!

128
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,430
-那孩子在监视我们  -是的
- Kid was spying on us. - Yeah.

129
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,130
他还在门垫下面留了个东西
And he left something under the doormat.

130
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,390
{\an5}找到光之酋长
我就会重获自由

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,070
{\an5}找到光之酋长
我就会重获自由

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,870
这是迈克尔的笔迹
This is Michael's handwriting.

133
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,330
天鹅是他的标志  他想联系我们
Swan was his calling card. He's reaching out to us.

134
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,340
但他干嘛搞得这么神秘
But why is he being so mysterious?

135
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,460
以前  他有没有说话这么拐弯抹角
Back in the day, he never talked to you straight, 

136
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,940
到了用暗号的程度
as in not in code? 

137
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,230
他是担心有人会拦截他的信息
He's worried about someone intercepting his message.

138
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,420
好吧  但这信息是什么意思
Yeah, but what does it mean?

139
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,810
我不知道  但他期望我们知道
I don't know, but we're supposed to know.

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,160
光之酋长  光之酋长
"Sheik of Light." ‭Sheik of Light.

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,540
听起来像是那种在山顶上
That sounds like a guy on a mountain peak

142
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,070
和真主交流的人
communing with God.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,260
我们得找人帮忙
Yeah, we got to get help.

144
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,680
-没人能帮我们  -希巴
- We're out of help. - ‭Sheba.

145
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,630
她认为我在帮助恐怖分子
She thinks I'm abetting a terrorist.

146
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,770
那你就得向她证明并非如此
Well, then you have to convince her that you're not.

147
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,400
您必须离开  爸爸
You have got to leave, Papa.

148
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,510
-我不会逃跑的  -政府正遭到攻击
- I will not run away. - The government is being targeted.

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,520
您也成了被攻击的对象
You are being targeted.

150
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,010
我是个无名小卒
I'm a no one.

151
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,810
您对他们来说等同于政府
You are government to them.

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,710
你不懂做一个也门人的意义
You don't understand being a Yemeni.

153
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,770
在祖国最需要你的时候  你会转身就跑吗
You would run away when she needs you the most?

154
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,010
我只知道我们死了对国家是毫无价值的
I understand that we are no good to this country dead.

155
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,380
爸爸  留得青山在  不怕没柴烧
Papa, there will come a time.

156
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,060
我们逃去海外  和流亡政府一起重整旗鼓
We go abroad, regroup with an exile government.

157
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,990
哪有钱供我们逃呢  孩子
With what money, girl?

158
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,460
得花费两年的工资啊
It would cost two years' salary.

159
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,680
我宁可直面敌人而死  也不愿当逃兵
I'd rather die with my face to the enemy than to run away.

160
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,010
爸爸
Papa...

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,240
我建议你尽快离开这个国家
I suggest you leave this country as quickly as you can.

162
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,880
他来干嘛
What's he doing here?

163
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,220
我朋友需要你的帮忙
My friend needs your help.

164
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,160
我给过他帮助了
I gave him my help.

165
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,240
你却没告诉我  他与我们的敌人勾结
You didn't tell me he was working with the enemy.

166
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,410
这个你声称是你弟弟的男人
This man you claim is your brother,

167
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,910
卡尼尔·乌提斯  和叛军勾结
Kaniel Outis, worked with the rebels.

168
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,550
-他叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德  -关我屁事
- His name's Michael Scofield. - I don't care!

169
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,410
不是卡尼尔·乌提斯
Not Kaniel Outis!

170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,020
现在不管你说什么
There's nothing you can say to me 

171
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,820
我都不会帮你  好吗
that will make me help you, okay?

172
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,200
是吗
Is that right?

173
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,320
这些足够带你全家离开这个国家了吧
This enough to get your family out of the country?

174
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,920
先给我办这件事
Deliver me this first.

175
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,200
{\an5}找到光之酋长
我就会重获自由

176
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,070
{\an5}纽约州  伊萨卡

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,760
准备好了吗  宝贝
Ready, love?

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,760
{\an2}我们昨天在奥杰吉亚监狱录下了这个
- 林肯

179
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,610
-那是什么  -这是...
- What's that? - It's, uh...

180
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,770
这是你林肯伯伯发来的东西
It's something your Uncle Lincoln sent.

181
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,010
-来吧  -我不想去
- Here. ‭- I don't want to go.

182
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,510
我想和你在一起
I want to stay with you.

183
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,410
你得去上学
You got to go to school.

184
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,010
下课的时候  我会在这里等着你
And I'm gonna be right here when the bell rings.

185
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,060
好吗  你从台阶上走下来
Okay? You walk down those steps,

186
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,390
直接上车  好吗
you hop straight into the car. Yeah?

187
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,540
我爱你
I love you.

188
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,180
祝你上学愉快
Make it a great day.

189
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,570
我收到你的消息了
I got the note.

190
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
我收到了  迈克尔
I got the note, Michael.

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
我们会把你救出来的
We're going to get you out of here.

192
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,380
听着  我不叫迈克尔
Look, my name isn't Michael,

193
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,040
我也不知道你是谁
and I don't know who you are.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,750
抱歉
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,810
{\an5}雅各布·奈斯

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,660
你知道我成了有名的经济学家吗
You know I'm a noted economist?

197
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,070
我是说  报纸上是这么写的
I mean, that's what it says in the paper.

198
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,450
"著名经济学家在家遇袭"
"Noted Economist Attacked in Home."

199
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,570
我都不知道经济学家都能上新闻
I didn't even know economists made the news.

200
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,830
但愿没有下次了
That's the first and last time, hopefully.

201
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,330
我一直想把这一切搞清楚
I've been trying to piece this thing together.

202
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,520
你还记得那些政府的人吗
You remember those government guys,

203
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,360
那些智囊团的家伙
those think tank guys,

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,820
想向我请教博弈论的东西
trying to pick my brain about game theory,

205
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,210
以及他们怎样才能把它用于外交政策上
how they could use it for foreign policy?

206
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,240
记得  他们烦透你了  对吗
Yeah, you bored the hell out of 'em, right?

207
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,210
对  但我的意思是
Yeah, okay, but I mean, 

208
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,280
我是不是刚听到了什么不该听到的
did I hear something I shouldn't have?

209
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,570
我不知道啊  你有听到吗
I don't know. Did you?

210
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,220
比如谁刺杀了肯尼迪
Like who shot JFK?

211
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,430
我可是认真的
I am trying to be serious here.

212
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,890
不  你是不是止痛药吃多了
No, you're doped up on painkillers

213
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,510
是你想太多了
and you're thinking too much.

214
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,550
我保证这和你一点关系也没有
I promise this has nothing to do with you.

215
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,560
好好休息吧  我要去...
You rest. I'm going to, um...

216
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,330
我还有些事要办  然后我再去看你  好吗
I'm gonna run some errands, and then I'm gonna come visit you, okay?

217
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,770
好的  爱你
Okay. Love you.

218
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
我也爱你
Love you, too.

219
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,030
{\an5}结束通话

220
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,360
好了  没问题  谢谢
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

221
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,570
我之前打电话问起过一名在中东失踪的美国公民
I, uh, I called earlier about a missing U.S. Citizen in the Middle East.

222
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,520
没错  我是亨利·岸田
Yes. I'm Henry Kishida.

223
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,300
我带你去局长办公室
Let me walk you to the director's office.

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,310
这种情况不常见
It's an unusual situation,

225
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,840
你应该感到庆幸
which you can appreciate,

226
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,210
毕竟你丈夫在法律上已经宣告死亡
since your husband is declared legally dead,

227
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,440
而且你提到这个人
and the person that you're referring to

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,030
使用的是另一个名字
goes by another name.

229
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,100
这里交给我吧  亨利
I'll take it from here, Henry.

230
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,440
你好吗  莎拉
How are you, Sara?

231
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,800
凯勒曼
Kellerman?

232
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,560
你们谈吧  有什么需要叫我  长官
I'll leave you two be. Let me know if you need anything, sir.

233
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,970
抱歉  我怎么又和你扯上关系了
‭Sorry, how did I end up with you again?

234
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,690
你向国务院提出求助
You asked for the State Department's help.

235
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,570
我想要国务院的帮忙  不是你
I wanted the State Department, not you.

236
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,090
你以前的身份太过复杂
Yeah, you've lived so many lives, 

237
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,030
不知道这次你扮演谁了
I don't know who you are.

238
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,550
你的处境不也一样吗  不是吗
That'd be a consistent theme for you, wouldn't it, 

239
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,980
你嫁了一个根本不存在的男人
given that you were married to a man who never existed?

240
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,570
你这话是什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

241
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,310
意思是你该进来  我会把关于
It means you should come in and let me enlighten you

242
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,490
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的事都告诉你
to all things Michael Scofield...

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,760
或者该管他叫卡尼尔·乌提斯
Or should I say Kaniel Outis?

244
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,720
你不该喝瓶装水的
You shouldn't drink bottled water-- 

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,460
里面都是二恶英  双酚A...[两者都有致癌性]
the dioxins, the BPAs in there...

246
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,760
很感激你关心我
I'm touched by your concern.

247
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,690
请坐
Have a seat.

248
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,100
不用了  谢谢
Good, thank you.

249
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,770
你知道的  莎拉
You know, Sara...

250
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,060
你和我有段...  波折的过往
you and I have... a checkered past.

251
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,580
但我现在就是个无趣之人  而且...
But I am evermore a boring guy now, and...

252
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,600
被生活磨平了棱角  相信我
mellowed by life, trust me.

253
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,510
如果你有关于迈克尔的消息想告诉我
If you have something you want to tell me about Michael,

254
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,830
就赶紧说吧
I'd sure love to hear it.

255
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,210
好吧
Okay. 

256
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,490
接到你的电话后岸田就进行了调查
When your call came in and Kishida processed it...

257
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,090
我就说些让我们甚为震惊的
well, let's just say there are certain keywords

258
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,320
关键词好了
that get our system buzzing pretty quickly.

259
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,660
卡尼尔·乌提斯...
Kaniel Outis...

260
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,120
其实  我实在受不了你用瓶子喝水
Actually, can't stand it watching you drink out of that.

261
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,380
岸田
Hey, Kishida?

262
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,700
能帮莎拉倒杯水吗
Could you bring Sara a glass for her water, please?

263
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,450
谢谢
Thank you.

264
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,880
卡尼尔·乌提斯...
Kaniel Outis...

265
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,870
是一名因杀害
is a known terrorist,

266
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,800
一名中情局高级官员
ties to ISIL, wanted in the killing

267
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,210
而被通缉的ISIL恐怖分子
of a senior CIA official.

268
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,170
迈克尔不会杀人的
Michael's no killer. ‭

269
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,690
这就是问题所在
You see, that's the problem.

270
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,960
因为卡尼尔·乌提斯会
Because Kaniel Outis is.

271
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,180
-谢谢  -不用谢
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

272
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,230
而且...
And...

273
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,430
这就是卡尼尔·乌提斯
this is Kaniel Outis.

274
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,530
简直荒唐
That's ridiculous.

275
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,150
{\an8}卡尼尔·乌提斯  系ISIL恐怖分子
因杀害一名中情局高级官员
并制造多起爆炸案
而被中情局  联调局通缉

276
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,060
官方记录显示...
The record here at State says that... 

277
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,830
这张脸就是卡尼尔·乌提斯
that's Kaniel Outis's face. 

278
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,240
好吧  但你我都知道迈克尔·斯科菲尔德是谁
‭Okay, but you and I both know who Michael Scofield was.

279
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,780
不  那只是回忆
No, that's just a memory.

280
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,050
官方记录  包括他的过去
The official record-- history--

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,840
都已经不同了
it says otherwise now.

282
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,320
你想想幕后主使  那才叫恐怖
Now, that's scary, to think who could be behind that.

283
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,260
因为只有那种非常厉害的角色
Because only somebody very formidable

284
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,230
才能做到
would be capable

285
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,370
在官方层面为一个人更改身份
of officially turning one man into another.

286
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,310
比如像迈克尔那样的天才
It would take a genius... like Michael.

287
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,530
你是在暗示这是他自己策划的吗
You're insinuating that he did this?

288
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,290
他消失了
He disappeared,

289
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,940
就这样放弃了他的生活吗
just quit on his life?

290
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,670
我和你一样想要知道答案
I want answers just like you do.

291
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,410
谁能办到这种事
Who's capable of this?

292
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,720
全世界能做到的人屈指可数
Only a handful of people in the world.

293
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,050
莎拉  莎拉
Sara? Sara!

294
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,680
我们应该还有一天
I figure we got a day,

295
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,470
顶多两天时间离开这鬼地方
maybe two, tops, to get out of this hole.

296
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,330
等到那时  我们要么是被炮弹炸死...
At that point, either the shelling gets us...

297
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,660
要么被ISIL的人干掉
or ISIL does.

298
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,680
你一点都不担心吗
Does any of this faze you at all?

299
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,950
我们马上就要死在这里了
The fact that we're gonna die in here?

300
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,150
我们不会死  我们还是会逃出去的
We're not gonna die. We're still getting out.

301
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,490
我们所有人
All of us.

302
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,340
怎么逃  通过房顶吗
How's that? The roof?

303
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,520
-房顶行不通的  -能行得通
- The roof ain't happening. - The roof is happening.

304
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,410
我们没有时间再想一套越狱方案了
We don't have time to come up with another escape plan.

305
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,750
所以你确实紧张了
So you are nervous.

306
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,310
好极了  现在我知道我在劫难逃了
Great, now I know I'm in deep crap.

307
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,870
{\an5}找到光之酋长  我将重归自由

308
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,920
我做这些只是为了钱
I'm only doing this for the money.

309
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,220
别以为咱俩关系突然变好了
Don't think you and I are suddenly good.

310
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,450
你只管帮我找到酋长就行
You just deliver me the sheik.

311
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,360
酋长们离这里很远
The sheiks are well away from here.

312
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,990
在沙漠高原
High desert.

313
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,320
而且我从没听说过有叫光之酋长的
And I've never heard of one being referred to as Sheik of Light.

314
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,930
也就是说这可能是暗语
Which means it's probably a code.

315
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,020
她真了解你弟
She knows your brother.

316
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,940
这条纸带
This tape--

317
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,070
是唯一一个不属于这张纸的东西
it's the only thing that doesn't belong.

318
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,430
你弟弟喜欢说谜语  是不是
Your brother speaks in riddles, does he?

319
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,440
有可能是盲文  或者是摩尔斯码
‭Maybe it's Braille or, uh, Morse.

320
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
或者只是数字
Or just numbers.

321
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,680
我觉得是个电话号码
I think it's a phone number.

322
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,910
语音信箱
Voice mail.

323
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,010
穆罕默德·埃尔·突尼斯
Mohammad El-Tunis.

324
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,930
萨那的电气工程主任
Director of Electrical Works in Sana'a.

325
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,960
电气工程主任
Director of Electrical Works.

326
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,400
"光之酋长"
"Sheik of Light."

327
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,060
{\an5}电气工程部
萨那

328
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,420
感谢您百忙之中来见我们
Thanks for taking the time to see us.

329
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,090
人都哪去了
Where is everybody?

330
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,000
他们事先就逃走了
They are fleeing ahead of the advance.

331
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,130
我们一直在找他
We have been trying to reach him.

332
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,470
我们只知道他去了郊区
All we know is that he went to the suburbs

333
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,170
去找他的女儿
to try to find his daughter.

334
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,700
你有她的地址吗
Do you have an address for her?

335
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,830
我们试着给她打过电话了  但是没人接
We tried calling her, but no answer.

336
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,200
这是地址
Address is here.

337
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,460
你们不会是想去找他吧
You are not going to try to find him, are you?

338
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,600
愿真主与你们同在
God be with you, then.

339
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,720
地址圈出来了
Circled the address.

340
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
祝你们好运
Good luck.

341
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,520
你跟我们一起走
You're coming with us.

342
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,360
如果你以为我会去郊区的话
If you think I'm going into the suburbs,

343
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,150
那你们就是疯了
you're crazy.

344
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,330
郊区怎么了
What's wrong with the suburbs?

345
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,630
郊区在那边
The suburbs are out there.

346
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,890
战争的前线
The front line of the war.

347
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,390
很高兴认识你  还有你本杰明
Nice knowing you, Benjamin.

348
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,930
我希望下次见面时  状况能好些
I hope next time it's under better circumstances.

349
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,560
-付钱吧  -你得带我们通过关卡
- Pay up. - You have to get us past the checkpoint.

350
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,380
我们俩美国人  没有你我俩啥都办不成
Two Americans-- we'll never make it without you.

351
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,000
我可不想自杀
I am not getting myself killed.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
付钱
Pay up.

353
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,690
给我找到酋长
Deliver the sheik.

354
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,090
我就给你钱
Then you get your money.

355
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,380
上车
Get in.

356
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,790
喂
Yes?

357
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,580
看一下你的邮箱  莎拉
You should check your e-mail, Sara.

358
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,460
我看的这是什么
What am I looking at?

359
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,630
一个猎人四年前拍的照片
Footage captured by a hunter four years ago.

360
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,050
用一种挂在树上的运动传感器
One of those motion sensor devices you hang on trees,

361
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,250
可以间歇性拍摄猎物
takes intermittent photos of prey.

362
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,290
有一天早晨  猎人出门发现了这些图片
Hunter comes out one morning, finds these images.

363
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,660
这就是我跟你说的那起谋杀
This is the killing I was telling you about.

364
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,660
受害者是哈伦·盖恩斯  中情局副局长
The victim's Harlan Gaines, Deputy Chief of the CIA.

365
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,580
而杀手...
And the killer...

366
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,440
你也看到了
well, you can see,

367
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,890
就是被我们称为迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的人
it's who we call Michael Scofield,

368
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,990
或者卡尼尔·乌提斯
or Kaniel Outis, or...

369
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,720
当初他们对林肯用的也是这招
This is exactly what they did to Lincoln.

370
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,740
第二天就有血迹证据了
And then there's the blood evidence the next day.

371
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,670
卡尼尔或者迈克尔上了去也门的飞机
Kaniel or Michael or whatever gets on a flight to Yemen.

372
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,500
他下飞机时  我们差点就抓住他了
We all most nail him when he lands.

373
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,400
但跑了和尚跑不了庙  他的行李还在
He gets away. His luggage doesn't

374
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,490
里面的衣服上全是盖恩斯的血
and Gaines' blood is all over the clothes inside.

375
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,130
证据确凿
The evidence is overwhelming.

376
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,300
不论你想叫他什么名字
Whatever name you want to call him,

377
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,160
迈克尔都是凶手  萨拉
Michael's a murderer, Sara.

378
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,590
你没事吧
Are you all right?

379
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,300
你还好吗
You all right?

380
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,000
这老习惯吗  嗯  我挺好的
This old thing? Yeah, I'm doing fine.

381
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,210
怎么了
What's going on?

382
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,030
我需要你的建议
I need your advice.

383
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,870
但你可能不想谈论这件事
It's probably something you're not gonna want to talk about.

384
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,750
但我真的很需要你清晰的思路
I could really use your clarity right now.

385
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,110
事关迈克尔
It's about Michael.

386
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,380
我还是想知道他是怎么把这东西弄进来的
Still want to know how he got that in here.

387
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,670
跟狱警睡了
Hugging naked with the guards.

388
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,940
肯定的吧
Got to be, right?

389
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,510
那是什么
What the hell is that?

390
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,850
《我们是冠军》
"We are the Champions."

391
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,060
*我们是冠军*
*We are the champions*

392
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,010
你困在这么个厕所一样的地方  还看皇后乐队
You get stuck in a Porta-Potty like this, you go Queen?

393
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,310
怎么不看点女人自慰的小黄片呢
I mean, where are the girls riding the washing machines, right?

394
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,010
再看我的屏幕  我就用它戳瞎你的狗眼
Look at my screen again, this goes in your eye.

395
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,190
大千世界无奇不有
You know, the world never ceases to amaze.

396
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,630
被关在中东的监狱里
You get stuck in a Middle Eastern prison,

397
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,650
而里面最混蛋的却是个韩国棒子
the biggest S.O.B. is a Korean.

398
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,100
他停药后犯瘾了
He's in withdrawal.

399
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,660
*因为我们是*
*'Cause we are the champions*

400
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,290
*世界冠军*
*Of the world... *

401
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,520
知道吗  他是这世界上
You know, he's the biggest collector

402
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,020
最大的皇后乐队周边收藏家
of Queen paraphernalia in the world.

403
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,240
据说他首尔的家就是个佛莱迪·摩克瑞的神龛
They say his house in Seoul is a shrine to Freddy Mercury.

404
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,660
那他怎么被关进来的
And he got in here how?

405
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,060
身份盗窃
Identity theft.

406
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,140
显然他经常坐在自家沙发上
Apparently he used to sit on his couch,

407
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,820
黑进世界各国的高额网络账户
hack high net worth accounts all over the world.

408
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,060
然后用这些钱来收藏悍马车  直升机
Turned it into a collection of Hummers, helicopters

409
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,980
当然还有佛莱迪·摩克瑞的骨灰
and, apparently, Freddy Mercury's ashes.

410
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,150
等等  你是说他火化的骨灰吗
Wait, you mean like his burnt-up body?

411
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,070
据说佛莱迪被火化了  但骨灰却不见了
The story is Freddy's cremated, but his ashes go missing.

412
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,410
至今没有人知道下落
To this day no one knows where they are.

413
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,910
有一次雅嗑嗨了之后告诉我是他买下了
Ja admitted to me once when he was high he bought them.

414
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,430
两百万美金
Two million bucks.

415
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,070
皇后乐队的主唱都能在他家客厅里
He's got Queen's lead singer in his family room.

416
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,730
你是怎么知道这些的
How exactly do you know all this?

417
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,910
我问他的
I asked him.

418
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,050
他没犯瘾时  真的是个大好人
He's a real mensch when he's not in withdrawal.

419
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,510
我都不知道你跟他说过话
I didn't know you talked to him.

420
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,610
赞啊
Amazing.

421
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,570
我还以为我懂你了  原来我不懂
Just when I think I know your game, I don't.

422
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,270
你懂我的  维普
You know my game, Whip.

423
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,760
对  就是这一声"维普"
See, right there, "Whip."

424
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,380
我都不知道你为什么这么叫我
I don't even know why you call me that.

425
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,930
因为你是我的得力干将
Because you're my whip hand.

426
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,630
我的王牌
My ace in the hole.

427
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,450
好吧
Yeah, sure, okay.

428
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,800
在博弈论中  你需要成为两面派
See, in game theory, it serves you to be two-faced.

429
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,320
和每个人做朋友  直到你再不需要为止
Be everyone's friend till the moment you're not.

430
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,130
你要让大家都爱你至深  在关键时刻
You make them love you so much that when they're up against it,

431
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,540
朋友间的义气会让他们
their loyalty will make them act

432
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,810
做出违背自己最高利益的事情
against their own best interests.

433
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,630
这就是博弈论
That's game theory.

434
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,980
冷静  理智  专注于赢
A cold, rational focus on winning.

435
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,870
尽管需要牺牲其他所有人
Even if it's at everyone else's expense.

436
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,270
我想知道的是他想得到什么
What I'm trying to understand is what he stands to gain.

437
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,330
离开他的家人  用新的身份生活
Leaving his family, and-and the new identity.

438
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,540
从你告诉我的那点事来看  他变了
According to the little you've told me, he was different.

439
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,120
他总是有自己的小算盘  不是吗
Always an agenda, right?

440
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,000
是
Yeah.

441
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,770
他显然很爱你
I mean, he apparently loved you.

442
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,450
他当然爱你了
Of course he loved you.

443
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,850
他怎么会不爱你呢
How could he not?

444
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,290
但他也想要你为他打开监狱的那扇门
But he also wanted you to open that door in the prison for him.

445
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,720
在真正的博弈论中
I mean, true game theory,

446
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,070
任何事  任何人
everything, everyone

447
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,410
都是一个偶然事件
is a contingency.

448
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,050
你会遇见别人  把他们带入自己的生活
You meet people, you bring them into your life

449
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,710
你会和他们一直搞好关系
and you keep them percolating until the moment

450
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,560
直到需要为自己而利用这些关系的那一刻
you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.

451
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,300
我不是在评判他  我不是那样的人
I'm not judging, you know? That's not my thing.

452
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,160
-我知道  -你了解我的  但是...
- I know. - You know me. But...

453
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,040
陷得太深
...schema as deep

454
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,150
算得太深  到最后
and as calculating as that can, in the end,

455
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,180
会把人逼疯
spin a man off into madness.

456
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,950
最开始他可能觉得为了顾全大局
He might initially think smaller evils are okay

457
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,950
可以纵容小恶
in the service of a greater good.

458
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,790
比如帮林肯越狱
Like breaking Lincoln out of prison.

459
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,890
不过善与恶有时难以分辨
But the dance of good and evil could become jumbled,

460
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,920
以至对他人的操控
and the manipulation itself

461
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,870
成了最重要的事
becomes the most important thing.

462
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,380
人会变得一心求胜
Becomes about winning

463
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,080
而不去考虑胜利本身是对是错
rather than whether the game should be won at all.

464
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,650
我从未见你这样害怕过
I don't think I've seen you this scared before.

465
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,670
他们说  这次"斋月"为示宽恕
They say, for Ramadan, as an act of forgiveness,

466
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,670
{\pos(192,249.409)}[伊斯兰教历的九月  该月内伊斯兰教徒每日从黎明到日落禁食]

467
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
他们要把那里面
they're going to release all prisoners

468
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,050
所有被禁闭的囚犯都释放到囚区
from solitary over there back into general population.

469
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,940
他们是最穷凶极恶之徒
Worst of the worst.

470
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,770
ISIL恐怖组织的狂热分子
ISIL fanatics.

471
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,170
阿布·拉马尔
Abu Ramal.

472
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,760
你知道他们会杀了我的
They're going to kill me, you know.

473
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,050
我因为是同性恋
Government gave me 20 years

474
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,000
被政府判了二十年
for homosexuality.

475
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,500
但是那里面的魔鬼
But the monsters in there,

476
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,270
拉马尔和他的手下
Ramal and his men,

477
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,120
不会让我活过二十分钟
won't let me live 20 minutes.

478
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,220
拜托告诉我
Please tell me

479
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,400
你仍然打算把我们弄出这个地方
you still plan on getting us out of here.

480
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,680
你当时负责熄灯
You were responsible for killing the lights,

481
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,560
而你的光之酋长却在关键时刻不知所踪
and then your Sheik of Light went missing at exactly the wrong time.

482
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,490
我不知道他发生了什么事
I don't know what happened to him.

483
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,990
也许我能想到别的办法
Maybe I can find another way.

484
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,020
有件事你倒是能做
There is something you could do.

485
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,770
给我一片口香糖
Give me a piece of that gum.

486
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,640
凭一片口香糖就能让我们越狱吗
Piece of gum is going to get us out of prison?

487
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,890
它将成为导火索
It'll start the process.

488
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,360
朋友  有时我都分不清
Sometimes, my friend, I can't tell which is bigger,

489
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,660
是你的计划更大还是你的谎言更大
your plans or your lies.

490
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,040
我可记住了  你说我是个骗子
I take that personally, you calling me a liar.

491
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,020
我会让你见识到  就像蝴蝶效应一样
And I'm gonna show you, just like the butterfly's wings,

492
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,910
这片口香糖会引发一系列事件
this piece of gum is gonna start a sequence of events

493
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,140
最终会让我们来到监狱高墙之外
that will finish on the other side of the world.

494
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,810
给我电池

你确定要这么做吗
You sure about this?

502
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,610
我们没有时间了
There's no time left.

503
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,250
这座城市快要沦陷了
The city's about to collapse.

504
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,170
非常时期  非常手段
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

505
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,730
好了
Got it.

506
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,960
快点  快点  快点
Come on, come on, come on.

507
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,150
快  快  快
Go, go, go.

狱警

有人生病了
We got a sick one in here.

510
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,630
怎么回事
What is this?

511
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,620
他在发高烧  需要去趟医务室
He's burning up. He needs the infirmary.

512
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,550
拜托了
Please.

513
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,990
我们到了
This is it.

514
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,590
政府控制区边界
Limit of government control.

515
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,090
外面都是ISIL恐怖组织的领地
Anything after this is ISIL territory.

516
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,520
停车
Stop.

517
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,330
让我来谈
Let me do the talking.

518
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,670
他说我们是欧美人还有女人
He says us being Westerners, a woman...

519
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,820
一旦进去  就有去无回了
we go inside, we are not coming back.

520
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,560
他们不放我们通过
They're not letting us through.

521

告诉他  我赌500美金能安全返回
Tell him I bet $500 bucks we'll make it back in one piece.

522
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,950
他没有500美金来和你赌
He doesn't have $500 to bet.

523
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,090
不重要
It doesn't matter.

524
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,810
我们要是回不来  这钱就归他了
We don't make it back, he keeps it.

525
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,260
他说我们这是去送死
He says we have a death wish.

526
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,090
行吧
Fine.

527
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,960
这座城市曾经很美丽  充满生机
The city used to be beautiful, alive.

528
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,090
看看他们都干了什么
Look what they've done to it.

529
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,520
他们在到处张贴阿布·拉马尔的画像
They're putting up portraits of Abu Ramal.

530
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,320
他自从被关进奥杰吉亚监狱后
He's only gotten more powerful

531
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,680
就变得越来越有势力
since he got locked up in Ogygia.

532
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,950
他要是出狱了  我们就只能求真主保佑了
God help us if he gets out.

533
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,100
ISIL的人
ISIL.

534
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,450
我们的车会被拦下来  趴下
We're gonna get stopped. Get down.

535
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,810

藏好

537
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,520

真不敢相信
Can't believe this.

539
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,050
我认识他

雷扎
Reza.

543
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,150
现在是阿布·阿米尔
It's Abu Amir now.

544
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,950
你在城郊干什么  希巴
What are you doing in the suburbs, Sheba?

545
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,440
拐错弯了 
Took a wrong turn.

546
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,840
你把头发罩起来了
You got your hair covered up.

547
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,610
很好
That's good.

548
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,980
终于找到真主了吗
Finally find God?

549
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,200
不是你的真主
Not your God.

550
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,830
世上只有一位真主
There is only one God.

551
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,460
我们会拿下这座城市  你知道的
We're gonna take the city, you know.

552
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,810
只要你乖乖的

553
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,440
或许我能让你成为一个好女人

554
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,480
原谅你内心的魔鬼
Forgive the devil in you.

555
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,400
不如我现在就掉头
Why don't I just turn around now?

556
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,960
我们原谅彼此
We forgive each other.

557
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,630
忘记彼此的存在
Forget each other ever existed.

558
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,310
美人可不是那么轻易就被忘记的
Beauty is not so easily forgotten.

559
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,000
"万人迷"[绰号]
Lover boy!

560
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,350
我们得走了
We have to go.

561
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,350
政府军正逼近阿克萨公园

563
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,240
滚出我们的地盘

他们走了

我们得赶快
We have to hurry.

566
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,410
他刚才没杀我  算我们走运
We're lucky he didn't kill me right then.

567
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,570
为什么
Why?

568
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,480
没准我将来会告诉你
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

569
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,310
他们正在摧毁我们的城市
They're destroying our city.

570
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,450
你的那些ISIL朋友正在摧毁我们的城市
Your ISIL friends are destroying our city.

571
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,310
而你现在却跑来寻求帮助
And you come in here wanting help.

572
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,530
随便给我点什么吧
Just give me a little something.

573
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,680
这里有医生吗  我在发高烧
Is there a doctor here? I'm burning up.

574
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,150
你早该想到会有今天了
You should have thought about that,

575
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,610
在你给他们提供武器的时候
when you supplied guns to them,

576
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,890
在你杀害那些好人的时候
assassinated good men.

577
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,120
那些指控是一场误会
Those charges were a misunderstanding.

578
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,310
真主啊
Oh, Allah.

579
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,310
卡尼尔·乌提斯说这是一场误会
Kaniel Outis says it was a misunderstanding.

580
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,220
那么你进监狱的那一刻
Was it also a misunderstanding

581
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,660
就在企图越狱
when you tried to escape

582
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,170
这是不是也是一场误会啊
the moment you got into this prison? Hmm?

583
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,800
诚实的人不会试图去越狱
An honest man doesn't try to escape,

584
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,100
而是会请律师

585
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,120
但你自打进来的第一周就盘算着越狱
But you, you tried to escape the very first week.

586
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,940
要是我能做主  我会让你一辈子关禁闭
I'd have left you in solitary forever if it was up to me.

587
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,800
就是这个街区尽头的地址
The address at the end of the block.

588
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,490
是叛军
Rebels...

589
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,230
就在房子前面
right in front of the house.

590
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,960
这帮浑蛋
Son of a bitch.

591
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,780
在也门还有什么事是能轻松办到的
Anything easy in this country?

592
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,040
问题是  酋长究竟在不在里面
The question is: Is the Sheik even inside?

593
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,020
只有一个办法能找到答案
Only one way to find out.

594
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,950
要是在这上面被发现
‭They find us up here,

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,970
我们就没有解释的机会了
there's no explaining ourselves.

596
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,160
我们就死定了
We're all dead.

597
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,680
别出声
Quiet.

598
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,750
你们不是ISIL的人吗
You... You are not ISIL?

599
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,160
不  你是穆罕默德·埃尔·突尼斯  对吧
No. But you're Mohammad El-Tunis, I take it?

600
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,170
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}附近还有人

601
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,850
我们是从市中心来的
We are from the city center.

602
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,230
来救你出去
We are here to get you out.

603
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,630
除非让我女儿也一起走
Not without my daughter.

604
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,610
我们可以带上她  她人呢
We can bring her. Where is she?

605
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,260
-她就在外面  -哪里
- She's out there. - ‭Where?

606
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,570
在街对面那间学校的地窖里
In the basement of the schoolyard, across the street.

607
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,290
ISIL的人一来  她就被困在那里
Pinned since ISIL arrived.

608
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,910
我本想来救她出来
I came to get her out.

609
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,630
结果我也被困住了
And I got pinned, too.

610
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,750
林肯  恕我直言
I hate to say it, Linc,

611
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,920
但我估计我们也一起被困住了
but I think we might've just got pinned as well.

612
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,870
你没事吧
You okay?

613
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,890
你看着像想要挨几刀
You look like you could use a few sharp edges

614
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,700
直接升天的人
knocked off your world.

615
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,360
彼此彼此
You don't look so good yourself.

616
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,500
对于也门  你想了解些什么
Say what you want about Yemen,

617
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,320
给起药品来他们倒是不吝啬
they're not shy about prescriptions.

618
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,400
这可是好玩意儿啊  吗啡衍生物
It's the good stuff. Morphine derivative.

619
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,490
我要用你的手机和信用卡号
I need access to your cell phone and a credit card number.

620
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,530
干嘛
Why?

621
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,220
叫份披萨
I want to order a pizza.

622
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,130
有个后门通往学校
There's a back door, toward the schoolhouse.

623
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,980
跟我来
Come on.

624
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,130
太迟了
Too late.

625
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,630
去屋顶上  
Go to the rooftops. 

626
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,880
他们遍布在那辆路虎的四周
They're all over the Rover.

627
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,930
我们跑不到那里
We'll never get to it. ‭

628
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:27,960
我可以到那辆小货车上
I can get in that pickup,

629
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,700
冲出去制造骚乱
make a ruckus on my way out.

630
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,100
顺利的话  他们会把我团团包围
Any luck, they'll be all over me.

631
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,850
然后你们趁四周没人赶紧上路虎
Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.

632
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,900
走  快走
Go. Go!

633
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,870
没有女儿  我哪也不去
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

634
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,450
你们不懂ISIL的人渣会使出什么手段
You don't know what ISIL will do to her

635
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,230
来对付像她这种教女孩们读书的人
for educating those girls.

636
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,730
我会救她出来  我保证
I'll get her out, I promise.

637
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,750
-快走  -好  好
- Go! - Okay! Okay.

638
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,400
你父亲让我来的  我来救你出去
Your father sent me. I'm getting you out of here.

639
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,570
快出来  快出来
Come on! Come on!

640
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,030
趴下  别起来
Get down! Stay down!

641
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,800
他一定得成功
He's got to make it.

642
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,650
你必须成功  给点力啊
You know you got to make it. Come on.

643
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,230
他来了  他来了
There he is! There he is!

644
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,500
太他妈帅了
Yeah, baby!

645
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,360
不  情况不妙
Oh, no. This isn't good.

646
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,900
情况非常不妙
This isn't good.

647
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,450
政府设的关卡
This government checkpoint.

648
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,900
他们会误会我们是自杀式炸弹袭击者
They'll think we're suicide bombers.

649
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,710
我们得停车
We have to stop.

650
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,180
你他妈疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

651
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,960
别开枪
Don't shoot at us!

652
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,840
别开枪  别开枪
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

653
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,460
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}枪手  打那个枪手

654
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,650
趴下
Stay down!

655
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,620
我也很开心
I'm so happy, too.

656
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,890
抱歉
Forgive me, uh...

657
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,590
她们的父母都被杀害了
Their parents have been killed.

658
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,860
我正想办法怎么才能帮到她们
I'm trying to figure out how I can help them.

659
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,270
她们可以暂时留在这
They can stay here for now.

660
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,230
只要告诉我  你在奥杰吉亚都认识谁
As long as you tell me who you know in Ogygia,

661
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,860
还有他们为什么那么需要你
and why they want you so bad.

662
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,240
我只是个...
I'm a man with, uh...

663
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,630
"问题孩子"的父亲
troublesome children.

664
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,180
他们是很好的孩子
They're beautiful.

665
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,160
但可能对于这个国家来说太离经叛道了
But perhaps too modern for this country.

666
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,180
我女儿想要教女孩们读书
My daughter tries to educate girls.

667
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,830
而我儿子
And my son,

668
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,220
他爱上了一个男人
he falls in love with another man.

669
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,070
因此他被判了在奥杰吉亚服刑二十年
They gave him 20 years in Ogygia Prison.

670
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,190
几周前我去看他
I went to visit him a few weeks ago.

671
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,170
他说  可能有办法出去
He said, maybe there is a way out.

672
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,290
一个我能帮上忙的方法
A way I could help.

673
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,880
一个男人不能眼看着家人被杀
A man is not a man if he would let his family die.

674
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,340
你答应了帮他
You agreed to help him.

675
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,190
那怎么帮
How?

676
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,390
他说只要我能想办法让全城停电
He said if I could arrange a blackout,

677
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,920
他... 他认识的一个人就能帮他逃出来
he... he knew someone who could get him out.

678
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,070
是个美国人吗
An American?

679
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,290
不知道
I don't know.

680
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,100
我本应该在一周前就安排好
I-I was supposed to do this a week ago,

681
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,330
但我女儿又出了这状况
but then this happened with my daughter.

682
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,080
感谢真主  你们找回了我们
Thank God you found us.

683
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,740
现在还有时间来实施计划
There's still time to do it.

684
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,370
他们正在监狱里等你
They're waiting for you in there.

685
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,140
那我现在就得走了
Then I have to go now.

686
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,100
他说我要准确地
He said I was to give a signal

687
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,370
在停电前24小时  给他们发一个信号
exactly 24 hours before the blackout.

688
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,310
我会让电网跳闪两次
I will pulse the power grid twice.

689
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,940
恐怕这座城市撑不到24小时了
This city may not have 24 hours in it.

690
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,290
再见  小家伙们
Bye, guys.

691
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,360
拜拜
Bye.

692
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,190
天知道我看人有多么不准
God knows I'm no perfect judge of character,

693
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,360
但对迈克尔不会
but Michael?

694
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,760
要是他们说的有那么一点是真的...
If any of what they're saying is true...

695
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,670
所以还有很多细节需要核实  莎拉
So there's more to find out, Sara.

696
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,690
重要的是  不管结果如何 
I mean, the important thing is that you are gonna survive this,

697
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,310
你都会度过这一关的
however it turns out.

698
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,750
而且我们会支持你的  好吗
And we're here for you. Okay?

699
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,860

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,560
所有孩子都出来了
All the kids have been released.

704
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,380
你没接到他吗
You don't have him?

705
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,280
麦克
Mike?

706
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,250
-我去这边找  -好

708
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,570
你看见麦克了吗
Have you seen Mike?

709
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:57,790
麦克

710
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,620
麦克

你在...

What are you doing? You scared me.

714
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,250
我在看那个人去哪了
I was looking for where the man went.

715
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,180
什么人  宝贝
What man, baby?

716
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,010
给我这个的人
The man that gave me this.

披萨外卖员
The pizza man.

718
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,270
披萨外卖员
The pizza man?

719
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,890
{\an5}风暴即将至  众生须躲藏

720
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
迈克尔
Michael.

721
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,940
你陷入了什么麻烦呢
What are you into?

722
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,010
ISIL恐怖组织每时每刻都在逼近
ISIL is getting closer by the hour.

723
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,280
这里的叛乱者也都清楚
And the rebels in here know it.

724
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,300
等ISIL占领了这里  他们就会杀了我们
When they take over, they'll kill all of us.

725
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,490
异教徒  罪人  外国人
Infidels, the sinners, the foreigners.

726
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,220
感谢真主
Praise Allah.

727
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,890
有人找到了我的父亲
Someone found my father.

728
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,990
那意味着越狱开始了
Means the escape is on.

729
