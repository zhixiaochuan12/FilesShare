《越狱》前情提要K
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:06,205
有一个可信度高的证人刚出面 而且他愿意作证
A very credible witness has just come forward and he's willing to testify.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,171
你所说的阴谋 他全都可以证实
He'll corroborate everything you've said about this conspiracy.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,775
是谁？
Who?

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,404
你对索拿了解多少 金先生？
How much do you know about sona, Mr. Kim?

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,382
只了解上级透露给我的资讯 现在策略有些改变
Only what I've been given clearance on. There's been a change in strategy.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,318
-我还要再走多远？ -这次你只需要去巴拿马
- How much further would I have to go? - For this, you only have to go to Panama.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,788
-我不知道你会来 -你传讯说茶包在这
- I didn't know you were gonna be here. - You e-mailed me. You said T-Bag was here.

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,119
-你在网站上留言 -我没在网站上留言
- It's on the website. - I didn't write on no website.

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,695
-这件事越看越像陷阱 -他把犸丽囚禁起来
- This is looking more and more like a setup. - He's got Maricruz locked away.

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,197
我一定得帮他拿到钱 不然她就得等死
Either I help him get the money or she's dead.

12
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,130
站住，包威
Freeze, Bagwell!

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,605
西奥多包威 里面那个死女人是他杀的
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one you want for that dead chick in there.

14
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,107
-苏克，你最好振作点 -天啊
- Sucre, you better pull it together. - Oh, God!

15
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,212
去把钱抢回来，拜托
Go get the money. Please.

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,980
你在骗谁啊？
Who you fooling?

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,120
你不可能杀我的，白面书生
You ain't gonna kill me, Mr. Michelangelo.

18
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,618
你没那种胆量
You ain't got it in you.

19
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,949
-林克？ -你好，迈克
- Linc? - Hello, Michael.

20
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,895
你想干嘛，亚历？
What do you want, Alex?

21
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,894
把钱和船都交给我
Bring me the money. Bring me the boat.

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,589
你疯了
You are out of your mind.

23
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,563
我们手上都有 对方需要的东西
We have something the other person needs.

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,430
你的计划换你哥一命
Your brother for your plan,

25
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,401
我只给你五分钟考虑
Five minutes. That's what you have.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,912
我没有杀人
I didn't kill that man,

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,011
我要把你救出去
I'm getting you out of here,

28
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,850
-我只剩下三周的时间 -对我有信心一点
- I got three weeks, - Just have a little faith,

29
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,623
我已经尽力了
I did everything I could,

30
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,160
我知道
I know you did,

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,875
先生
senor.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,740
-要口香糖吗？ -不要
- Chicle? - No.

33
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,282
汽水？ 那啤酒呢，朋友？
Soda? Beer, my friend.

34
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,112
大麻烟？魔菇
Spleef? Magic mushrooms.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,120
保证让你爽翻天
Burst your brain, split it wide open.

36
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,987
找我就对了，朋友
I'm your man, man.

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,186
奇幻之旅都在这箱子里
Magic Mystery Tour, right here in this box.

38
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,196
这里没有的话 我可以帮你弄到
If I don't got it, I can get it.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,896
滚开
Beat it.

40
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,206
打算做对的事吗？
So you gonna do the right thing?

41
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,010
对谁是对的事，亚历？
Right for who, Alex?

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,245
你输了，迈克
You've lost, Michael,

43
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,711
都是你一手造成的
That's what you've done here.

44
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,876
你会失去更多 除非你此时此刻告诉我
You're gonna lose a whole lot more unless you tell me right here and right now...

45
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,181
你要把钱和船交给我
...you're gonna bring me the money, you're gonna bring me the boat.

46
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,087
然后你就会放我哥走
And you'll just let my brother go.

47
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,821
对
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:47,262
就像你让中间人 亚布兹和疯仔走一样
Just like you let Tweener go and Abruzzi and Haywire.

49
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,333
现在情况不同了
Things are different now.

50
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,094
-真的？ -对
- Really? - Yeah,

51
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,766
我以前效命的人 他们K算是把我卖到下游
The people I was working for, they kind of sold me down the river.

52
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,173
现在我只想出海
Now, I just wanna go out to sea.

53
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,370
真好笑 这笑话我要记起来
That's funny. I'll have to remember that one.

54
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,073
我面临的刑期比你还长
I face more prison time than you.

55
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,617
我在全民公敌名单上的 名次忽然领先了你
Sort of jumped ahead of you a few spots on the public enemy list.

56
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,115
迈克，你我是彼此 得到自由的救星
You're my way to freedom, Michael, and I'm yours.

57
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,282
我们都清楚对方的能耐
We both know what the other one's capable of,

58
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,451
不如互相尊重 不耍花招、技俩
Let's treat each other with respect here, No games, no bluffing,

59
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,097
当作是两条汉子互相帮忙
Just two guys doing each other a favor.

60
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,290
你意下如何？
What do you say?

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,237
你在哪里？
Where are you?

62
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,306
米拉佛瑞斯码头 在巴拿马市郊
Mira Flores shipping docks, just outside of Panama City.

63
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,204
是河边的一间大仓库
It's a big warehouse right on the water.

64
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,935
那可是路途遥远
That's a long ways.

65
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,137
我至少要24小时才能到
It'll take me at least 24 hours to get there.

66
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,247
那就快出发吧
Well, then, I'd get moving.

67
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,053
逃亡的感觉如何？
How's it feel being on the run?

68
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,151
-我死不了的 -被逮到你就死定了
- I'll survive. - Not if they catch you.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,125
你会被送上电椅
They'll send you to the chair.

70
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,555
你觉得很讽刺吗？
You think that's ironic?

71
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,597
那是伸张正义
It'd be justice.

72
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,291
金先生，我是亚历曼宏
Mr. Kim. Alex Mahone.

73
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,303
打电话给我
Call me.

74
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,169
正义一定会被伸张的
Oh, justice will be served.

75
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:10,007
我即将透露的讯息 极有可能让我丧命
What I'm about to divulge to you will in all likelihood get me killed.

76
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,482
-事实上，我保证活不了 -那么你为何要出面？
- Actually, I guarantee it. - Then why are you doing it?

77
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,688
因为这件事本来应该是 为了国家、忠诚
Because this was supposed to be about country, about loyalty...

78
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,258
以及做正确的事 但其实不然
...about what's right, but it wasn't.

79
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:26,194
因为我冤枉了 不该被冤枉的人
Because I wronged people who should not have been wronged.

80
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,367
这些命令都是由 卡洛琳雷诺兹下达
Those orders were given by Caroline Reynolds...

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,770
她当时是副总统
...who was vice president at the time.

82
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,879
接获命令后，我栽赃证据
Acting on those orders, I planted evidence.

83
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:46,144
我取得一具尸体 当晚我用另一场暗杀为由
I procured a body, I lured Lincoln Burrows into that parking garage that evening...

84
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,787
引诱林克柏劳到停车场
...under the auspices of a different hit.

85
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,688
我们从零开始陷害他
From the ground up, we framed him.

86
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,459
好极了
Perfect.

87
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,068
林克柏劳被处决 民众就会忘记戴伦斯史泰门
See, Lincoln Burrows gets executed, people forget about Terrence steadman...

88
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,636
还有环绕他与总统的争议
...the controversy surrounding him and the presidency.

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,968
而大众不会知道“公司”的事
And nobody ever knows about the Company.

90
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,339
对，那是个神秘的 阴谋集团
Yes, which is a shadowy cabal of corporations...

91
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:16,073
对全国大大小小的一切 都有影响力
...that pretty much influence everything that happens in this country.

92
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,741
但我看不出这件事 和莎拉丹奎迪有何关联
But I fail to see how any of this is relevant to sara Tancredi...

93
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,820
以及她协助逃犯 和弃保潜逃的事实
...and the fact that she aided and abetted, that she jumped bail.

94
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,686
她这么做是因为生命受到威胁 这合情合理
She did so because she feared for her life, which was appropriate...

95
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,827
因为我授命要杀了她
...as I had orders to kill her.

96
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,249
等等
Hey.

97
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,686
魔术生意还营业吗？
You still in the magic business?

98
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,458
-你叫什么名字？ -查可
- What's your name? - Chaco.

99
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,524
证据都在这
It's all here,

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,158
凯勒曼先生所说的一切 这些文件都可证明
Everything Mr. Kellerman said is corroborated in these documents.

101
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,135
鉴于这些证据，我想请问
In light of this evidence, my question, I guess to you...

102
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,775
你是否该花时间和资源
...is whether your time and resources are best spent...

103
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,377
继续起诉丹奎迪医生？
...in pursuing charges against Dr. Tancredi.

104
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,980
不，检方会立刻 撤销所有控告
No. My office will drop all charges effective immediately.

105
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,453
但是庭上 我想将我方的时间与焦点
But, Your Honor, I would like to devote my time and attention...

106
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,524
转移到起诉这个人 凯勒曼先生
...in prosecuting this man, Mr. Kellerman.

107
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,752
法警
Officer.

108
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,331
我真的不知该说什么
I literally don't even know what to say to you.

109
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,862
我很高兴认识你，莎拉
It was good knowing you, sara.

110
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,939
-说 -情况如何？
- Yeah? - Where are we?

111
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,675
我在巴拿马，是个好地方
I'm in Panama, Nice place,

112
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,444
天气晴朗，微风凉爽
Good weather. Cool breeze.

113
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,487
那两兄弟的情况如何？
Where are we with the brothers?

114
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,487
等你抓到他们 我要亲自过去确认
When you get them, I wanna come down there for confirmation,

115
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,094
那我建议你上飞机了
I suggest you get on a plane,

116
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,097
因为等你抵达，斯科菲尔德 和柏劳就会在你要的地方
Because by the time you get here, I'll have scofield and Burrows where you want them.

117
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,633
整件事就结束了
And then this whole thing is over.

118
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,005
莎拉，是我
Sara, it's me.

119
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,311
这感觉好奇怪
It's a strange thing...

120
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,547
留了言，却知道 对方永远不能收到
...leaving a message for someone you know is never gonna get it.

121
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,691
我只能做最坏的打算
I can only assume the worst...

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,820
所以K这是我 最后一次给你的留言
...so this'll be the last message I'll leave for you.

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,530
我只想告诉你我到了
I just wanted you to know that I made it.

124
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,071
但少了你，我开心不起来
But it's no good without you.

125
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,137
总之，你记得我说K
Anyway, remember when I?

126
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,215
记得我说 在下加利福尼亚的酒吧
Remember when I told you about those 50-cent beers...

127
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,284
畅饮时段 啤酒一瓶只要五角吗？
...in Baja at happy hour?

128
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,147
这里的酒更便宜
Well, they're even cheaper down here.

129
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,849
如果奇迹发生 你听到留言的话
And if by some miracle you do get this...

130
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,786
请你仔细听好
...I need you to listen close.

131
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,665
莎拉
Sara.

132
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,964
莎拉，我们最好离开了
Sara, I suggest we get you out of here.

133
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,402
外面会有大批媒体包围 而且只会越来越多，走吧
It's gonna be a media circus outside and it'll only get bigger. Let's go.

134
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,707
好
Sure.

135
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:36,338
今日，在丹奎迪医生案的审理 出现了更为意想不到的结果
Larger unexpected fireworks at the trial of Dr, Sara Tancredi in chicago today,

136
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,883
新的证词暗示 前总统雷诺兹
New testimony has implicated that former President Reynolds,,,

137
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,546
同谋捏造 胞弟戴伦斯史泰门之死
,,, was complicit in the falsification of her brother Terrence Steadman's death,

138
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,386
而此案的余波是 据传的凶手
The fallout from all this, the purported killer,,,

139
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,088
之前被全国性通缉的 林克柏劳
,,, Lincoln Burrows, who has led the country on a nationwide manhunt,,,

140
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,701
针对他的所有控诉 现在将立即撤销
,,, will be exonerated of all charges effective immediately,

141
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,433
天啊，布鲁斯 林克自由了
oh, my God, Bruce. Lincoln's a free man.

142
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,958
片名：越狱风云

143
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,798
剧名：巴拿马生死斗

144
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,737
迈克留言给我，天啊K

00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,095
我想我母亲 不会喜欢你这个人
I don't think my mother would have approved of you.

294
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,171
没问题，过来
Consider it done. Come on.

295
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,432
-把手铐解开 -还不行
- Uncuff me. - No, not yet.

296
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,872
现在你要反悔了吗？
So is this the part where you go back on your word?

297

手举起来K

为什么？
Why?

好问题
That's a good question.

302
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,190
你以后自己去想解答 钱在哪里？
Figure it out some day, on your own time. Where's the money?

303
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,388
-放开他 -不行
- Cut him loose. - No.

304
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,658
拜托，亚历 船已经是你的了
Come on, Alex. You already got the boat.

305
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,995
-对我有点信心 -钱

我要K
I want...

307
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,942
-说 -我到了，你在哪？

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,044
仓库里面
I'm inside the warehouse.

309
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,514
我马上到
I'll be right there.

310
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,223
好戏上场
Here we go.

311

314
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,727
-这里发生谋杀案 -你有危险吗？
- Yes. There's been a murder. - Are you in danger?

315
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,667
有两个美国人 射杀一名穿西装的亚洲男子
A well-dressed Asian man has just been shot by two Americans.

316
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,103

- We'll send a car right away, - Come. Yes, come.

317
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,335
你要杀了他，栽赃给我们
So you kill him and frame us.

318
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,873
为什么？
Why?

319
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,684
这样大家 就不会来找我麻烦
So everyone will leave me alone.

320
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,591
因为我只想要这样 还有那笔钱
Because that's all I want. That, and the money.

321
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,218
-不可能，亚历，放开他 -把钱给我
- It's not gonna happen, Alex. Let him go. - Give me the money.

322
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,365
-放开他 -把钱给我
- Let him go. - Give me the money!

323
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,780
真是不敢置信
I am dumbfounded.

324
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,760
别客气，他们是你的了
Well, don't be shy. They're all yours.

325
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,861
你说他们会在我要的地方
You said you'd have them right where we wanted them.

326
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,296
这里不是我要的地方
This isn't right where we want them.

327
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,767
那是你的工作了
Well, that's your job now.

328
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,464
我的职责结束了
This is as far as I go.

329
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,971
或是你另有目的？
Or is it something else?

330
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,271
我们都聚在这里 有其他理由吗？
Another reason we're all here?

331
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,143
例如这理由
Like that.

332
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,311
-例如黑吃黑 -正是如此，说再见吧
- Like a double-cross. - Yeah, just like that. Say goodbye.

333
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,985
英雄所见略同 可不是吗，亚历？
Great minds think alike, eh, Alex?

334
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,662
快点K
Okay, come on, come on.

335
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,038
坐下后，四肢的手铐 会固定在车地板上
Once seated, your four-piece will be mounted to the floor-mount.

336

移送过程中不得与我交谈
During transport, do not speak to either I, myself...

337
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,380

-引擎故障灯亮了 -调配场才刚检查过这台车
- The engine light just came on. - It just got serviced at motor pool.

343
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,760
对，但我们得停车确认一下
Yeah. We've gotta pull over just to make sure.

344
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,744
我去检查
All right, I'll check it out.

345
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:37,324
在法国反抗组织中 面对纳粹行刑队是种光荣
In the French Resistance, it was a high honor to face a Nazi firing squad.

346
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,658
-我不是叫你闭嘴吗？ -代表你很厉害
- Thought I told you to be quiet. - Meant you did your job.

347
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,031
当他们射死你时 面带微笑更是荣誉
The highest honor was to smile when they shot you.

348
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,606
你们早该来了
Took you long enough.

从加通湖到东运河

再到卡塔黑那，2750海里

352
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,619

两天，如果帆一直全开的话
Two days if you're under full sail all the time.

你来的时机真好 没有暴风雨，天气晴朗

这艘船是谁的？
This boat here. Who does it belong to?

358
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,836
先生？
Senor?

359
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,945
我们接到通报 这艘船从事非法毒品交易
We got a call that this boat was used in some illegal trafficking.

360
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,412
你找错船了 你可以去检查
It's the wrong boat, pal. You can check it if you want to, but, hey...

361
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,711
-你们不能就这样K -这里是巴拿马，朋友
- Hey, you can't just go to... - Hey, this is Panama, friend.

362
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,013
熟悉一下我们的法律好吗？
Get acquainted with the law, huh?

363

-你认为他被逮捕了吗？ -那艘船很显眼
- You think they got him? - It's a pretty singular boat.

368
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,809
带这么多可卡因很危险 如果是你在驾船K
That's a lot of coke to be carrying around. If you were at the helm...

369
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,250
我就会被重罚 最少十年跑不掉
I'd be doing some serious time. Ten years, minimum.

370
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,050
没错，我们失去船了

That'll work.

00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,001
-她很漂亮 -能载我们到想去的地方吧？
- She's very pretty. - She'll get us where we need to go, right?

385
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,303
我不是指船，先生
Not the boat, senor.

我得喝一杯
I need a drink.

403
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,063
我去看看有没有饮料
I'll go see what I can find.

00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,488

你们差一点就成功了
You almost did it.

410
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,849
你要钱是吗？
You want the money?

411
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,127
把钱拿走，拿去
Take the money. Take it.

412
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
你以为我要的是钱？
You think this is about the money?

413
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,000
五百万这种零用钱？
Pocket change? Like 5 million?

414
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,162
不然你想怎样？ 我哥已经被赦免无罪了
Then what is it about? My brother's been exonerated.

415
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,299
总统已经下台 我们不再是威胁，一切都结束了
The president stepped down. We're not a threat anymore. It's over.

416
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,177
你们也许和我们了结了 但我们还没结束呢
You may be done with us, but that doesn't mean we're done with you.

现代家人之间 已经很少有这种忠诚了
You don't hear that much anymore, that sort of fidelity in families.

420
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,419
两兄弟肯为彼此付出一切
Two brothers who will go to the ends of the earth for each other.

421
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,359
可惜只有一个人能活命

422
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,434

No!

423

我们快离开
We gotta go.

00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:53,120
如果你们不出来投降 我们就会开枪
My men have orders to fire if you don't come out the there with your hands first.

巴拿马领土上发生谋杀案 我们是不会宽容以待的
Murder is not something that we take lightly here on Panamanian soil.

426
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,835
出来就不会再出人命
So come on out of there and there will be no more deaths.

427
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,478
迈克，我杀了人

00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,374
现在别去想这件事
Don't think about that now.

429
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,881
你和我还有约会，记得吗？
You and I have got a date, remember?

430

两杯莱姆汁和啤酒，别忘了

432
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,713
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

433

我杀死一个人
I took a man's life.

434

我们一起走出去 告诉他们事发过程
We're gonna walk out of here together and we'll tell them exactly what happened.

435
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,633
看着我K
No, look at me, look at me, look at me.

436
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,572
我们告诉他们事发经过
Now, we're gonna tell them what happened.

437
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,577
-好 -我们把一切解释清楚
