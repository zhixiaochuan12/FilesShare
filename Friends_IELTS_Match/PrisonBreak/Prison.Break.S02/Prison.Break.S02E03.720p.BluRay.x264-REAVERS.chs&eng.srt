00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,145
需要逃到远处，就会偷车 需要钱，就会去抢劫商店
Needing distance, he'll steal a car. Needing money, he'll rob a store.

49
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,846
需要帮助 就会信任不该信任的人
Needing help, he'll trust someone that he shouldn't.

50
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,689
而当他犯错时
And when he does...

51
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,492
就会留下线索，引导我们找到他

没有大碍的，我们继续逃
It's fine, man. Let's just keep moving.

继续逃的话 你的腿会继续流血
We keep moving and that leg keeps bleeding.

63
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,271
你的腿不止血 我们就逃不出伊利诺州
That leg keeps bleeding and we're not getting out of Illinois.

64
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,274
这会很痛
This is gonna hurt.

65
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,907
很好K
That's good, that's good, that's good.

66
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,817
这可以让微血管闭合
This will seal the capillaries.

67
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,411
麦可，你不能来这里
You should not have come here.

68
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,523
警察已经来问过我
The police have been here asking questions.

00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,953
我们别无选择

It wasn't part of our deal. I know, I know. I'm sorry.

对不起 我们没有其他地方可去

我看到新闻的时候，我很担心
When I saw you on the news, I was worried.

我那能希望你们已经跨越边境了
I just hoped you'd crossed the border by now.

75

别管那辆车子，我们再找一辆
Forget the car. We can get another.

80
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,625
不能随便一辆车 我需要那辆车

81

为什么？
Why?

82

因为车上有帮助我们 消失的一切
Because in that car is everything we need to disappear.

83
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,904
-有何发现？ -这里，老大

警察几小时前 抓到一个流浪汉
One of the blues hauled in a vagrant a couple of hours ago.

85
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,281
看来他身上有些东西
It seems the man was in possession of an item or two...

86
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,680
是偷来的
...that didn't exactly belong to him.

87

看来我们找到第一个错误了
Looks like we got our first mistake.

88

我看看
Let me check.

96
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,821
顺便帮我拿一瓶威士忌，小弟
And get me a bottle of that Early Times while you're back there, junior.

How goes it, Roy?

99
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,250
说真的，罗伊 你大可不必踢我跨下
To be honest, Roy, I could've done without the knee to the junk.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,878
你咬了我，布拉德 像个小女孩一样
You bit me, Brad. Like a little girl, you bit me.

101
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,890
-那是你应得的 -大概是吧
- Well, you had it coming. - Yeah, probably did.

102
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,526
真是荒唐 我们为了事情的结果互相怪罪
You know, it's crazy, us taking it out on each other for how things turned out.

103
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,861
你想怪罪人的话 何不怪那些每天早上
You want someone to blame, how about those convicts staring up at us...

104
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,128
从报纸里盯着我们的罪犯？
...from the papers every morning?

105
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:23,537
他们害我丢掉工作、退休金、尊严
They took my job, my pension, my dignity.

106
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,940
他们翻墙出去时 那些都被他们一并带走了
When they went over that wall, they took all of it right along with them.

107
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,547
我一生辛苦的成果
Everything I worked for my whole life.

108
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,382
你有看到逮捕他们的赏金吗？
You see that reward they got?

109
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,453
那些浑蛋死了 都比你我活着要值钱
Those ass-hats are worth more dead than you and I are alive.

110
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,447
-维持不了多久的 -什么意思？
- Not for long. - What do you mean?

111
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,116
有人一定会拿到赏金 还不如由我来拿
I mean somebody's gonna get that money. Might as well be me.

112
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,059
你知道，这种工作
You know, a job like that...

113
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,030
如果多个帮手会顺利许多
...might go a little smoother with an extra pair of hands.

114
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,602
你真以为我会和你平分赏金？
You really think I'm gonna split that reward with you?

115
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,332
我是指等你找到那对兄弟 他们人多势众
I'm just saying, you run into those brothers, two of them, one of you...

116
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,999
到时你会需要帮手在一旁
...you might find yourself wishing for a good wingman.

117
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,155
快完成，麦可
Just get it done, Mike.

118
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,124
-你好吗？ -我能效劳吗？
- How you doing? - Can I help you?

119
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,732
希望可以，查克
Yeah, I hope so, Chuck.

120
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,735
你们拖走我的车了
I think you may have towed my car.

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,496
-什么样的车？ -什么样的车？
- What'd it look like? - What did it look like?

122
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,737
你偷背包的车子 长的是什么样子？
The car you stole the backpack from, what did it look like?

123
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,778
不知道，也许是灰色的吧
I don't know, man. Maybe it was gray.

124
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,814
-灰色本田雅哥 -车牌呢？
- It's a gray Accord. - License number?

125
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,679
听着，我只知道这些
Look, man, that's all I know.

126
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,786
我要偷的不是车
I wasn't after the car.

127
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:46,015
-我以为背包里面有衣服 -你记得车子停在哪里吗？
- I thought the bag had some clothes in it. - You remember where the car was parked?

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,819
你停在哪里？
Where'd you park it?

129
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,359
汉卡街和15街路口
Corner of Hancock and 15th.

130
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,589
不知道，也许在15街附近
I don't know, maybe around 15th somewhere.

131
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,791
-可是车子不会在那里 -什么意思？
- But it ain't gonna be there anymore. - What do you mean?

132
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,732
那就是我为何 没有偷其他东西的原因
That's the reason I didn't get to grab anything else.

133
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,635
-拖吊车刚好过来 -我已经在查了

136
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,658

137
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,025
应该几分钟就好
Shouldn't take but a few minutes.

138
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,603
（俄亥俄州，迪法恩斯）

139
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,039

142
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,516
但是我朋友苏克 不会打电话给我

00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,279
他们打算要去哪里？
...once they went over that wall?

285
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,220
没错
That's right.

286
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,164
我也许已经不是狱警，小胖
I may not work here anymore, big-uns...

287
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,863
但我对他们还是有点影响力
...but I still got influence with people who do.

288
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:37,168
只要我要求，他们就会做到 要修理谁都可以
People who will do whatever I ask them to, to whoever I ask them to.

289
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,448
像你这种丰满的男人
And a curvy man like yourself...

290
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,910
我想一定有些心理不正常的人
Let's just say there's some filthy individuals...

291
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:54,320
会喜欢和女人相似的狱友
...who might enjoy a cellie with womanly attributes.

292
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,963
你现在就把 知道的一切都告诉我
Now, you're gonna tell me everything you know...

293
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,464
告诉我这些逃犯打算逃亡到哪里
...about where those convicts are headed...

294
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,294
否则我就把你 这只肥羊丢入虎口
...or I'm gonna throw your fat ass to the wolves.

295
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,474
好，谢谢
Okay, thanks.

296
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,875
出现第三个错误
Mistake number three.

297
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,577
有人通报说看见疑似 费南多苏克的人偷车
Someone reported seeing a man matching Fernando sucre's description stealing a car.

298
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:26,281
-在哪里？ -俄亥俄州迪法恩斯
- Where? - Defiance, ohio.

299
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,693
今天一定有人会被逮捕
Someone's going down today.

300
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,670
修女，我知道K
I know, mami, I know.

301
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,207
莎拉
Sara.

302
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,682
-我帮你付了保释金 -还真花了你不少时间
- I paid your bail. - You took your time.

303
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,914
-我是州长，我有事要忙K -去死吧，爸
- I'm the governor. I do have things that... - Go to hell, Dad.

304
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,388
你的态度再如此恶劣 也许以后我只能在这见到你
You keep this up, this may be the only place I'll be able to see you.

305
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,826
你有想要听我的说辞吗？
Do you even wanna hear my side of things?

306
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,193
莎拉，我没有很想
Not particularly, sara, no.

307
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,463
尤其是当我 根本不清楚你站在哪一方时
Especially when I have no idea whose side you're on.

308
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,401
但有一点我很清楚
But I do know this.

309
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,838
福克斯河越狱事件 有人一定要负责
Somebody is gonna go down because of what happened at Fox River.

310
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,437
如果那个人不是你
And it would be in both of our best interests...

311
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,204
对我们俩都最好
...if that someone was not you.

312
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,979
但为了确保这种结果 必须采取一定步骤
But to ensure this, certain steps need to be taken.

313
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,142
第一，  你得参加每日戒毒会
One, you should go to a daily recovery meeting.

314
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,619
第二，你必须对法官宣称无罪
Two, you need to go before a judge and plead not guilty.

315
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,280
-第三K -我不行K
- And three... - Dad, I don't...

316
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,790
你必须把实情 一五一十告诉矫正局
You need to tell the DoC everything you know...

317
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,054
说出监狱是如何管理的
...about how that prison was being run.

318
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,358
波普典狱长 让史柯菲享有特权
And that Warden Pope, how he was granting favors to scofield...

319
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,093
因为史柯菲私底下帮他忙
...because scofield helped him with his personal projects.

320
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,533
因此让他有机会 进入某些禁区
Thereby exposing him to certain restricted areas...

321
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,902
让他有办法取得医务室的钥匙
...where he may have been able to obtain a key to the infirmary.

322
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,171
我办不到
I can't do that.

323
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,508
莎拉，你当然办得到 你会这么说的
Oh, yes, you can, sara. You can do that and you will.

324
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,647
是我做的，爸
I did it, Dad.

325
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,286
我刻意没锁门，是我一个人做的
I left the door open. Me, and no one else.

326
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,389
这不是真的
That's not true.

327
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,686
-是真的 -不是真的
- Yes, it is. - That's not true.

328
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,094
莎拉
Sara...

329
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,701
照我的话去做
...just do what you're told.

330
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:24,104
否则后果会影响到我们俩
Otherwise, there will be consequences that will affect us all.

331
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,745
你懂我的意思吗？
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

332
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,704
懂，先生
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,913
很好
Good.

334
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,350
在一周后
In one week...

335
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,854
我会被指派 成为新任的美国副总统
...I will be appointed the new vice president of the United states.

336
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,050
我们会举行典礼，他们会邀请你
There will be a ceremony, you will be invited.

337
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,788
但是你不要参加
You will not attend.

338
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,290
再见，莎拉
Goodbye, sara.

339
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,281
-放音乐来听 -不要碰
- Let's put some music on. - No.

340
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,117
我忘了，不能开收音机
Forgot. No radio.

341
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,451
外面真是安静
Man, it's quiet out here.

342
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,388
监狱里到处都是噪音
Inside, there was always noise, you know.

343
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,121
喊叫声、狱警巡察声 我已经习惯了
Someone yelling, guards making rounds. Kind of got used to it.

344
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,130
说得对，还是回监狱好了
You're right. We should go back.

345
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,939
你的刺青 不只是用来越狱的吧？
The tats. They weren't just for getting out, were they?

346
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:35,578
逃出来只是开端 现在将会更有趣
Breaking out was just the beginning. Now it gets a little more interesting.

347
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,046
因为我被绑在电椅上 还不够有趣？
Because me being strapped to the electric chair wasn't interesting enough.

348
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,482
我只是说 在监狱里有意外的惊喜
All I'm saying, is inside, we had the element of surprise.

349
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,020
没有人知道我们的计划
No one knew what we were planning.

350
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,855
可是电梯里的那个特务 感觉不简单
But there's something about this guy, the one in the elevator.

351
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,024
就像是K
It's like...

352
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,724
他知道我们要去哪 看穿我们的心思
It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking,

353
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,360
如果是真的，他早晚 会知道犹他州的钱
It's a matter of time before he finds out about the money in Utah,,,

354
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,973
波修伊布斯 我们逃到墨西哥的通道
,,, Bolshoi Booze, our way into Mexico,

355
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,204
他全都会知道

他提到见面的事
Something about a meeting.

367
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,586
他好像在等某人去听留言 然后回电给他
Sounded like he's waiting for someone else to check the message, call him back.

368
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,422
这号码的开头，是手机号码 只要手机开着
This prefix, it's a cell phone number. As long as it's on...

369
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,361
就能追踪到他的位置
We can track exactly where he is.

370
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,687
不要做傻事K
Don't do anything stupid, don't do anything stupid.

371
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,646
有问题吗，警官？
Is there a problem, officer?

372
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,690
你知道我拦你下来的原因吗？
You know why I pulled you over today, sir?

373
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,690
超速？
Speeding?

374
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,797
麻烦给我看你的驾照和行照
Let me see your license and registration, please.

375
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:10,593
问题是我的皮夹不见了
The thing is, I lost my wallet.

376
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,869
那给我看行照就好
Well, I guess your registration will have to do just fine.

377

他招供了吗？
Did he sing?

383
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,630
什么都说了
Like a fat, sweaty bird.

384
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,976
小宝贝
Hey, sweet pea.

385
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,672

帮我个忙，去拿一枝粉笔

Sort of, I guess.

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,805
那就好，很好

天啊，我真高兴见到你，宝贝
Oh, God, it's so good to see you, baby girl.

394
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,651
你知道爸爸现在的情况吗？
Do you understand what Daddy is going through right now?

395
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,687
大概知道 可是学校同学在说你的坏话
Sort of. But the kids at school have been saying stuff.

396
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,948

397
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,720
他们说因为你是坏人 才会上电视
They're saying you're on TV because you're a bad man.

398
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,262
那你怎么想？
And what do you think?

399
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,902
如果我被关在一个地方
I think if I were some place...

400
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,471
他们不让我离开去找你
...and they wouldn't let me leave to see you...

401
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,369
我也不会乖乖听他们的话
...I wouldn't do what they said either.

402
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,441
你知道吗？
You know what?

00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,402
就要在七点把门廊的灯打开

蒂蒂，不要太靠近栅栏

416
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,964
那里
There.

417
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,004
就快到了
It's not much further now.

418
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,717
好，他们下了州际公路 开上38号公路往北走
Okay, they've moved off the interstate, heading north on Route 38.

419
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,520
请说
Talk to me.

420
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,394
哪里？
Where? There's a patrolman who thinks...

421
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,659
宝州拉特罗布有个巡警 认为他拦下了费南多苏克
...he has Fernando sucre pulled over outside of Latrobe, Pennsylvania.

422
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,631
通知当地警局
Get in touch with the local dispatch.

423
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,739
说清楚我们要活捉，不要死捉
Make it clear that we want this man in custody, not in a body bag.

424
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:13,543
死人没办法透露 同伙在哪里，没错
Yeah, dead men can't tell us where their friends are. You got it.

425
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,721
-你确定是他吗？ -一定是，和照片一样
- Do you have a positive ID? - It's gotta be. It looks just like him.

This is the one.

435
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,813
-有看见他吗？ -没有，也许他没听到留言
- You see him? - Nope. Maybe he didn't get your message.

436
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,188
他们停下来了
They've stopped.

437
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,294
就在前面几里处，那里K
A couple of miles up ahead. There's...

438
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,859
那里什么也没有 他们在等什么？

当然
Of course.

446
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,705
要怎么做猎人才不会找足迹？
How do you throw the hunter off the scent?

447
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,142
除掉他的猎物
Get rid of the prey.

记住，我一按下“搜寻”按钮 30秒后它就会到103点7兆赫
Remember, once I hit scan, we'll have about 30 seconds before it reaches 103.7.

449
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:16,984

Then she blows.

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,729
不知道，可是一定得爆炸才行
I don't know, but we're gonna need that explosion.

他来了
He's here.

00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,565
他来了
He's here.

459
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,839
收音机一定坏掉了 我们得亲自引爆炸弹
The radio must've jammed. We're gonna have to set it off manually.

那辆车随时可能会爆炸
The car could blow any second, Mike.

调查局员再过两分钟就到了

最好祈祷电台收得到

Way out here? Just one, probably.

468
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,057
（纽约州，贝德福德斯图威桑特）

469
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,493

我已经72小时没有麦眼
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

我眼见一个人的手被砍断
I've seen a man's hand get chopped off...

我被警察开枪、挖坟墓、偷车 跳上一台该死的火车
...I've been shot at, dug up a grave, stolen a car, jumped on a freaking train.

我会告诉他们 我能了解他们的感受

497
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,605
因为我曾经跟他们一样

00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,076
我曾经有过毒瘾

这么辛苦计划，再逃出监狱

不可能每个都抓到，对吧？

现在前往犹他州的路没有阻碍了

他们会把注意力转到其他人身上

他们会有一阵子 不去注意我们

他们还是会检查 意外的鉴识报告
