你要她弃保潜逃？

你该庆幸你不在我面前 不然我会掐死你
Be glad you ain't in front of my face, I'd have my hands around your neck.

00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,533
他以前在阿拉斯加的 养鱼场工作

362
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,630
-不过问你的过去 -阿拉斯加？

对，阿拉斯加 当地人不会多管闲事
Yeah, Alaska, man, They don't bother you up there, man,

364

369
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,154
-喂？ -带史泰门到第二个地点

370
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,554
我们正派车要去接他
We're sending a car.

371
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,521
车已经来了，长官
It's already here, sir.

372
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,388

把武器放在地上，动作快！
Put your weapons down on the ground. Now.

380
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,128
戴伦斯，走开 上车去

381
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,326
你这死人看起来真健康

382
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,126
-上车！ -等等K
- Get in the car. - Wait, wait, wait.

383

杀死史泰门 杀死所有人，快点！

-保罗，拜托K不要杀我 -上车！快点！

387
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,516
我们走
Let's go.

388
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,230
麻醉后最难受的 副作用是呕吐
Vomiting. It's the worst side effect of anesthesia.

389
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,605
你应该不会再吐了
That should be the last of it.

390
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,506
-你认为我把食物都吐光了？ -对

391
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,386
潘

亚历，卡麦隆受伤了

他人在医院，腿有两处骨折

395
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,031
我马上搭机到科罗拉多

396
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,862
-他正在动手术 -我马上到，你等我
- He's in surgery now, - I'll be right there. Just hold on.

397
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,163
他们不让我见他！ 他们打给我
They won't let me seem him. They called me.

398
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,534
我马上过来 可是他们不让我见他
I got right here and they won't let me see him.

399
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,144
潘，拜托，在我到之前先冷静点 帮我这个忙好吗？
Pam, please, just keep it together until I get there. Can you do that for me?

400
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,336
拜托，快来
Please. Please hurry.

401
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,645
曼宏先生 你不能搭飞机
Mr. Mahone, you cannot get on a plane.

402
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,376
你至少要住院一天观察
You need to stay at least another day for observation.

403
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,814
你中枪了
You've been shot.

404
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,046
曼宏先生，拜托
Mr. Mahone, please.

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,515
-我得见我儿子 -曼宏先生，我了解
- I've gotta go see my son. - Mr. Mahone, I understand.

拜托，至少先找医生谈谈吧？
Please. At least stay and talk to a doctor.

407
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,553
计程车！计程车！
Taxi. Taxi.

408
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,027
你儿子好吗？
How's your boy?

409
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,039
胫骨腓骨断裂很严重
Tib-fib fractures are bad.

410
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,643
但如果生长板受到影响 之后的问题就更多了
But if the growth plate's affected there's a whole host of problems.

411
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,339
-你做错事了 -不，是你错了
- You made a mistake. - No, you did.

412

你当我们是邮局 说不干就不干？
You think you can just quit like you work at a post office?

413
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,211
回到工作岗位上
Now, you're needed back in.

414
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,580
收拾你的烂摊子
Go clean up your mess.

415
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:39,986
科罗拉多州杜兰戈的街上 也许就不会再出意外了
Maybe there won't be another accident on the streets of Durango, Colorado.

416
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,261
懂了吗？
Understand?

417
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,796
封锁每条路 拦下每台车搜查
Every road shut down. Every car searched.

418
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,409
就算是到黄石公园观光的 一车修女也不能放过
I don't care if it's a group of nuns. Their camper gets turned inside out.

419
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,773
-以规模来说，每条路都查的话K -那是蒙大拿
- Logistically speaking, every road's gonna... - It's Montana.

420
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,641
不是曼哈顿
Not Manhattan.

421
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,610
-去办 -是，长官
- Get it done. - Yes, sir.

422
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,721
如果有照相机，可以拍下 他拿今天报纸的照片
If we get a camera, we can take a picture of him holding a newspaper.

423
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,123
照片放上网路 就可证明他还活着
If we put that online, that'll prove he's alive.

424
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:21,231
这只能证明我们找到 一个有点像总统弟弟的人
It'll prove that we found a guy that looks kind of like the president's brother.

425
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,890
-指纹、牙医纪录 -我们湮灭掉一切档案
- Fingerprints. Dental records. - We whitewashed him.

426
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,537
拔掉他的牙齿 烧掉他的指纹
We pulled his teeth, burned off his fingerprints.

427
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,694
DNA
DNA.

428
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,501
拿来比对我们杀死 放在他车上的游民
To compare against the homeless guy we killed and put in steadman's car.

429
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,769
但所有外在DNA样本都已摧毁
But we destroyed all exterior DNA samples...

430
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,345
所以也没有样本可供比对
...so that there'd be nothing to compare them to.

431
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,277
世界上一定有人 可以指认这个人
There's gotta be someone somewhere who can identify this man.

432
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,009
所以我们替他动手术
Which is why we did the surgery.

433
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:44,622
颧骨提高两公分 耳朵往下拉四分之一寸
Cheekbones raised two centimeters, ears lowered a quarter of an inch.

434
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,121
认识他的人 虽然可以认出他来
Not so much that someone wouldn't recognize him...

435
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,523
但足够让鉴识比对结果 判定照片上的人
...but enough that any forensic comparison of a photograph of that man...

436
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,720
只是长相类似的人
...would conclude that he is a look-alike.

437
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,922
一场骗局 相信我
A hoax. Trust me.

438
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,625
我们办事能力非常高超
We are very good at what we do.

439
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,172
拜托，放我走
Please, just let me go.

440
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,367
戴伦斯，你害这里每一个人 变成囚犯，包括你自己
Terrence, you made every man in this room a prisoner, including yourself.

441
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,770
-你该还我们自由了 -无论如何都不可能
- It's time to set us free. - Nothing you do will work.

442
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,578
-他们不会放过K -别再装无辜了，戴伦斯
- They will not let it... - Cut the victim act, Terrence.

443
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,313
当他借由生田公司 侵占纳税人的血汗钱时
He's happy to play along when he was lining his pockets...

444
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,219
他很乐意合作，之后K
...with taxpayer money funneled through EcoField. And then...

445
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,518
当事情快要暴露时K
...when the indictment is about to fall...

446
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,889
你跑去找谁帮忙，戴伦斯？
...who do you come running to for help, Terrence?

447
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,133
我们在这里住一、两天 直到他们以为我们已经走远了
We're gonna stay here for a day or two until they think we're thousand miles away.

448
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,502
然后我们就前往华盛顿特区
And then we're gonna make our way to D.C.

449
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,138
好吗？
Okay?

450
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,836
这是你的计划？带他去“公司” 和调查局的大本营？
So that's the plan? We take him to a city crawling with Company and Feds?

451
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,349
还有从里头与你父亲里应外合 依然当权的政府官员
And government agents still in power working from the inside with your father.

452
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,648
他们有办法让这浑蛋 在最有利的状况下说出实情
People who can get that pain in the ass to safely tell his story on the record.

453
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,281
直捣虎穴是吗？ 祈祷我们不会被吃掉
We just stroll right into the lion's den then, huh? Pray we don't get mauled.

454
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,152
我看他们不会来蒙大拿 所以我们要去找他们
I don't think they're gonna come to Montana, so we're gonna go to them.

455
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,365
不，放开她
No, Leave her alone,

456
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:07,631
-你想对她做什么？ -我只要跟她交往
- What do you want with her? - What I want is to date her,

457
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,768
抓她做什么K
What do you want,,,?

458
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,643
-我再去做点爆米花 -亲爱的
- I'll make you some more popcorn. - Honey.

459
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,874
如果我们还吃得下爆米花 我会很惊讶
If any of us could eat any more corn, I'd be amazed.

460
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,347
你懂吗，葛蕾西？
See what I did there, Gracey?

461
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:24,955
印地安语的玉米 和惊讶一字同音
Indian word for corn is "maize," and I just said, "amazed."

462
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,854
我听不懂，我被搞混了
I don't get it. I'm corn-fused.

463
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,492
你真是精明
You are smarter than a bee sting.

464
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,224
美国第二位女总统 就在这里K
The second female president of these United states, right here...

465
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,459
和我们一起看电视
...watching TV with us.

466
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,870
瞧我真笨拙
Look what I did.

467
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,231
-甜心，没关系 -不，我去拿抹布
- Honey, that's all right. - No, I'll get a rag.

468
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,774
不用，我可以K
No, I can...

469
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,247
我以为我们要重新开始
I thought we had wiped the slate clean.

470
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,846
求求你
Please.

471
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,755
我以为我们已经既往不咎
I thought we had put the past where it belonged.

472
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:06,090
的确，过去的事我不在乎了
We did. We did put the past where it belonged.

473
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,263
别骗我，女人
Do not lie to me, woman.

474
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,664
你向警方举发我K
After turn coating me to the authorities...

475
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,430
亏我们如此幸福 你重重敲碎我的心
...and everything we had. After breaking my heart into so many pieces...

476
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,805
让我永远无法恢复之后 你至少可以帮我个忙
...that I will never be able to find them all you can at least do me the favor...

477
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,674
不要当着我的面说谎！
...as to not stand there and lie to my face.

478
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,314
妈？
Mom?

479
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,773
柴克，回到沙发上坐好！
Zack, you get your ass back on that couch.

480
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,412
带葛蕾西逃出去！
Get Gracey. Go.

481
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,146
把枪给我！
Give that to me.

482
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,824
我已经给你们一次机会了
I gave you all a chance.

483
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,759
不要忘了
Remember that.

484
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,023
打开二十二号牢房
Open up 22.

485
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,360
二十二号牢房开了
Opening 22.

486
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,399
老兄，你真的疯了
Dude, you're crazy.

487
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,302
其他犯人也这么认为？
Is that what the other cons are saying?

488
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,170
-对 -很好
- Yeah. - Good.

489
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,802
你竟然敢惹班克斯 他不是你惹得起的对象
But you took it to Banks. I don't think you wanna be messing with him, man.

490
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,417
想找我麻烦的人我都敢惹
I'll mess with anybody tries to punk me out.

491
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,347
你知道我只是在测试你
Hey, you know, I've just been testing you.

492
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,389
好，测试结果出炉了
Yeah, well, the test results came back...

493
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,355
我要睡上铺
...and top bunk's mine now.

494
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,654
你有意见吗？
You got a problem with that?

495
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,707
-有事吗，史托特？ -布拉德，你这次死定了
- Hey, what's up, stolte? - You just screwed up, Brad. Big time.

496
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,936
不，我要让大家见识我的能耐 现在大家知道了
No. I had a message to send and that message got delivered.

497
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,513
你揍的人，班克斯
The guy you schlocked, Banks.

498
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,174
他和晚班狱警交情匪浅
He's got connections with the guards working nights.

499
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,756
有消息说今晚 班克斯会把你抓出牢房
Word is, Banks is gonna have you pulled out of your cell tonight.

500
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,250
-你没办法帮我吗？ -可以
- Well, can't you do nothing? - Yeah.

501
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,224
我可以警告你 所以我来了
I can warn you which is what I'm doing.

502
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,660
你不能找晚班的人谈谈吗？
Can't you talk to some of the guys working nights?

503
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,426
就是你分配他们 当晚班狱警的
They're working nights because you put them on nights.

504
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,501
你早该对他们好一点
You should've treated them better.

505
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,399
他们不可能帮你的，布拉德
They ain't gonna do you any favors.

506
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,006
我对你很好，不是吗？
Well, I treated you right, didn't I?

507
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,732
拜托，史托特
Come on, stolte.

508
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,139
你不能想想办法吗？拜托
Can't you do something? Please.

509
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,212
你的确对我很好
You did treat me right...

510
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,542
但现在我无能为力
...but there is nothing I can do now...

511
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,616
我只能警告你
...except warn you...

512
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,844
提高警觉
...watch your back.

513
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,098
我们可以用冰川国家公园 公园管理员走的防火道
We can use the roads that the rangers use in Glacier National Park.

514
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,634
晚上他们不会巡逻，我们进入 加拿大往东走，穿越纽约州
They don't patrol them at night. Get up into Canada, head east. Cut through New York.

515
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:03,035
-通过边境不成问题 -不会有人料到我们在那里
And the borders won't be a problem. No, nobody'll look for us there.

516
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,732
-你觉得很好笑吗，戴伦斯？ -不，不好笑
- This fun for you, Terrence? Really? - No, this isn't fun.

517
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,573
好笑的是当 卡洛琳和我聊到你
What was fun was when Caroline and I would talk about you...

518
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,542
还有你暗恋她的事
...and the schoolboy crush that you had on her.

519
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,374
他向她求过婚
He proposed to her.

520
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:21,716
你真以为你可以当第一丈夫？ 奴隶想当国王？
You actually thought that you would be the first husband? Serf who would be king?

521
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,417
卡洛琳
Caroline.

522
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,317
我们快笑死了K
We laughed so hard...

523
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,398
你眼睁睁看着他们 杀死哩诺卡
You stood and watched them kill Veronica.

524
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,558
-柏劳！ -你什么也没做！
- Burrows. - And you did nothing.

525
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,465
-柏劳 -都是你害死她的！
- Burrows. - She died because of you.

526
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,213
-林克 -闭嘴！
- Linc... - shut up.

527
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,946
柏劳，他死掉对我们没好处 他没有身份
Burrows, he has no value to us dead. He has no identity.

528
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,610
-杀了他，他只是具无名尸 -把枪放下
- Kill him, he's just a John Doe. - Put your gun down.

529
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,018
-他先放下 -林克，我们就差这么一点
- When he puts his down. - Linc, we're so close.

530
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:57,158
值得吗？害死那些人？ 毁了我的人生？
Was it worth it? Killing those people? Ruining my life?

531
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,126
-快搞定你哥 -闭嘴，别帮倒忙，别帮倒忙
- Get a handle on your brother. - Shut up. You're not helping.

532
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,925
林克，不要这么做
Linc, you don't want to do this.

533
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,567
相信我
Trust me.

534
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,133
这不是你要的结果
This isn't what you want.

535
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,197
你不会想这么做 懂吗？相信我
You don't want to do this, okay? Trust me.

536
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,750
死了这么多人
So many people dead.

537
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,122
他却能活下来
And he gets to live.

538
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,969
喂？喂？
Hello? Hello?

539
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,563
法院拒绝保释
They denied bail.

540
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,340
-什么？ -法官不相信都是你在策划
- What? - The judge didn't buy that it was all you.

541
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,170
凯西要被正式起诉了
Kacee's going into the system now.

542
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,177
帮助逃犯的罪名 她的刑期可长了
Aiding an escaped con. She's looking at major time, man.

543
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:04,525
我要你告诉她的律师 你听好，告诉她的律师K
Now, I want you to tell her lawyer, all right, you listen to me. You tell her lawyer...

544
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,789
我爱你
I love you,

545
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,101
-告诉她的律师我会自首 -不行
...tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in, okay? - No,

546
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,601
凯西要你继续逃
Kacee says you need to run.

547
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,569
如果你被逮捕或是自首 蒂蒂会失去双亲
If you turn yourself in, Dede won't have either of you.

548
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,102
她会被送去寄养家庭
And they'll just throw her into foster care,

549
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,039
听着，我现在要挂电话了
Look, I'm gonna hang up this phone right now,,,

550
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,340
我怕我会说出令自己后悔的话
...because I might say something I'll regret.

551
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,641
拜托K
Yo...

552
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,013
你好好照顾蒂蒂就是了
You just take care of Dede.

553
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,227
柴克，你知道吗？
You know, Zack...

554
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,528
我的成长期间没有父亲陪伴
...my daddy wasn't really in the picture much when I was growing up.

555
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,807
所以我一直没有学会 木工的技巧
As a result, I never really learned the art of carpentry.

556
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,675
但我想耶稣是木工 他小时候也没有父亲教导他
But I figure Jesus was a carpenter, and his daddy wasn't around to teach him...

557
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,643
于是我自学
...so I taught myself.

558
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:03,210
一段时间后 我拿铁捶东敲西打很拿手
Over time, I got to be a pretty good swinger of the hammer.

559
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,816
好消息是K
Now, the good news is...

560
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,894
不像我父亲或万能的天神 我会永远K
...unlike my papa and the Great Almighty, I am here...

561
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,621
陪在你身旁
...for good.

562
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,624
千万不要质疑我的话
Don't make no mistake about it.

563
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,234
我们将是一家人
We will be a family...

564
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,934
就算同归于尽也无妨
...if it kills us.

565
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,452
好甜蜜
It's so sweet.

566
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,465
车子停在外面 准备动身吧
Car's out front. Let's move out.

567
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,631
他们不可能坐同一辆车的
These two will never make it in a car together.

568
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,299
-你得管好你哥哥 -你不了解他
- You keep your brother in check. - You don't know him.

569
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,505
那就把他的枪拿走 没时间瞎混了
Then get my gun from him. We don't have time for this.

570
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,979
你还认为操控权 在你手上，是吗？
You still think you're running this show, don't you?

571
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,947
到现在你还不承认吗？
You still think I'm not?

572
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,791
是，我要查 第十一台新闻部的电话
Yes, I'd like the number for Channel 11 News, please.

573
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,125
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

574
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,058
这不在计划之中，挂掉
This is not the plan. Hang up.

575
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,429
好，接过去，我等
Yes, connect me. I'll hold.

576
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,401
你打给新闻台 他们就会报警
Scofield, you call the news, they call the cops.

577
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,901
好，接过去
