00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,736
我会尽全力救你出来
I'm gonna do everything I can to get you out.

285
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,174
尼克
Hey, Nick.

286
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,212
如果你遇到我爸
If you talk to my dad...

287
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,907
告诉他不管发生什么事 我都爱他
,,, tell him no matter what, I love him,

288
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,956
-你好 -你好
- Hey. - Hey.

289
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:12,255
-告诉他了吗？ -行动吧
- Did you get him? - Let's do this.

290
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,690
我们还得去一个地方
We got one more stop.

291
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,139
我的信仰中有个观念 我相当确信
There is a belief in my religion which I know to be true...

292
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,408
不论是否为印度教徒 人人都适用
...and it applies to everyone, Hindu or not.

293
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:37,711
人此生的行为会影响下辈子
The acts we commit in this life determine where we go in the next.

294
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:42,087
犯下恶行的人 将永世无法得到幸福
And he who commits evil can never hope for eternal happiness.

295
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,528
那不是我的目标，医生
Never been a goal of mine, doc.

296
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,097
我比较关心现在的人生
I'm more a here-and-now type.

297
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,430
我告诉你一件我确信的事
I'll tell you something I know is true.

298
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,974
本国拿战斧的印地安人K
The Indians here, the tomahawk variety...

299
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,371
有些人相信K
...some of them believe...

300
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,741
应该说曾经相信 因为他们都死光了
Well, used to believe, before most of them were slaughtered.

301
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:08,716
当战士在战场上 杀死另一个战士
- That when a warrior kills another in battle...

302
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:14,223
他会吸取死去战士的灵魂
...he absorbs that fallen warrior's spirit.

303
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,728
所以这不是 你生命的尽头，医生
So this isn't the end for you, doc.

304
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,000
你会与我同在

我们可以从这里走路去法院
We can make it to the courthouse on foot.

318
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,946
你不懂，所有东西都在车上
You don't understand. Everything is in that car.

319
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,248
别管车子，我们没时间了
Forget the damn car. We don't have time.

320
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,890
我们快走吧
Come on, man, let's go.

如果你们 从一开始说清楚的话
...that this was gonna be a railroad.

337
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,208
-就这样了 -这次越狱事件只能归咎一个人
- That'll be all. - There is only one person responsible...

338
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,547
他叫做麦可史柯菲
...for this escape. His name is Michael scofield.

339
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,815
错不在贝里克狱警或我身上！
It's not officer Bellick. It's not me!

340
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,824
如果你们要代罪羔羊 没关系
But you need a fall guy, fine.

341
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,724
但是我不会 只让贝里克丢掉工作
But you're not gonna be just taking officer Bellick's job.

342
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,559
即使他的许多行为 让我颜面尽失
Because even though I am not proud of many of his actions...

343
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,369
但如果我不照顾我的下属 我就未免太冷血无情了

00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,036
我救不了他
I failed him.

460
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,713

Which means they either come to us or they die.
