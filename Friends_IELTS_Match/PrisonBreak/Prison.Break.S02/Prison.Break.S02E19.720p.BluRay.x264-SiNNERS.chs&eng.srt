-她会想听我要说的话 -我高度怀疑这点
- She'll want to hear what I have to say. - Oh, I highly doubt that.

146
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,305
你唯一能见的人
The only person you get to talk to...

147
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,600
只有我
...is me.

148
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,639
如果你下一个小时还想活命
And the only way you're gonna live through the next hour...

149
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,939
就告诉我你哥在哪里
...is if you tell me where to find your brother.

150
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,748
好
Okay.

151
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,155
-他在安全的地方 -具体一点
- He's in a safe place. - Be more specific.

152
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,957
具体上而言
Specifically...

153
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,320
就是你永远找不到的地方
...a place you will never find him.

154
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,107
我很荣幸
I had the honor...

155
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,939
能够上蒙布克军事学校
...to attend Mountbrook Military Academy...

156
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,809
该校的任务在于
...whose mission it is...

157
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,286
确保本国的伟大精英 未来领导人之崇高
...to ensure the greatness of this country, its future leadership...

158
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,186
鼓励爱国主义
...encouraging patriotism...

159
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,051
扎下强烈道德基础 并提供服务给K
...building a strong moral foundation and providing the service of men...

160
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,231
这些为荣耀 自由和国家效命的人
...committed to the values of honor, freedom and country.

161
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,231
不过，首先K
But, first and foremost...

162
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,567
学校会先教你这招
...they taught you this.

163
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,786
（墨西哥，里约华雷兹）

164
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,026
再教我一次 “樱桃”要怎么说？
How do you say "cherries" again?

165
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,025
看来你要拿更多樱桃来了
Looks like you have to get more cerezas.

166
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,101
宝贝 我替你准备上百颗开心果了
Mami, I got you a hundred pistachios.

167
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,501
-还有刚好的Q量 -我要加在一起吃，两种都要
- With the right amount of salt too. - Well, it's a combination. I need both.

168
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,240
我为何这么听你的？
Why am I sucker for you, huh?

169
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,956
-怎么了？她说什么？ -那人好像茶包
- What? What's she saying? - That looks like T-Bag.

170
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,463
什么？
What?

171
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,306
他说他试图偷机场的行李
He said he was trying to steal luggage from the airport.

172
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,911
他身上有五百万，为何要K？
He's got five million dollars. Why would he...?

173
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,579
除非钱不在他身上
Unless he doesn't have it.

174
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,154
除非钱遗失在机场
Unless he lost it there.

175
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,690
-够了，费南多 -怎么了？
- Stop it, Fernando. - What?

176
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,920
你真的相信那笔钱在机场？
Do you really believe that that money is at the airport?

177
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,931
别管钱了 瞧现在我们拥有的一切
Hey, forget it. Look at what we have together.

178
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,161
你真的要拿来冒险吗？
Do you really wanna risk that?

179
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,505
我们需要的一切都在这里
We have everything that we need.

180
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,001
-除了你的樱桃 -对
- Except your cerezas. - Right.

181
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,580
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

182
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,315
费南多
Fernando.

183
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,390
宝贝，我马上回来
Baby. I'll be right back.

184
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,191
你应该知道 我很会认出有毒瘾的人
You gotta know it's not real hard for me to recognize a junkie.

185
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:02,072
我K的意思是 你看起来不太好
L... l... I'm saying you don't look so good.

186
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,001
我很好
I'm fine.

187
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,672
介意我问你吃什么药吗？
You mind me asking what you're taking?

188
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,052
-拿去，要一颗吗？ -不用
- Here, you want one? - No, that's okay.

189
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,319
留着待会吃
Save it for later.

190
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,790
维拉垂
Varatril.

191
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,296
苯重氮基Q是一种 药效很强的镇定剂
Benzodiazepine's a hard-core tranquilizer, man.

192
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,301
你每天都服用？
Take these every day?

193
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,374
每天20毫克
Twenty milligrams.

194
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,178
你一定感觉像在水中漫步
You must feel like you're walking underwater.

195
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,846
对
I do.

196
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,841
下面非常安静
It's very quiet down here.

197
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,521
那就是你开始服药的原因吧 为了得到安宁？
That's why you started, right? The peace and quiet?

198
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,657
但现在原因都变了，对吧？
That's not why you do it anymore though, is it?

199
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,359
现在是为了治头痛吧？ 你应该是夜不成眠
Now it's the headaches, right? And you probably don't sleep.

200
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,363
你知道这会毁了自己，对吧？
And you know you're gonna destroy yourself, right?

201
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,802
我尚未排除这种可能性
I haven't ruled that out as a possibility.

202
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,939
希望待会你的男友会打电话来
Hope we hear from your boyfriend.

203
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,783
我和曼宏探员有个不同点
There's one difference between me and Agent Mahone.

204
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,851
他不懂一鸟在手的价值 他只会不断旁敲侧击
He doesn't know the value of a bird in the hand. He keeps beating around that bush.

205
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,687
但你若不说出柏劳的下落 我也不在乎
But if you don't give up Burrows, I don't care.

206
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,432
-死一个，剩下一个 -我要和斯科菲尔德先生谈谈
- One down, one to go. - I need to talk to Mr. Scofield.

207
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,895
单独谈
Alone.

208
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,568
总统女士
Madam President.

209
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,865
借一步K
Could I...

210
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,074
谈谈好吗？
...have a word?

211
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,617
这么做不恰当，留您单独和他K
It wouldn't be prudent for me to leave you alone with Mr. Scof...

212
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,481
我的手下就在门外 我有保有隐私的权利
My men are right outside this door. I have a right to privacy.

213
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,816
我担心的K
Your rights...

214
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,184
并非您的权利
...aren't my first concern.

215
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,452
我非得提醒你 现在正跟谁说话吗？
Do I need to remind you who you are talking to?

216
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,997
出去时把门关上
Step outside and close the door behind you.

217
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,691
你为了你哥做的牺牲
The things you do for your brother.

218
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,858
真令人刮目相看
It's impressive.

219
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,664
我想说你也一样
I could say the same for you.

220
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,592
-但我不会说 -记住
- But I won't. - Bear in mind...

221
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,670
你的意见我毫不在乎
...your opinion means little to me.

222
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,004
这段录音
This tape.

223
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,705
在你身上吗？
You have it with you?

224
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,812
没有
No.

225
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,880
但我可以安排让你听听
But I can arrange for you to hear it.

226
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,919
轮不到你替我安排 斯科菲尔德先生
You don't make arrangements for me, Mr. Scofield.

227
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,524
我有专人会去办
I have people for that.

228
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:45,085
我不太确定录音的内容
I'm not exactly sure what is on this tape...

229
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,096
但我想 对我应该不会有什么用
...but I doubt it's of any interest to me.

230
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,429
那是你和你弟的电话录音
It's a recorded conversation between you and your brother.

231
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:56,233
我和我弟在他生前 通过数不清的电话K
Well, out of millions of conversations that I had with my brother during his lifetime...

232
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,376
我说具体一点
I'll narrow it down for you.

233
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,973
录音是在他死后录到的
It was recorded sometime after his death.

234
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,081
至于K
And this...

235
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,685
这段录音
...particular conversation...

236
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,214
你可能不会想让外人听到
...you might wanna keep in the family.

237
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,162
东西在哪？
And where is it?

238
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,858
我做了20份备份 放在20个不同的地方
Twenty different copies in 20 different locations.

239
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,736
我现在可以打电话给我哥
I can call my brother right now.

240
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,599
他可以放给你听
He can play it for you.

241
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,901
不能用电话，叫他拿过来
Not on the phone. Have him bring it here.

242
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,905
条件如下
These are the terms.

243
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,975
你用电话听
You can hear it over the phone...

244
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,078
不然就等上新闻再听
...or you can hear it on the news.

245
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,183
你自己决定
It's up to you.

246
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,428
这也是我开始的原因
You know, it's why I started.

247
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,654
开始什么？
Started what?

248
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,326
服药，和你的理由一样
Using. Same reason as you.

249
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,367
为何？ 因为住院实习时整晚不能睡？
Why? Because you had to stay up all night during residency?

250
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,332
因为贝斯手 当着姐妹会的面甩了你？
Because the bass player dumped you in front of the whole sorority?

251
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,635
对，你和我真是同病相怜
Yeah, you and I got a lot in common.

252
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,478
我也见过人死亡
I've seen people die too.

253
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,245
我想你没有害死他们
I'm assuming you didn't make them die.

254
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,679
你需要帮助
You need help.

255
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,448
那不是我要的
Not what I'm looking for.

256
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,621
为了你好 我希望你男友很快会打电话来
For your sake, I hope your boyfriend calls back real soon.

257
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,790
犸丽？
Maricruz?

258
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,963
人都到哪去了？
Where the hell's everybody?

259
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,061
宝贝？
Mami?

260
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,643
瞧瞧你，老朋友苏克
Hey, lookie here. Good old sucre.

261
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,747
你干了什么？ 她们在哪里？犸丽
What'd you do? Where are they? Maricruz.

262
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,611
等等K小声一点
Hey, hey, hey. Keep your cap on.

263
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,775
她们出去替大象宝宝摘苹果了
Out picking apples for the snuffaluffagus.

264
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,619
-要是你敢K -冷静
- Lf you ever... - Calm down.

265
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,382
她们随时会走进来
They're gonna walk back in here any minute.

266
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,489
代表我们有麻烦了
Which means trouble.

267
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,296
除非你想看我试用新枪 在你的拉丁妞身上下手
Unless you wanna see me try out the new T-20-Z on your bella muchacha Mari-poon.

268
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,129
你最好跟我走
I think you better come with me.

269
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,841
什么事？
Yeah?

270
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,406
林克柏劳？
Lincoln Burrows?

271
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,413
卡洛琳雷诺兹
Caroline Reynolds.

272
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,216
听说你有东西要给我听
I understand you have something for me.

273
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,124
-你还在吗？ -我在

274
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,027
很高兴终于和你通上话
It's good to finally talk to you.

275
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,797
蹲死刑监那242个晚上 我真希望K
Wish I had the chance one of those 242 nights I spent on death row, you...

276
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,994
把录音放出来就是了
Please, just play the tape.

277
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,515
很糟糕，我知道
It's awful, I know,

278
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,183
但别无选择 你必须和一切撇清关系
But the choice was clear, You needed to be far away from all of this,

279
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,812
的确 我是汪汪大海上的戴伦斯岛
I am, I'm the Isle of Terrence, far off to sea,

280
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,482
但还有我帮助你
But I'm still here for you,

281
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,891
听我说，别沉溺在负面想法
Now, listen to me, Don't dwell on the negative,

282
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,123
有些人可以沉溺，卡洛琳
some people deserve to dwell, Caroline.

283
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,268
只要打通电话就能找到我
You know I'm only a phone call away.

284
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,128
你离我也有三千里
And three thousand miles.

285
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,239
你知道这里有多冷吗？
Do you know how cold it is here?

286
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,642
这件事我们讨论过了，戴伦斯
We talked about this, Terrence,

287
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,909
你明知会感到孤单 但只是暂时而已
You knew that you would be lonely, but it's only temporary,

288
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,451
他的起诉程序已经开始了
His appeals process has started already,

289
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,556
这件事会比你的青春 还快过去
This is gonna fly by quicker than your 20s,

290
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:09,319
世界上的人 很快就会淡忘他
And soon the world will forget all about him,,,

291
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,463
他们也会忘了你，我保证
...and they'll forget about you too. I promise.

292
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,098
可是K
But...

293
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,996
见不到你让我好难熬
...it's killing me not being able to see you...

294
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,105
-亲爱的卡洛琳 -我也很想见你
...sweet Caroline. - I wanna see you too.

295
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,004
-但现在不能这么做 -这栋房子好大
- But that can't happen right now, - This house is so big.

296
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,737
我只能K想着你K
I just... I just think of you...

297
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,748
躺在床上想着你
...lying in bed.

298
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,380
-我知道，我也是 -你的温度、触感
- I know. Me too. - Your warmth, your touch.

299
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,223
他自杀时K
Was it quick...

300
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,834
走得快吗？
...when he killed himself?

301
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,370
比我父亲死时要快很多
Well, it was a lot quicker than how my father died.

302
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,506
他们射中他的背部
They shot him in the back.

303
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,673
他死在我怀里
He died in my arms.

304
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,712
我只想知道他是怎么死的
I just wanna know what happened.

305
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,307
你弟弟向我们道歉
Your brother apologized.

306
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,086
他说完对不起 就把自己轰得脑浆四溢
He said he was sorry and then he blew his brains out all over the wall.

307
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,086
他走得很快
It was quick...

308
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,194
那是他的决定
...and it was his decision.

309
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,525
现在轮你下决定了
And now it's time for you to make yours.

310
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,932
不行K我办不到K
No, no, no, no. Man, you know, l... I can't... I can't do it. I can't do that.

311
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,472
你可以的
Yes, you can.

312
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,379
没什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

313
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,273
你还不懂是吗？
You don't get it, do you?

314
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,384
这家伙是阻止不了的
You can't stop this guy.

315
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,321
没有你的合作我阻止不了他 但如果你愿意谈
Not without your cooperation, I can't. But if you talk to me...

316
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,386
如果你告诉我真相，我就能帮助你
...if you tell me what's going on, I can take care of you, okay?

317
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,622
你一定要相信我，富兰克林先生
You've gotta trust me, Mr. Franklin.

318
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,233
我可以帮助你
I can help you.

319
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,065
你是百元钞票吧？
C-Note, right?

320
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,136
对，随便啦
Yeah, whatever.

321
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:12,672
只要你把曼宏探员的话 一字不差告诉我
All I need you to do is tell me exactly what Agent Mahone told you.

322
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,113
只要你举发曼宏 我会把人生还给你
If you give me Mahone, I'll give you your life back.

323
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,553
上帝在对我微笑，我只能这么说
God's been smiling down on me, I can tell you that.

324
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,660
先是在阿哥马找到疯仔
First I caught up to Haywire up in Algoma.

325
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,695
他在被逮之前 从谷物升降机上跳下
He did a dive off an elevator before they could put him away...

326
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,425
-但我还是能拿赏金 -等等，他死了？
...but I still get the reward. - Wait, wait. He's dead?

327
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,934
对，像撞上卡车玻璃的小虫 希望你别有样学样，苏克
Yep. Like a gnat on a Peterbilt. Hope you don't take the same route, sucre.

328
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,733
-不会，我活着的理由很多 -希望其中包括回福克斯河
- Hell, no. I got plenty reasons to live. - I hope a few of them are in Fox River.

329
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,139
如果你乖乖就范 我或许可以赏犸丽一点钱
Or maybe if you play nice, I'll throw your Maricruz a couple of bills.

330
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,779
-但要先把你抓回去 -你抓我们能拿多少？
- After I turn you in. - How much are you getting for us?

331
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,678
十万 你一定不知道自己值那么多钱吧
A hundred grand. I bet you never thought your ass would be worth all that.

332
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,682
等等K
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,823
如果我知道哪里有五百万呢？
What if I know where you can get 5 million dollars?

334
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,994
你没听错
You heard me.

335
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,163
-在哪里？ -我可以带你去
- Where is it? - I could take you there...

336
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,096
但你不能把我抓回美国 交给警方
...if you didn't have to take me back to the states and turn me back in.

337
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,600
钱在哪里？
Where is it?

338
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,210
茶包来了
T-Bag's in town.

339
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,305
很久以前我就已下定决心
I made my commitment a long time ago.

340
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:23,818
我决定把国家摆在自己之上 就像母亲对孩子一般
I agreed to put my country ahead of myself, like a mother does for a child.

341
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,224
我以为K
And I thought...

342
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,921
我的作为是高贵之举 我将得到赏识
...that what I was doing was noble and that I would be rewarded.

343
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,257
你错了
You were wrong.

344
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,596
你还不了解 我也只是个棋子吗？
Don't you see that I'm a pawn in this too?

345
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,102
控制了这个国家的力量
The power that has taken over this country...

346
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,004
就像癌症，而且没有东西能阻止
...is like a cancer and it will stop at nothing.

347
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,077
-我并无权控制 -这件事也一样
- It is out of my control. - So is this.

348
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,175
告诉我你要我怎么做
Tell me what you want from me.

349
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,043
解开我的手铐
Uncuff me.

350
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,614
-我没有钥匙 -你会去拿的
- I don't have the keys. - You'll get them.

351
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,918
第二，我要你安排 让我单独离开
Second, I want you to arrange for me to walk away from here alone.

352
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,754
不准跟踪我
No surveillance.

353
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,421
好
Okay.

354
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,230
最后K
And finally...

355
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,795
我要你用总统赦免权 赦免我和我哥
...I want a presidential pardon for me and my brother...

356
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,101
将我们的罪行一笔勾消
...fully exonerating us of all our crimes.

357
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,369
我要你今天就办好
And I want it today.

358
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,790
我不能随便选一个人赦免
I can't just hand out pardons to anyone I choose.

359
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,689
-有一定的程序和规定 -这次也一样
- There is a process, rules. - This is no exception.

360
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,161
公文会呈报给你批示 就跟其他赦免案一样
A document will be delivered for your approval just like any pardon.

361
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,197
你要签署同意，并交给K
You'll sign it and then file it...

362
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,428
司法部长 他会提交至总统纪录中
...with the attorney general, who'll submit it to Presidential Record.

363
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,869
好吧，你要我签署什么都可以
Fine. I will sign whatever you need me to sign.

364
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,703
你真大方 但你我都清楚这还不够
That's very kind. But we both know that's not enough.

365
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,970
你到底想怎样？
What do you want from me?

366
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,343
我会亲自替你解开手铐 送你出去
I will unlock you myself, walk you out of here.

367
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,916
难道还要我载你去机场？
What, you want me to drive you to the airport?

368
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,350
我只是不像以往那么相信人 尤其是在文件方面
I guess I'm not as trusting as I used to be. Especially with paperwork.

369
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,456
没两下子就遗失了
It's so easy to lose.

370
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,422
我要你出去，到群众面前
Now, I want you to go out there in front of everyone...

371
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,927
在现场转播中 宣布赦免我们的罪
...and announce our full pardon on live TV.

372
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,095
你疯了
You're insane.

373
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,599
事情不是这样办的
That is not the way things are done.

374
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,136
我没有与世隔绝，民众会起疑心
This is not a vacuum. People will ask questions.

375
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,833
立刻上台宣布大赦
Pardon. On stage. Now.

376
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:34,376
我怎么能确定之后 你不会把录音曝光？
And how do I know that you won't release the tape an hour later?

377
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,220
你无法确定
You don't.

378
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,014
你只能相信我的话
You'll just have to take my word for it.

379
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,255
-我需要更多担保 -你休想拿到
- Well, I need more than that. - Well, you're not gonna get it.

380
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,024
卡洛琳
Caroline...

381
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,797
时候到了
...it's time.

382
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,439
做决定吧
Make your choice.

383
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,382
亚当斯，解开犯人的手铐 把他带来这，释放他
Adams, I need you to uncuff the detainee and bring him here to be released.

384
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,683
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

385
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:16,087
我要宣布赦免 斯科菲尔德先生和他的哥哥
I am going to make an announcement pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother...

386
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,990
他要毫发无伤地离开
...and he will walk away unharmed.

387
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,255
你疯了吗？
Are you out of your mind?

388
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,826
他手头上有明明白白的铁证
He has brought some indisputable evidence to light.

389
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,268
我们现在就能结束一切
We could end this all, right now.

390
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,736
你却让他们离开？
You're gonna let them walk?

391
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:34,276
我是美国总统 你只是体制下的小卒
I am the commander in chief, and you are a corporate lackey.

392
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,739
决定权在我，你无权过问
I am making the calls now. You have no authority.

393
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,948
我的人会确保
My men will see to it...

394
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,647
斯科菲尔德先生安然离开
...that Mr. Scofield walks away without the interference...

395
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,917
你和你的走狗们不得干涉
...of you and your pit bulls.

396
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,126
-你一个人？ -对
- You alone? - Yeah.

397
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,159
-情况如何？ -三张单程票、一个船舱
- How'd you do? - Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

398
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,767
太好了
Nice.

399
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,969
-我欠你一份 -不，我们扯平了
- I owe you. - No. We're even.

400
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,766
-酒是给你的 -太好了
- These are for you. - Nice.

401
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,674
还有这个
And this.

402
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,076
-这是什么？ -你们越狱时，艾迪
- What's this? - Eddie. When you broke out...

403
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,682
他和我赌一百元 说你会在一周内被抓
...he bet me a hundred bucks you'd be caught in a week.

404
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,876
我说，我认识的林克不可能
I said, no way. Not the Linc I know.

405
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,112
我想应该和你平分
Figured I'd split it with you.

406
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,823
要道别了是吗？
So this is it, huh?

407
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,891
对
Yeah.

408
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,628
祝你好运
Good luck.

409
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,297
-保重 -你也是
- You take care. All right. - You too.

410
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,561
小心一点
You be safe.

411
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,395
-这一带你比较熟 -对，第三街和雷辛街口如何？
- This is your neck of the woods. - Yeah. How's Third and Racine?

412
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,259
我会去等你
I'll be there.

413
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,001
我真的不想这么做，真的
I don't wanna do this. I really don't.

414
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,837
你K在说什么？
What are you talking about?

415
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,276
我已经给你机会了
You can't say that I didn't give you a choice...

416
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,348
你总是爱反抗
...you never take the easy way. You...

417
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,082
我发现你有这个特质
And I noticed that about you. You...

418
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,053
我早该知道你不会屈服 但我有职务在身
I should never expect it to be any different but I have a job to do...

419
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,420
有人逼我要完成职务
...a job that I'm being made to do.

420
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,085
接电话，莎拉
Pick it up, sara.

421
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,825
莎拉，接电话
Sara, pick it up.

422
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,563

请你K不要动
Just don't... Don't move.

425
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,870
我要电话，把电话给我
Okay, I need the phone. Give me the phone.

426
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,341
请你留在原地
Stay right where you are, please.

427
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,853
你不会想这么做的
You don't really wanna do this.

428
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,353
我要什么你根本不懂
You don't know the first thing about what I want.

429
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,634
-有收到我的简讯吗？ -有
- You got my message? - Yeah,

跟踪她 她会带你找到斯科菲尔德
Follow her, She'll take you right to Scofield,

432
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,972
长官
sir...

433
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,472
我们得谈谈
...we need to talk.

434
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,446
几分钟后，总统K
