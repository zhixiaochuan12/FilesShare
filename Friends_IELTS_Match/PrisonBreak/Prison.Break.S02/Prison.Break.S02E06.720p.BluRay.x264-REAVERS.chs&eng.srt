Mr. Kim. Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,600
-你的时间该用来跟踪她吗？ -没错

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,538
-我会通知总统 -我直接和总统联络

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,769
由我和她连络
I'll contact her.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,080
帕托西克没有家人？
No family with Patoshik?

7
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,684
-一点线索都没有？ -对
- Nothing? - Yeah,

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,946

跟包威和富兰克林一样在西部
out west. Just like Bagwell and Franklin.

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,892
认识迪比库柏吗？ 那笔钱在犹他州，他们全都要去
You know D.B. Cooper? The money's in Utah and they're all going to get it.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,260
你是福克斯河州立监狱的逃犯之一
You're one of them Fox River boys,

14
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,603
-找到地图了吗？ -没有，有人拿走了
- Come on, you got the map? - No. Someone else does.

15
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,543
我把地图记在脑海里后才毁掉
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,087
我知道地点 你们则有体力
I have the information, you have the manual requirements necessary...

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,224
可以挖出威莫兰的钱财
...to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty.

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,757
-进去 -好啦
- Get in. - Okay.

19
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,694
肯定就在前方
Should be dead ahead.

20
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,957
浑蛋们在上面盖满房子
The bastards built over it.

21
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,567
地窖不见了
It's gone.

22
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,500
15分钟后就要开店了
We have to open up in 15 minutes.

23
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,339
-有什么关系？冒险一下 -我说不行
- So? That doesn't matter. I dare you. - I said no.

24
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,176
冒险一下，拜托
I dare you, please.

25
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,222
（犹他州，图尔）

26
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,607
牧场不见了，麦可
The ranch is gone, Michael.

27
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,622
但是五百万可能还在
Well, the five million might not be.

28
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,757
你要如何找那些钱？
And you're gonna find it how?

29
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,450
难道你的屁股有纹上卜问棒？
What, you got a divining rod tattooed on your ass?

30
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,356
除了你对地图 所谓的清晰记忆
I don't wanna hear anything from you...

31
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,260
其他的事我一概不想听
...other than what your photographic memory spits out regarding that map!

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,791
对我说话客气一点，小子
You watch your tone with me, boy.

33
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,235
我会把你丢在路边 自生自灭，小子
I will watch you get tossed to the side of the road to fend for yourself, boy.

34
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,807
因为你要是 不记得地窖的位置
Because if you can't remember where that silo was...

35
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,944
你对我们就毫无用处
...you're worthless to us.

36
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,375
-你们，放我出去 -闭嘴
- Yo, fools, let me out. - Shut up.

37
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,074
-地图 -好K
- The map! - Okay, okay. All right, all right, all right.

38
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,479
放我出去，老大
Let me out, boss.

39
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,984
牧场位于一个区块中间
The ranch was in the center of a box.

40
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,454
一旁是绵羊路 库库辛路和它垂直交叉
Sheep Road on one side, Kokosing Road perpendicular.

41
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,459
土地中央有间牧场房
In the center of the property was the ranch house...

42
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,792
房子旁边围绕着树木
...and the ranch house was surrounded by trees.

43
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,433
放我出去
Let me out.

44
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,405
这里每棵树都是刚种的
Every tree here is a year old at most...

45
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,913
除了那些之外
...except those.

46
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,918
地窖在哪里？
Where's the silo?

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,619
在树木内侧，应该是左方
Inside the trees, I wanna say on the left...

48
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,320
但那里可能有个谷仓
...but that may have been a barn.

49
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,028
各位，我已经尽力回想了 但我没料到这里
I remembered the best I could, gents, but I didn't know this place...

50
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,067
会盖满了房子
...would now be smothered in tract homes.

51
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,434
抱歉，我可没有天才的记忆
So, you know, I'm sorry that I'm not Rain Man over here.

52
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,501
（犹他州Q湖城，联邦大楼）

53
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,276
-亚历曼宏，你好 -莱尔山兹
- Alex Mahone. How are you? - Lyle sands.

54
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,472
我们已了解逃犯状况
We've been briefed on all the men at large.

55
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,881
Q湖城分局的所有人力资源
The full force and resources of the entire salt Lake City Field office...

56
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,281
都任你差遣
...are at your disposal.

57
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,514
谢谢，我方分局要的 迪比库柏档案准备好了吗？
Thank you. Do you have the files my office requested on D.B. Cooper?

58
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,092
现在正在调资料，是30年前 迪比库柏案的资料吗？
We're pulling them now. And this is the D.B. Cooper case from 30 years ago?

59
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,196
对，如果能马上给我资料 我会很感激
Correct. If I can get those files immediately, I'd appreciate it.

60
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,629
抱歉，你不是要来抓 福克斯河八人帮吗？
Sorry, but I have to ask. Aren't you here for the Fox River 8?

61
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:06,534
对，他们来犹他州 找迪比库柏的钱
I am. And they're here in Utah to get D.B. Cooper's money.

62
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,071
快给我档案好吗，莱尔？
So how about those files, Lyle?

63
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:14,203
-地窖K -这样做太蠢了
- Silo. Silo, silo. - This is stupid.

64
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,946
-我们会被抓到的 -闭嘴，我想起来了
- We're gonna get made out here. - All right, shut it. I think I remember.

65
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,918
如果要我打赌 我有把握地窖在房子左边
If I had to bet, I'd lay it all on the silo being on the left of the ranch house...

66
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,420
树的内侧
...inside the trees.

67
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,923
不对，是在树的外侧
No. It's outside the trees.

68
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,925
就在那边
Right there.

69
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,089
看见那两棵树了吗？ 它们比其他树矮
You see those two trees? They're shorter than the rest.

70
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,363
树木都是同时种植的 可是阳光比较难照到它们
They were all planted at the same time but those two didn't get as much sunlight.

71
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,170
有东西挡住了阳光
Something was in their way.

72
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,871
就是地窖
The silo.

73
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,704
我们的钱 应该就在那座车库下方
Our money should be right there, under that garage.

74
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,607
最好是对的，小子
You better be right, boy.

75
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,839
这里不是高级的分售土地
This isn't a high-end subdivision.

76
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,916
建商仓促拆掉原本的建筑
They slapped this place up overnight.

77
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,246
地窖的地基可能还在
The silo's foundations might still be there.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,820
为了省钱 建商应该只是在地基上
To save money, they probably just laid the concrete...

79
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,082
铺了水泥当作车库地板
...for the garage floor right on top of it.

80
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,524
我们往下挖，挖到地基就留下 没有的话就离开
We'll dig straight down. If we hit the foundation, we stay. If not, we go.

81
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,926
动手吧
Let's do it.

82
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,696
可恶
Oh, man.

83
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,812
拿螺丝起子杀了她 就没问题了
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver to her temple won't fix.

86
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,617
人死是很正常的事，两位
People die all the time, boys.

87
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,125
五百万却是可遇不可求
Five million dollars comes once in a lifetime.

88
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,856
-让我出来，你们别这样 -我们得想个办法
- Let me out of here, man. Come on, guys. - Well, we gotta do something.

89
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,125
不要伤害任何人
And it's not gonna involve hurting anyone.

90
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,340
我有办法了
I got an idea.

91
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,533
首先我们需要些工具
First, we're gonna need some supplies.

92
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,291
我绝对不同意
A hundred and 10 percent, I do not agree with this.

93
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,695
想要成事就得靠所有人出力
Everybody's gotta pitch in to make this happen.

94
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,667
但狱中的经验显示 不能相信那小伙子
But back in the big house, the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

95
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,305
所以我们才在外面下手
Which is why we're doing it here.

96
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,670
如果他在镇上被抓到 也不知道屋子在哪
If he gets caught in town, he ain't got a clue where the house is.

97
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:01,041
而且不能背叛的人是你
Besides, you're the one we can't turn our backs on.

98
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,686
老兄，我差点死掉
I could have died in there, man.

99
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,221
你猜怎么着？我需要你的帮忙
Well, guess what. I need you to do something.

100
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,988
你先帮我一个忙 我也要分一份钱
I need you to do something for me. I want my cut of the money.

101
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,860
等你证明我们可以信任你 一切好谈
Well, we'll talk once you prove we can trust you.

102
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,129
要我做什么？
What do I gotta do?

103
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,999
我要你回去那间园艺店 把清单上的东西拿来
I want you to go back to that garden center and get everything on this list.

104
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,972
还有替车子加油
And gas up the car.

105
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,574
一小时后回来这里找我们
And we'll meet you right back here in an hour.

106
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,111
-好 -大卫
- All right. - And, David...

107
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,254
不要搞砸了
...don't screw this up.

108
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,654
这里不是福克斯河监狱
This ain't Fox River no more, man.

109
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,155
在外面我才是真正的高手
You're looking at the real deal now.

110
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,696
但是我要分一份钱
But I want my cut.

111
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,965
一小时后我就回来
Be back in an hour.

112
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,103
我们走吧
Let's go.

113
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,974
你们错了
Mistake.

114
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,377
大错特错
Big mistake.

115
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,316
（犹他州北部，36号公路）

116
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,573
真是的
Oh, come on, now.

00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,175
我真高兴见到你
Am I glad to see you.

118

你徒步来这里？
You walk here?

119
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,178
不，说来话长
No, it's just a long story, man.

120
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,842
你不是要去和家人团聚吗？
I thought you were meeting up with your family.

121
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,046
我在途中遇到了一些阻碍，你呢？
I met a few roadblocks. And you?

122
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,282
我也是
Yeah.

123
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,053
我猜猜，你要去图尔
Well, let me guess. You're going to Tooele.

124
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,991
对
Yeah.

125
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:35,033
看来我们要去同一个地点
Well, looks like we're going the same direction.

126
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,692
希望我们来得不会太迟
Hopefully, we're not too late.

127

可以让我搭便车吗？
Can I hitch a ride?

128

听我说K
Hey, look...

129
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,376
帮助我绝对是值得的

（FBI分局 伊利诺州芝加哥）
We've got some good news, sir.

有好消息，长官

132

首次有帕托西克的消息
We got our first tip on Patoshik.

133

Spotted at a burger joint in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.

134

先交给当地警方调查
Hand it over to local authorities for now.

- Harold Jenkins. - Yeah.

140

对，迪比在抢劫当天
D.B. Bought gas from Jenkins...

141

用一百元向杰金斯买汽油
...with a hundred on the day of the hijacking.

142

We checked the serial numbers and they matched.

143

这是你承办的案子？
You worked the case?

144
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,542
我当时刚毕业，至今无人能破案
Fresh out of the academy and nobody's cracked it yet.

145
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,413
你为何认为 这些逃犯知道钱藏在哪里？
What makes you think that these escapees know where the money is?

146
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,183
因为他们可能和真的 迪比库柏当过狱友
Because they may have been locked up with the real D.B. Cooper.

147
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,350
加油站的杰金斯还活着吗？
Jenkins from the gas station, he still alive?

148
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,359
应该是，当时他才18岁
Should be. He was only 18 at the time.

149
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,726
我们去找他吧
Well, let's go say hi to him.

150
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,692
（伊利诺州，芝加哥）

151
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,088

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,126
抱歉，此号码无法拨通

153
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,170
请查明后再试
Please check the number and dial again,

154
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,709
（786-369-6468 736-339-8687）

155
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,649
莎拉丹奎迪有新消息吗？ 这应该是你来的原因吧
Do you have updates on sara Tancredi? I assume that's why you're here.

156
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,812
（华盛顿）
Yes.

157
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,253
对
Scofield sent her a message through the mail.

158
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,224
史柯菲传讯息给她

159
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,558
一个电话号码，不过是空号
A phone number that was disconnected.

160
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,667
老实说K
You know, to be honest...

161
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,737
我以为我是来向总统呈报
...I was expecting to brief the president.

162
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,534
好，关于这件事
Yeah, about that.

163
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,943
你应该能理解 卡洛琳现在很忙
Right now, as you can imagine, Caroline's quite busy.

164
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,483
她一向都很忙 我在她身边工作15年了
She's always been busy. I've been working with her for 15 years.

165
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,913
保罗K
Paul...

166
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,145
她现在是美国总统
...she's the president of the Unites states now.

167
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,653
对，是比尔和我帮她升官的
Yes, Bill and I helped to put her there.

168
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,816
如果你希望她继续执政
Well, if you'd like for her to remain in office...

169
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,291
我建议你现在开始行事低调
...you'll take my advice and just stay on the sidelines for now.

170
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,098
她现在不能和林克柏劳 牵扯上任何一丝关系
She needs to be completely insulated from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.

171
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,234
我要见她
I wanna talk to her.

172
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,177
现在你只能向我一个人呈报
You report to me now, and only me.

173
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,008
在我批准前不准联络卡洛琳
Don't try and contact Caroline again without my approval...

174
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,243
你也不能说来就来
...and don't show up here unannounced.

175
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,185
完成你的任务，找到柏劳
Finish the job you were given. Get Burrows.

176
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,088
你说透过莎拉丹奎迪能找到他 就不计代价K
If you're telling me the road to him leads through sara Tancredi, by all means...

177
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,730
把他找出来吧
...pursue it.

178
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,595
等你完成任务 人们淡忘这件事后
And once that's been accomplished and this whole thing goes away...

179
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,201
我们会再把你 调回卡洛琳的身边
...we'll go about transitioning you back into Caroline's life.

180
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,340
莎拉身上还有其他消息吗？
Now, do you have anything else on sara?

181
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,378
总统对你坚信不移
The president has unwavering faith in you.

182
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,606
她要你亲自眼见参议院
She wants you to go through senate approval...

183
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,011
审核的过程
...with your eyes wide open.

184
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,153
有谁对我们不利？ 国会和参议院有关键同盟
- So what are we up against? - Key allies in the House and senate...

185
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,186
包括梅尔霍夫 邦威尔和桑莫维尔
...are Meyerhoff, Barnwell and sommerville.

186
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,291
-他们有可能会投靠我方 -有谁反对？
- Counting on them to sway the middle. - Who's the opposition?

187
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,757
布雷克和克罗伦参议员 口头反对
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly vocalized...

188
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,657
你当副总统
...their opposition to you as VP.

189
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,889
他们有提出原因吗？
Any indication as to why?

190
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,593
政治报复，因为总统 上个月同意能源法案
Political payback for the president's vote on the energy bill last month.

191
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,294
他们很惊讶 而他们不喜欢出奇不意
Took them by surprise and they don't like surprises.

192
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,677
爸K兰斯 这位是我的父亲弗兰克
- Dad. Lance, this is my father, Frank. - Pleasure to meet you, sir.

193
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,972
很高兴认识你

194
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,082
没什么好担心的
It's nothing to lose sleep over.

195
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,912
老实说，现在最严重的问题
Frankly, the biggest issue we have to address...

196
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,577
只有令嫒可能面临的刑责
...are the charges facing your daughter.

197
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,087
州长，你有听到吗？
Governor, are you with me?

198
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,759
当然
Absolutely.

199
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,020
（伍德园艺行）

200
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,705
你安静点，好吗？
Yo, just chill, dog. Listen...

201
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:16,780
等我完事，离开这里 我们会通报，就会有人来救你
...once we roll out, we bounce out of town, we'll drop a dime and they'll find you.

202
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,816
安静点，老兄
Just be quiet. Just chill, man.

203
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,665
伍德？
Woody?

204
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,272
你在哪？伍德
Where you at? Woody?

205
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,987
我找威廉斯警长
I need sheriff Williams.

206
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,355
好，我在线上等

00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,233
伍德？
Woody?

208
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,246
你怎么会懂电工的事？
Where'd you learn about electricity?

209
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,152
我以前会从变电箱偷裸铜线
I used to steal copper wiring from transformer boxes.

210
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,816
然后拿去码头卖掉，赚点小钱
Then I'd sell them on the docks, make a few bucks.

211
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,694
你当时都在学校
You were in school, of course.

212
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,233
我只是看看而已，帅哥
I was just looking, pretty. What's that old chestnut?

213
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,209
看看菜单不代表我会吃
I can look at the menu, doesn't mean I'm gonna eat.

214
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,009
我们进去拿钱，之后就离开
We get in, we get the money, we get out.

215
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,084
-仅此而已 -那当然
- That's it. - No, absolutely.

216
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,391
成功了
We're good.

217
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,966
现在都要靠那小子了

-怎么了？ -好啦，我说
- What? - Whoa. Okay.

221
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,335
听好，有个家伙来店里
Check it. This fool came in the shop.

222
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,767
他怪怪的，发现事态不对劲
He was acting all shady, he got a bad vibe...

223
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,540
然后他拿起手机打电话 所以我打了他
...so he picked up his cellie phone, he started to make a call, so I popped him.

224
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,546
-什么？ -我用铲子打他
- What?! - I hit him with the shovel, man.

225
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,412
我不知道能怎么办
I didn't know what else to do.

226
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,283
我把他绑起来 把他跟那乡巴佬关在一起
I tied him up and I put him in the back room with that other country hick.

227
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,449
-你们看吧K -至少我成功了，娘娘腔

00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,468
-电话有打通吗？ -也许，我不知道
- Did the call go through? - Maybe, man. I don't know.

231

也许？他有打通吗？
Maybe? Did the call go through?

232
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,796
有，不K我也不知道 我不知道
Yes, l... No, I don't know. I don't know, man.

233
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,239
可是我把东西拿来了
Yo, but I got the gear.

234
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
我们得快点行动
We gotta move on this now.

235

我已经远离她50尺了
I'm staying 50 feet away from her at all times.

241
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,166
她到底还想怎样？
What the hell else does she want?

242
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,030
这不是我找你的原因
I'm not here about that.

243
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,900
-那是什么事？ -迪比库柏
- What are you here for? - D.B. Cooper.

244
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,905
还有人在调查这家伙？
People still wanna know about that guy?

00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,737
真难以置信
Unbelievable.

00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,472
你在他去过的 美国福克加油站工作过
You worked the gas station in American Fork where he filled up.

247
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,812
对，他看起来很平常 几乎没有说话

248
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,649
你30年前做的笔录 内容有些不一致
There were some discrepancies in the statement you filed 30 years ago.

你在笔录中指出 他在早上七点来加油
In the report, it's noted that you said he filled up at 7 a. M...

250
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,293
之后你又说是晚上七点
...but on another occasion, you said it was 7 p.m.

251
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,490
-哪一个才对？ -都对

00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,577
是谁弄坏的？
And who corrupted it?

261
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,189
-你们吗？ -有可能
- You guys? - Maybe.

262
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,451
我只知道我的上司要我
All I know is my supervisor called and said he wants me and my crew...

263
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,790
和组员过来这里 立即修复问题
...to get over here and fix that problem double quick, double time.

264
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:05,731
-所以你们不是电力公司的人？ -不是，女士
- So you're not with the electric company? - No, ma'am.

你尽管通知你的公司

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
不过我告诉你 他们只会派技术人员来
But I tell you, all they'll do is send over some tech.

267
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,242

那么K

276
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,563
是的，女士
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,138
迪比库柏的车 是1965年的雪佛兰新星
Yeah, D.B. Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.

278
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,344
库柏没有持有车辆的纪录
There's no record on file that Cooper even had a car.

279
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,277
可是查理威莫兰有车子 他当时登记的车
But Charles Westmoreland did and the car registered to him...

280
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,977
是1965年的雪佛兰新星 油箱可装16加仑
...at the time was a 1965 Chevy Nova with a 16-gallon gas tank.

281
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,816
当时雪佛兰那样的车 一加仑约可跑八里
Back then, a Chevy that size got approximately eight miles to the gallon.

282
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:03,155
迪比库柏在美国福克加油站停下 早上先加一次油
D.B. Stopped at the station in American Fork and gassed up once early that day...

283
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,593
同一天晚上又回来再加油
...and then came back later that same night and gassed up again.

284
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,257
一个要直接 往南到墨西哥的人
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico, which is a straight shot south,,,

285
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,630
为何会花一整天偏离路线绕路？
,,, drive off the main road for an all-day detour?

286
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,032
-为了钱 -没错
- The money. - Exactly.

287
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,108
库柏，就是威莫兰 带着五百万元跳机
Cooper, Westmoreland, jumped out of a plane with $5 million.

288
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,714
不过威莫兰 被逮捕时身上没有钱
But Westmoreland didn't have the money on him when he was arrested.

289
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,748
他被捕前就把钱藏了起来 把麦克笔给我
He ditched it before he got caught. Give me that magic marker.

290
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,215
以美国福克为中心 他不可能去了
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further...

291
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,911
超过方圆64里的地区
...than 64 miles in any direction.

292
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,249
去查这地区内所有的消息
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.

293
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,392
这些逃犯就在其中一个小镇里
Those cons are in one of these towns...

294
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,154
就算是猫失踪的小事 也要通知我
...and if there's so much as a cat missing in one of them, I wanna know about it.

295
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,634
故障的线路正好通过你家车库下
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.

296
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,636
我们得挖开地板才能修理线路
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.

297
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,598
谁会赔偿这些费用？
Well, who's gonna pay for this...

298
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,210
还有清理和修理费怎么办？
...and what about the cleanup and the repair?

299
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,370
我们公司会负担所有费用
Well, the company will cover all costs.

300
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,981
我们只会挖个小沟槽
We'll just dig a small trench.

301
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,847
完工后，我们会再铺上水泥 看起来跟新的一样
Once we're finished, we'll re-lay the cement. It'll look as good as new.

302
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,988
要花多久时间？
How long is it gonna take?

303
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,989
无论如何，今天一定能完工
One way or another, we'll be out of here today.

304
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,254
我们该快点开工了，女士
Really need to get started, ma'am.

305
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,025
我们不希望让你这种美人
Wouldn't want a pretty little thing like yourself sitting...

306
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,793
今晚坐在黑暗中，对吧？
...in the dark tonight, now, would we?

307
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,927
那要看我旁边坐的是谁
Well, that depends on who I'm sitting with.

308
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,232
说得对
Touche.

309
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,839
好吧，你们动工 做你们要做的事吧
Fine. It's okay, y'all go ahead and do whatever y'all need to do.

310
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,814
珍娜，施工的噪音不小
Jeanette, the noise might be substantial.

311
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,510
你去打网球可能会好一点
You might wanna take in that tennis game after all.

312
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,316
不了K现在打球太热了
Oh, no, it's too hot for that now.

313
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,454
何况我要盯紧你们所有人 你们才不会偷东西
Plus, I gotta keep an eye on you all and make sure you don't steal anything.

314
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,256
女士
Ma'am.

315
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,330
-你好吗？ -很好
- How are you? - Good.

316
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,668
好，中间人呢？
All right, where's Tweener?

317
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,901
他在隔壁插延长线
He's next door plugging in the extension cord.

318
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:04,071
-我们得挖开水泥 -各位，有人来了
- We're gonna have to cut up the cement. - Yo, we gots company.

319
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,748
你好吗，小白脸？
What's up, snowflake?

320
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,660
你还是一如往昔 时机抓得恰到好处
Well, as always, your timing is flawless.

321
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,661
-我不懂你的意思 -让我解释给你听
- I don't follow. - Well, let me try to explain it to you.

322
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,496
现在我们在试图施工
We're trying to run something here...

323
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,468
不能让人随便进来
...and we can't have people walking in off the street.

324
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:33,769
是吗？你要我们离开 之后再寄支票给我们？
Oh, okay, so you want us to leave and then you can just mail us the check?

325
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,947
苏克，你信任我的
Sucre, I know you trust me...

326
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,380
你知道我会把钱分给你
...and you know I'll cut you in on that money.

327
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,851
可是现在你们俩会破坏一切
But the two of you being here right now jeopardizes everything.

328
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,282
我哪里也不去
I'm not going nowhere.

329
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,086
我要我那一份钱
I want my share of the money.

330
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,594
等等，老兄 这情况也不是第一次了吧？
Wait a minute, hold on, man. Ain't we did this dance before?

331
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,392
我说我要加入，你拒绝我
You know, I say I want in, you say no...

332
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,262
然后我威胁 要张扬你的勾当
...then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.

333
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,968
接着你决定和平相处 我们就是和乐融融的一家人
And then you decide to play nice and then we're one big happy family.

334
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,269
我们别浪费时间了，好吗？
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?

335
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,583
谢谢
Thank you.

336
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,990
天啊，你还活着？

而且生龙活虎，小子
And kicking, homeboy.

338
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,132
你们怎么找到我们的？
How'd you find us?

339
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,499
如果我可以替美军 做全球卫星
Man, if I can do rapid deployment of satellite communications...

340
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,436
通讯网路连线的话K
...for Uncle sam all over the world...

341
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,405
情况如何？
How are you guys doing?

342
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,206
你是谁？他们是谁？
Who are you? Who are they?

343
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,313
我打了通电话给上司
I had to call my supervisor.

344
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,282
他多派人过来 这件事要尽快完工
He sent them right over. This job is a top priority.

345
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,014
公司希望尽快 有效率地修复线路
They want to get this done as quickly and as efficiently as possible.

346
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,796
珍娜，如我说过 我们有很多事要忙
Well, Jeanette, like I said, there's a lot of work to do...

347
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,337
而且噪音会很大
...and it's gonna be noisy.

348
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,237
我忘了问你们要喝什么
Oh, drinks. I forgot to ask.

349
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,334
不用了，谢谢
We're good. Thanks.

350
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,180
情况不妙
Yo, man, this is not good.

351
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,749
她随时会闯进来查看我们
We got her up in our grill checking in on us all the time.

352
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,789
这小子说得对
The boy is right.

353
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:36,866
既然我不能挖，我自愿去缠住她
And since I can't dig, I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.

354
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,560
不准碰她
You don't touch her.

355
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,603
难道你是修女不成？
Who are you, sister Mary Francis?

356
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,173
我知道怎么讨好女人
I know how to play nice.

357
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,401
我会盯着你的
I'll be watching.

358
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,952
（威斯康辛州，细得格罗夫）

真是感谢你
Thank you kindly.

363
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:13,294
说吧，你怎么不用工作？
Well, now, how did you get out of working?

364
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,663
是工会的规定
Union rules.

365
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,235
一定要有一名组员监督
One crew member always has to supervise.

366
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,635
我待会再去检查状况
I'll check on them in a bit.

367
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,875
柠檬汁？
Lemonade?

368
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,649
还要冰块吗？
Little more ice?

369
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,481
好
Yeah.

370
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,798
我喜欢添加一点K活力
And I like mine with a little oomph.

371
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,059
既然你现在正在工作
But since you're on the clock...

372
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:55,867
你应该不能陪我喝吧？
...I guess you can't join me?

373
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,337
加一点就好
Just two fingers.

374
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,077
好
All right.

375
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,792
好久没喝了
It's been a while.

376
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,800
是吗？
Yeah?

377
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,779
威士忌总是让我感到K暴戾
Whiskey always makes me feel irascible.

378
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,311
我不懂那是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

379
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,579
可是听起来很有趣
But I do like the sound of it.

380
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,162
你擦的香水是“天使”吗？
Are you wearing Angel perfume?

381
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,329
没错
I am.

382
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,833
我猜它让你想起前妻吧？
That reminds you of an ex, I take it.

383
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,876
对
Yeah.

384
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,343
是好的回忆K
Now, is that good memories...

385
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,244
还是坏的回忆？
...or bad memories?

386
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,322
都有
Both.

387
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,962
你有找到犸丽吗？
Did you talk to Maricruz?

388
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,968
我不想谈她的事
I don't wanna talk about her.

389
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,169
我得去喝杯水
I gotta get some water or something.

390
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,936
去房子另一边的水龙头喝水
Use the hose on the other side of the house.

391
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,877

我们得去先去图尔加油

你不是已经加了吗？

405
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,879
园艺店的状况发生后 我就忘了，好吗？

我要你把车子的油加满

00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,719
没错，不过没必要惊动调查局吧？
A bit. Don't see how it warrants a visit from the FBI.

436
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,756
一名在圣路易念书女子的车
A stolen car was dumped outside of town...

437
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,918
在镇外被发现

还有这里 店老板的女友通报他失踪
And then here, the owner's girlfriend reports him missing...

440
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:28,205
接着他的朋友过来找他 也跟着失踪

00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,739
对，伍德和查特每次一有机会
Woody and Chet have been known to drop everything...

442
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,342
就会丢下一切跑去猎野猪
...and go boar hunting when the opportunity arises.

443
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,741
他们也不会事先告诉母亲
And they don't tell their old ladies.

444
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,420
曼宏先生，我用午餐钱和你打赌 这里一切安好
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money there's nothing amiss around here.

His dad will be showing up soon with the keys and you can look for yourself.

Whoa, what are you doing?

447
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,499
曼宏先生
Mr. Mahone.

They're here. Those escaped convicts. They're here in town.

谁在那里？
Who's there?

450
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,750

452
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,930
-麻烦你告诉我们发生了什么事 -有一个怪男人
- Can you tell me what happened? - There was this strange man.

00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,362
我做了花生酱 加果酱的三明治给他
I made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

454
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,062
我以为他是比利
I thought he was Billy.

455
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,704
等孩子们上床睡觉，我们会一起洗澡
And once the kids went to sleep, we'd take a bath.

慢慢地洗个澡

457
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:26,552
之后我会坐在那 看着她做保养的例行公事
And afterwards, I'd just sit there and watch her do her routine.

458
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,626
她会擦乳液，梳头发
She'd rub her lotion on, comb her hair...

459
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,458
再换上睡衣
...dress up in her nighttime fineries.

460
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,157
听得我心痒痒
Oh, you're killing me.

461
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,300
她的脖子有个部份，就在这里
She had this spot on her neck right here.

462
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,810
每次都会让她兴奋
Gave her goose bumps every time.

00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,949
还有香水味
And that perfume...

我的前夫是会计师
My ex, he was an accountant.

465
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,758
他真的很拘谨
He was really buttoned up.

466
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,128
每次房事都草草了事
It was wham, bam, thank you, sam.

467
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,039
他真是不应该
Well, shame on him.

468
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:25,972
你为何和那个女人分开？
Why did it end with that lady you were talking about?

469
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,947
我们分道扬镖罢了
Just went our separate ways.

470
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:45,525
我心中最佳的心碎良药是什么 你知道吗？
Do you know what I think the best cure is for a broken heart?

回到单车上
Get back on the bike.
