你让我别无选择 我现在就要通知警方
You gave me no choice. I'm gonna notify the authorities right now.

149

对不起K
I'm sorry...

150
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,391
我不能让你这么做
...but I can't let you do that.

151
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,601
我不想伤害你，亨利
I don't wanna hurt you, Henry.

152
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,604
-拿着枪的人还如此大言不惭 -为了说服你，我只能出此下策
- Said by the man with the gun. - Lf it's the way I can convince you, so be it.

153
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,140
拿枪指着我 是无法说服我的
Well, you're not gonna convince me by doing that.

154
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,904
-我不是你想的那样 -我很清楚你是怎样的人，迈克
- I'm not the man you think I am. - I have a pretty good idea who you are.

155
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,345
如果你真了解，你该知道 我根本不想进福克斯河监狱
If that's true, then you already know I never wanted to be in Fox River.

156

我根本不想认识你，亨利 我更不想毁了你的人生
I never wanted to meet you, Henry. I certainly didn't wanna ruin your life.

157
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,051
是吗？那你可真行
Yeah? You've done a pretty damn good job.

158
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,487
所有你对他说的话 我自己都说过，亨利
You're not saying anything to him I haven't said myself, Henry.

159
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,253
我查过这件事 他对你说的是实话
I've looked into this. What he's saying to you is true.

我只想救我哥一条命 我要世人知道真相
I just want my brother's life back. I want people to know the truth.

161
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,197
我愿意为这放弃一切 舍弃我的性命
I'd give anything for that. I'd lay down my life.

162
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,269
你拿着枪 此话当然说得轻松
That's easy for you to say, standing on that side of the gun.

163
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,704
如果是你拿着枪呢？
What if I'm standing on this side?

我们提供的是 有生命危险的必要医疗

我知道你想干嘛 你要等到她死掉才帮她吗？
I know. Are you gonna wait until she's dead before you give her help?

168
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,424
-你是这意思吗？ -我不想跟你争辩，先生
- Is that what you're telling me? - I'll not argue with you.

169
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,930

这污秽的血统不再遗害人间

我只想终止这血统 连根铲除
All I wanna do is end that bloodline, extirpate it...

354
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,028
再重新来过

Looks like the lifestyle's treating you well. Socializing over Cubans and cognac.

410
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,682
不过你不是来社交的吧？
But that's not what you were doing, is it?

411
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,419
亨利？
Henry?

412
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,224

我建议你不要挡路，年轻人
I suggest you get out of my way, young man.

416
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,844
我办不到
I can't do that.

417
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,777
除非你想害自己 和家人惹上大麻烦
Unless you'd like to cause serious trouble for yourself and your family...

418
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,082
我建议你 把找到的东西交出来

It's okay, it's okay. Easy, easy. It's okay, it's okay.

425
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,914
女士，你没事吧？
Ma'am, you all right?

426
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,215
怎么会这样？
I don't understand.

427
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,979
有人匿名通报说 这里有人被挟持
We got a call. Someone said there was a hostage situation here.

428
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,548

00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,577
令嫒恐怕有肾衰很的迹象
I'm afraid your daughter shows signs of renal failure.

432
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,752
她做过血液透析吗？
Has she ever had hemodialysis?

433
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,727
血液K没有K 以前没有这么严重过
No. Hemo...? No, no. This has never really gone that far.

434
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,758
你打算现在就做？
What, are you planning on doing it right here?

435
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,871
这里没办法做 她也还没准备好
We're not set up for it. Neither is she.

436
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,339
可是几条街外 有个郡立洗肾诊所
But there is a county dialysis clinic a few blocks away.

437
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:25,449
但我们得在她脖子上插导管 她才能接受检验
But we're going to have to place a catheter in her neck, so she can be examined.

438
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,948
不要动，甜心，会有点冷
Hold still, sweetie. This'll be a little cold.

439
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,179
没关系的，宝贝
It's okay, baby.

440
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,963
等等K那是什么？
Wait, wait, wait. What is that?

441
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,033
套针，用来插导管用的
It's a trocar. It's used for placing the catheter.

442
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,261
躺下，甜心
Lie down, honey.

443
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,668
-有必要做到这地步吗？ -听着K
- Do we really have to go this far? - Look...

444
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,115
我已经尽力在帮你 但你得认清一点
I'm doing the best I can here. But you gotta understand something.

445
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,750
你女儿生病了
Your daughter is sick.

446
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,547
这方法看似很极端 是因为情况紧急
Now, this may look like a desperate measure because it is.

447
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,596
会有点痛，甜心
This is gonna hurt a little bit, sweetie.

448
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,594
住手！住手
Stop! Stop.

449
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,294
走吧，宝贝
Come on, baby.

450
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,763
来吧，宝贝，我办不到
Come on, baby. I can't do this.

451
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,020
怎么回事？
What's going on?

452
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,185
我和波普谈好条件
I made a deal with Pope.

453
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,331
你和波普谈条件？ 什么条件？
You made a deal with Pope? What kind of deal?

454
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,439
如果他跟我们走 拿到我们要的东西K
If he came with us, and if we got what we needed...

455
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,668
我说我会自首
...I said I'd turn myself in.

456
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,040
什么？我们根本不知道 那是什么玩意儿
What? We don't even know what this thing is.

457
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,046
可能毫无用处，迈克 你知道这件事吗？
It could be nothing, Michael. You know about this?

458
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,143
他现在说了我才知道
Not until it came out of his mouth.

459
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,684
我只有这个办法
It was the only thing I could think of.

460
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:13,847
你们俩还是可以结束整件事 但我没办法帮忙了
You two can still finish this. You'll just have to do it without me.

461
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:18,021
我不会让你自首，迈克 这件事回不了头
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael. There's no coming back from this.

462
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,597
-听着 -停下来干嘛？
- Now, look. - What's the holdup?

463
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,030
你哥说的对
Your brother's right.

464
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:29,263
法院绝不会对你宽容以待
I wouldn't count on the courts to show you any leniency in this.

465
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,676
没关系，我说过 我会遵守诺言
That doesn't matter. I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

466
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,278
你已经遵守了
You already did.

467
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,051
我听过内容，这证据很重要
I listened to this. You have something here.

468
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:45,244
很多人会因此遭殃 但现在已经在你手上
There are gonna be a lot of people who wish you didn't, but you do.

469
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,414
-亨利K -我若是你，就会马上走
- Listen, Henry... - I'd go now, if I were you.

470
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,586
别以为我原谅你了
And don't consider this forgiveness.

471
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,629
事实上，我可能 马上会改变心意
In fact, I'm about 10 seconds away from changing my mind.

472
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,826
谢谢你
Thank you.

473
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,117
好K
Okay.

474
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,688
来吧K
Here, let's...

475
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,455
把帽子戴上，好吗？
Let's tuck you in, all right? Okay?

476
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,234
来，我们走
Come on, let's go.

477
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,703
听着，我们再坐着 休息一下
Listen, let's just sit for a little bit longer, okay?

478
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,118
等一下再走，好吗？
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

479
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,874
你知道爸爸很爱你，对吧？
You know Daddy loves you with all his heart, right?

480
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,475
我好爱你
I love you so much.

481
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,238
我真的对不起你
I'm so sorry.

482
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,942
对不起，宝贝
I'm so sorry, baby.

483
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,866
-什么事？ -有你的电话
- Yeah? - I got a call for you.

484
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,598
我再回电 刚接到北边的诊所通报
I'll call back. I just heard from some clinic up north.

485
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,106
富兰克林半小时前去过那里
They had contact with Franklin half an hour ago.

486
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,608
你最好接这通电话

00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,512
接过来
Put it through.

488
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,981

-你是负责人吗？ -对
- Is this the man in charge? - Oh, yeah,

490
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:03,992
我是班哲明迈尔斯富兰克林

491

但我有一个条件

把我妻子放出来
My wife, well, she goes free,

495
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,165
我女儿需要母亲
My little daughter, she needs her mother.

496
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,970
我没必要跟你谈条件 富兰克林先生
I don't think I need to make a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

497
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
如果我有你要的资讯呢？
What if I got something you need?

498
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,594
（赶快康复）

499

One they don't want us to hear.
