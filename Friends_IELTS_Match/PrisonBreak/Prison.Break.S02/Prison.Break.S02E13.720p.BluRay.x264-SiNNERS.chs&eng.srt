一个内线是不够的
It's gonna take more than one guy on the inside,

302

如果他的职位够高就可以
Not if the guy's in the right place,

你想把钱独吞 再杀了唯一证人
You wanted to steal money then kill the witness.

355

你到底是谁的律师？ 我说过不是我干的
Are you my attorney or theirs? I told you, I didn't do anything.

356
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,202
不，我只是解释 他们的理论
No, I'm just explaining their theory of what happened.

357
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,930
你向警方解释 你没有杀葛瑞
Your explanation to the cops that you didn't kill Geary...

358
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,304
是因为你忙着去偷 五百万国家的钱财？
...because you were too busy trying to steal 5 million in federally insured money?

359
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,342
可能对你不太有利
Probably not the best move.

360
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,106
-不过有好消息 -什么？

如果案子开庭 你极有可能K
If this case goes to trial, there's an excellent chance...

367
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:28,689
被判死刑
...you're sentenced to death.

368

这种案子不可能有好结果
These things never go down good.

调到单独牢房来

你就推荐我加入工作计划

之后剩下的刑期 我只要拉稻草、晒太阳
I can sweat off the rest of my time heaving hay and getting sun.

00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,130
-所以K -不是自由，但差不多了
- That's why... - It ain't freedom, but it's close.

462
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,137
所以你才要求来这里坐牢？
Is that why you requested to be sent here?

463
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,368
要是我去其他地方 身为前狱警，我死定了
Oh, I go anywhere else as a former C.o., I'm a dead man.

- They're not putting you in ad seg. - I don't care where they're putting me...

466
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,049
-有单独牢房就对了 -局势变了，队长
...take me to ad seg. - It's not like it used to be.

467
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,620
-狱警已经不是这里的老大 -什么意思？
- C.o.'s don't run the game anymore. - What do you mean?

468
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,452
典狱长换人了 他要改革，证明他K
This new warden. He's cracking down to prove he's serious...

469

Window's closing, Michael, once the truck moves...

478
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,334
我们现在逃 等于允许他们杀死我们
If we run now, we give them permission to put a bullet in our heads.

479
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,238
我们留下，一周内我就被处死 你会被关一辈子
We stay, I'm dead within the week. You're locked up for life.
