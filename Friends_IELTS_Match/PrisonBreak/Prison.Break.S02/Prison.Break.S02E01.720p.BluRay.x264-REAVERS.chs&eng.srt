如果监狱是你设计的 就有可能
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,428

不要开枪

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,117
站住 我会开枪的，史柯菲

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,372

60
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,370
片名：越狱风云

61
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,170
剧名：全力缉捕

62
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,705
先生，媒体准备好了
Sir, the media is ready.

63
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:26,508
可以的话，我想稍微谈谈 约翰魏克斯布思
I'd like to talk about John Wilkes Booth for a moment, if I could.

64
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,654
谋杀林克总统的人
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

65
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,413
12天
Twelve days.

66
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,751
花了这么久才找到他
That's how long it took to find him.

67
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,452
他当时在日记中写下 阴影是他的朋友K
In his journal during this period, he wrote that the shadow was his friend...

68
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,290
夜晚是他的世界
...the night his domain.

69
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,232
他承认了，那股驱使罪犯K
He acknowledged that neuroses driving the criminal,,,

70
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,030
犯罪的原动力K
,,, to commit the original crime is compounded,,,

71
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,734
会因逃亡而加大
,,, magnified by flight,

72
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,267
是因为紧追在后 警犬的声响
By the sounds of dogs at his heels,

73
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,269
恐惧变成妄想症
Fear becomes paranoia.

74
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,340
妄想最后变成精神病
Paranoia, ultimately psychosis,

75
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,610
我提到这件事是因为 140年后
I bring this up because in 140 years...

76
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,657
逃犯的基本心态仍未改变
...the fundamental mind of the escaped man has not changed.

77
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:11,490
逃犯一样是人，一样会害怕
The escaped man is still human, he is still afraid...

78
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,963
一样会不顾一切企图逃亡
...and he will stop at nothing in his attempted flight.

79
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,926
不过我们很幸运
Fortunately for us,,,

80
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:24,009
我们的对手只有影子和夜晚相助
,,, while our quarry has shadow and night as his ally,,,

81
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,805
而我们有更得力的助手
...we have something far greater.

82
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,879
就是电视
Television.

83
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,013
我期望国内所有在看电视的人
I would encourage everyone who is watching...

84
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,887
请仔细看看这些面孔
...everyone in this country, to take a good look at these faces.

85
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,792
这八人是现在美国的头号通缉犯
These men right here are now the eight most wanted men in America.

86
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,564
我以为计划周详 你看到有多少人在追我们吗？
I thought I thought this out. You saw all those guys back there?

87
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,968
重点是他们在后面，我们在上面
The key is they're back there and we're up here.

88
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,836
这样能维持多久？
Yeah. And how long is that gonna last?

89
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,204
对，尤其我们现在一毛钱也没有
Especially since we don't have a pot to piss in...

90
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,573
都要感谢亚布兹神奇消失的飞机
...thanks to Abruzzi's magically disappearing jet.

91
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
反正你也上不了飞机
You were never gonna be on that plane.

92
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,907
别以为我不知道你打算去哪
Don't think I don't know where you were going.

93
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,246
-我要去哪里？ -喔，我不知道
- Where am I going? - Oh, I don't know.

94
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,888
犹他州？
Utah?

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,981
你打算何时才告诉我们钱的事？
You planning on telling us about the money?

96
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,690
什么钱？
What money?

97
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,025
五百万美金 威莫兰埋在犹他州沙漠的钱
Five million dollars that Westmoreland planted in the desert in Utah.

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,500
-你根本不知道你在说什么 -是你希望我不知道
- You don't know what you're talking about. - You wish I didn't know.

99
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,194
等等，什么钱？
Wait, wait. What money?

100
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,503
典狱长
Warden.

101
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,840
FBI现在介入太早了，不是吗？
It's a little early for the FBI to be showing up, don't you think?

102
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,275
我明白，调查还是由你主导
Look, I get it. It's still your investigation.

103
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,544
但是只要逃犯越过州界 就是联邦事务了
Once those criminals cross state lines, it'll become a federal matter.

104
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,689
-不会发生这种事的 -希望你是对的
- Yeah, well, that is not gonna happen. - I hope you're right.

105
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,553
所以我建议你 先撇开任何政治成见
That's why I suggest that we cut through any interagency politics from the outset.

106
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,560
-一切坦白透明化 -那当然
- Full transparency. - Absolutely.

107
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,197
很好
Good.

108
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,129
那么或许可以跟我谈谈 丹奎迪医生
Then maybe you can tell me about Dr. Tancredi.

109
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,692
没什么好谈的
There's nothing to tell.

110
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,067
我听说她有可能帮助逃犯逃亡
From what I'm hearing, she may have abetted the escapees.

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,731
她打开门让他们逃出去
Opened the door that allowed them to get out.

112
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,706
-我说过，没什么好谈的 -你不太坦白，典狱长
- Like I said, there's nothing to tell. - You're not being very transparent, warden.

113
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,646
-听着，我不谈下属的事 -也许你应该谈
- Look, I don't discuss my staff. - Maybe you should...

114
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
因为她可能是整件事的关键
...because she may be the key to this thing.

115
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,622
我们需要找她谈谈
We need to speak with her.

116
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,220
曼宏先生，就现在而言 她不会跟任何人谈的
Well, right now, Mr. Mahone, she's not gonna be speaking with anyone.

117
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,964
情况如何？
How we doing?

118
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,402
点滴提供她水分
Well, the IVs are hydrating her.

119
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,271
每半小时替她注射 半毫克Q酸那克酸
We've got her on naloxone infusion. Half-milligram per hour.

120
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,776
你认为苏醒的机会有多大？
What do you think the chances are?

121
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,007
我们尽力了 一切得靠她自己
Well, we've done everything on our end. It's really up to her.

122
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:49,052
她坚持就能活命，放弃就会死
Either she fights and lives, or she quits and dies.

123
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,873
你在做什么K
Hey, what do you think...?

124
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,503
你想做什么随便你
Do whatever thing you've gotta do, man.

125
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,249
对了，小子K
Oh, and boy...

126
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,255
要是你敢报警，我手上的东西K
If you call the cops, I will put this thing right here...

127
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,728
就会插进你的眼睛
...in your eye.

128
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,932
谢谢
Thank you.

129
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,246
他是结构工程师？
Structural engineer, huh?

130
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,017
这种人很少会有这么多刺青在身上
Not the kind you'd expect to get that much ink.

131
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,420
应该说不可能刺青
Not the kind at all.

132
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,692
你觉得这种刺青 要多久才能完成？
How long do you think it'd take to get something like that done?

133
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,298
一百小时，两百小时
A hundred hours. Two hundred.

134
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,062
帮他刺青的师傅 一定和他相处了不少时间
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must've spent a lot of time with him, then.

135
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,833
我去查是谁
I'll find out who it was.

136
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,273
-贝里克先生 -不要烦我
- Mr. Bellick. - Don't talk to me.

137
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,812
好，但这样会很难合作
Fine. But it's gonna make collaboration kind of hard.

138
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,814
合作？ 我的手下在外身处危险之中
Collaboration? I got men out here in harm's way...

139
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,815
你却在开记者会
...and you're giving press conferences.

140
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,419
媒体是工具
The press is a tool.

141
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,113
媒体抓到他们的速度 比猎犬还要快
It'll bring those men back quicker than bloodhounds will.

142
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,519
我们不需要你
We don't need you.

143
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,718
我们已掌握他们的行踪 抓到他们是迟早的事
We're hot on the trail, it's a matter of time till we nail them.

144
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,125
我不满意你只是掌握行踪
The problem I find with being on a trail...

145
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,495
因为这代表你永远慢猎物一步
...is that, by definition, you'll always be behind your prey.

146
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,737
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

147
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,576
（蒙大拿州，布拉克富特）

148
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,512
我手上没有武器
I'm not armed.

149
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,775
请见谅 我现在很难信任他人
You'll have to excuse me if I'm a little short on trust at the moment.

150
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,751
我向你保证，小姐 我绝对不会伤害你
I assure you, young woman, I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

151
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,515
我确定我吃了止痛药 全身无力
I think the Percocet pretty much ensures that.

152
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:43,253
很好，那么你应该不介意 我拍下证据给子孙欣赏
Good. Then you won't mind if I capture this moment for posterity.

153
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,488
你拍照也没用的
Won't do you any good.

154
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,959
某人因为谋杀你的罪名要被处死 你都毫不在乎吗？
You don't care that somebody's gonna be executed for your murder?

155
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,933
选择林克柏劳栽赃的人 不是我
I'm not the one who chose Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.

156
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,571
那是谁？
Who did?

157
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,104
你姐姐，总统？
Your sister, the president?

158
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,868
你不懂，我是这整件事的囚犯
You don't understand. I'm a prisoner to all of this.

159
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,170
算了吧，你大可以出面说清楚
Oh, come on. You could've come forward.

160
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,076
在开始前 你就可以阻止整件事
You could've stopped this thing before it even got started.

161
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,547
不，我真的是囚犯
No, I really am a prisoner.

162
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,242
现在你也成了囚犯
And now you are too.

163
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,346
从你把门关上那一刻开始
The moment you let the door shut behind you.

164
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,123
外面没有保全人员K
Didn't it strike you as curious...

165
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,235
你不觉得怪吗？
...that there wasn't any security out there?

166
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,963
门只能从外面打开
The doors only open from the outside.

167
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,506
玻璃是两寸厚的防弹玻璃
The glass is 2 inches thick, bulletproof.

168
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,211
你逃不出去了，小姐
There's no getting out of here, young woman.

169
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,544
我们得甩掉他们
We gotta dump them now.

170
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,181
没办法 他们知道犹他州的事了
Can't. They know about Utah.

171
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,847
所以更该甩掉他们
All the more reason to dump them.

172
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,894
他们要是被抓，调查局就会清楚知道 我们的去向，他们会说出去
If they get caught, the feds will know where we're going. They'll tell them.

173
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,430
我们只需让他们不被抓到 直到我们到达犹他州
We just gotta make sure they stay afloat till we're off in Utah.

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,534
我们别无他法了
Doing what we gotta do.

175
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,665
你真的认为那里有钱？
You really think the money's gonna be there?

176
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,838
查理的话可信度也许不高
Charles might've had a flexible relationship with the truth...

177
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,276
可是到最后 他没有必要撒这种谎
...but at the end... At the end, there'd be no reason for him to lie about it.

178
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,949
我打算拿到钱 我们就逃到墨西哥
I figure once we bag it, we cross over into Mexico.

179
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,221
接着搭老旧的公车 一路到巴拿马
Take a whole bunch of bumpy second-class bus rides till we hit Panama.

180
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,253
-你真的很想开潜水用品店吗？ -没错
- You really got a fix on this dive shop thing? - Yeah.

181
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,055
现在要我躺在吊床上 躺十年、二十年我都不在意
Right now, I wouldn't mind swinging in a hammock for the next 10, 20 years.

182
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,200
半个国家的人都在追捕我们 我们到不了巴拿马或犹他州
We got half the country after us. We ain't making it to Panama or Utah.

183
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,597
要有人帮助才可以
Not without help.

184
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,301
哩诺卡帮不了我们
Veronica can't help us.

185
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,702
你这么有信心？
How can you say that?

186
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,811
-我们没有钱、衣服K -我都准备好了
- We don't have money, clothes... - We got all that.

187
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,474
我以为计划是亚布兹的飞机
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.

188
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,138
飞机只是A计划
Abruzzi's jet was plan A.

189
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,876
-那么我们K -一应俱全
- Then we got... - Everything we need.

190
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,486
在哪里？
Where?

191
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,190
我藏起来了
Storage.

192
00:14:55,794 --> 00:15:01,460
（时机成熟树林）

193
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,896
刺青是史柯菲设计的？ 不是你？
Scofield designed the tattoo, not you?

194
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,057
（FBI办公室 芝加哥，伊利诺州）
He brought the entire thing in. Every element.

195
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,636
设计图都是他带来的 所有细节

196
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,399
你看，这个刺青很仔细 这可是西斯汀礼拜堂
I mean, look at it. It's the frigging sistine Chapel.

197
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,543
我知道他是工程师，可是K
I know the guy was an engineer, but, man...

198
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,372
他真的很有艺术天分
...his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

199
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,946
还有什么？ 你觉得他这个人如何？
What else? What can you tell me about him as a person?

200
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,278
他很冷静
He was cool, you know.

201
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,784
但是他很要求细节 一切都要完美
But talk about a detail Nazi. Everything had to be perfect.

202
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,721
刺青要和设计图一模一样 我一直觉得整件事
Exactly as he drew it. I always sort of had the feeling...

203
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:31,329
是个只有他自己了解的笑话
...that the whole thing was some sort of inside joke that only he was in on.

204
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,761
（英格利、费兹、波西）

205
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,932
我们有你的电话对吧？
We have your number, right?

206
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,694
对
Yeah.

207

我可能会和你联络，谢谢
I may be calling you. Thank you.

208

富利
Foley.

209
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,878
我们到监狱的那条 很长的路叫什么？
What was the name of that road to get to the prison?

210
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,574
我想是英格利街
I think it was English street.

211
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,218
（英格利街）

212
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,687
还有监狱前方 两条交叉的路叫什么？
In front of the prison, the two streets that intersect with it?

213
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,021
-费兹街和波西大道，怎么了？ -谢谢

-准备出发 -我们要去哪？
- Saddle up. - Where we going?

215
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,261
我们不再是犯人 恢复老百姓身分的地方
Somewhere we can stop being cons and start being civilians.

216
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,636
说话不要拐弯抹角 有话直说好吗？
Yo, why don't you cut out all the riddles, snowflake, and just give it to us straight?

217
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,208
怎么了？
What?

218
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,147

快离开K退后

你们是福克斯河监狱的逃犯

但我刚刚如果不这么做
But if I hadn't done what I had to do...

286

我们现在就无法去看女儿了 不是吗？

And you think the cops don't know about it?

你不认为他们会坐在你家K
You think they're not just sitting there...

293

295
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,906
-那纽约呢？ -纽约怎么了？

我的女友怀孕了，老哥

想清楚，现在你爱的人 正是你的弱点

298
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,846
-警察都知道 -不代表不能去见她们
- And they know about it. - Doesn't mean it has to stop you.

299
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,479

300
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,918
还有要到达奥斯威哥

奥斯威哥不顺路，小白脸
Oswego is not on the way, snowflake.

302

重点不在奥斯威哥的位置
It's not where oswego is.

303
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,057
而是奥斯威哥有什么东西
It's what's in oswego.

304
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,492
队长，史柯菲的信用卡纪录

他在入狱前 在威尔郡花了很多钱

306
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,242
-没错 -他是芝加哥人

307
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,138
为何从芝加哥跑来这里K
Why does a guy from Chicago come here...

308
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,711
在一个多月内 就花了八千美金？

309
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,745
洗车、语音信箱、仓库、租车
Car wash, voice mail, storage, car rental.

310
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,473
-已经在查了 -很好

311
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,176
-队长，要告诉FBI吗？ -你觉得呢？
- What about the feds? Should we tell? - What do you think?

312

贝里克队长，有消息了
Captain Bellick, we got something.

313
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,320
松树林中 有位猎人遇见五个犯人
Hunter up by Tamarack just ran into five of the cons.

314
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,059
这里就是史柯菲住的地方
So this is where scofield lived.

315
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,633
对，直到两个月前 他入狱服刑

316
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,975
母亲过世，父亲是游手好闲的人
Mother's dead, father's a deadbeat.

317
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,576
全世界只剩下哥哥一个亲人
Got nothing in the whole world but your brother.

318
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,586
于是你就开始计划
So you plan.

319
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,734
花好几个月策划K
And you scheme for months...

320

直到找到最好的办法
...until you get it right.

321
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,272
计划出每一个环节
Every single element.

322
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,751
接着你摧毁所有的证据
And then you destroy all the evidence.

323
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,227
派潜水夫到河里搜索
I want divers down in the river.

324
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,434
手机不会有讯号的
You won't get cell coverage.

325
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,769
这里是荒郊野外
We're in the middle of nowhere.

西蒙大拿州 不会有数位基地台的
Those digital carriers don't have cell towers way out here in Western Montana.

327
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,811
-你闭嘴好吗？戴伦斯 -我只想让你省去麻烦
- How about shutting up, Terrence? - Just trying to save you some effort.

328
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,113
这些人像蜘蛛网 你越挣扎情况越糟糕
They're like a web, these people. Harder you struggle, worse it gets.

329
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,950
听起来像是个懦夫 想自圆其说
Sounds to me like a coward trying to justify himself.

330
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,459
只要我不碍事、闭上嘴 我就能保命
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet, I stay alive.

331
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,789
他们是这样告诉我的
That's what they said. That's what they told me.

332
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,762
你想继续过这种生活？ 活在密闭空间里
And you want to live like this? In a hermetically sealed box...

333
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,835
-外面的世界都不在乎？ -为了自保，人什么都做得出来
...while everything out there goes to hell? - Self-preservation is a strong motivator.

334
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,298
为了真相也是
So's the truth.

335

00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,777
在人生的过程中 你会领悟到
One thing you learn when you're walking the steps...

370
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,384
自己犯的错 不要去牵连或责怪他人

好吧
Well...

372
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,215
你不是第一个爱上犯人的职员

相信我

但我的方式错了
Not like I did.

380

我毁了她的人生

381
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,887
-你现在也爱莫能助 -不对
- There's nothing you can do about it now. - That's not true.

382
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,129

你打算开枪杀我吗？戴伦斯

把我打得血肉横飞？ 然后呢？
Blow my guts all over the house? Then what?

388
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,173
你走不了，记得吗？

只要我踏出去K
If I go outside...

394
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,158

你认为我是没良心的魔鬼？
You look at me like I'm the devil.

396
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,135
我丢下我的家人

00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,408
还有我的牙齿，我每天都在吃止痛药
My teeth. I eat Percocet all day...

398
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,913
以抑制我悲惨生命的痛楚
...just to dull the pain of my miserable existence.

399
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,020
-你根本不了解我受的苦 -你受的苦？
- You have no idea what I've been through. - What you've been through?

400
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
重点不在你身上，戴伦斯
This isn't about you, Terrence.

412
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,253
-你需要专科医生 -我没有K

你需要懂得治疗法的医生
You need somebody who knows what they're doing.

414
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,631
我没有选择余地，医生
I don't have the luxury of choice here.

415
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,393
我的手放在箱子里好几小时 快废掉了
My hand has been in that box for hours now. It is dying.

先生，我没有能力帮你

I only have one hand, but I can stick this in your neck before you get to that door.

Now, if that's not incentive enough for you, I see that you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.

在这一带有这种特殊姓氏
With a name like that in a county like this...

420
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,847
古达太太应该很好找，不是吗？

那不是地名，是人名
It's not a place, it's a name.

459

你真的很变态，你知道吗？
You are one sick cat, you know that?

00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,490
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

Originally, this was supposed to be a week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.

00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,508
不过你们和我们一样需要帮助K
But I figured you all need just as much help as we do, so...

你这么做是出自良心吗？
You're doing this out of the goodness of your heart?

472
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,846
约翰，没错，良心 你没忘记良心是什么吧？
Right, John, the heart. You remember what that is, don't you?

小白脸，这衣服真棒

如我所说，我们不能再当犯人了
It's like I said, we gotta stop being cons...

不错，但你不觉得裤子太短了？
Nice. The trousers are a little bit too short, don't you think?

把你的腿砍掉，你最在行
Chop your feet off. You're good at that.

478

这件夹克不太好看，你懂吗？
This jacket isn't exactly the best thing.

479

你想要选择？ 就去大卖场吧

只要你一出面 整件事就可以结束了

他们又没有留下逃亡地图
