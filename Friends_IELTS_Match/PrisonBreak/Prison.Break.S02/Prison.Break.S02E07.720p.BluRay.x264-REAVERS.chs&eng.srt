他说犯了罪，一辈子都是犯人
He said there's no such thing as an ex-con.

00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,026
说到人数，我们少了一个人
Speaking of numbers, we're short one.

143
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,501
那小子去加油也花太久时间了吧
Kid's taking a long time to fill that gas tank up.

144
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,481
我已经用尽各种方法逼他
I leaned on him in every way I can think of.

145
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,676
他就是不开口
He's not talking.

146
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,066
你是天主教徒吗？
Are you Catholic?

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,831
你是天主教徒吗？
Are you Catholic?

148
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,007
这宗教不太好，有很多罪恶
Not much good in it. A lot of guilt.

149
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,350
不过唯一的好处 就是告解
But the one good thing is confession.

150
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:03,090
不管心里有什么让你难受 你只管说出来就好
Whatever you got eating at you, you just give it up.

151
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,297
我得承认，这种感觉很不错
Feels good, I have to say.

152
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,828
我想是因为说出来
Guess it's letting it out.

153
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,862
-让另一个人听你告解 -我无话可说
- Letting another human being hear... - I got nothing to say to you, man.

154
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,380
如果我告诉你一件事呢？
What if I told you something?

155
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,445
一个无人知晓的秘密
A secret nobody else knows.

156
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,389
奥斯卡席尔斯
Oscar shales.

157
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,293
他是我几年前追捕的逃犯
A guy I was chasing a few years back.

158
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,858
精明的不得了
Smart as hell.

159
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,097
我总是慢他一步
I kept just missing him.

160
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,005
过程变得像比赛，仿佛下西洋棋
It became kind of a game, like chess.

161
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,138
要不是他在逃亡时不断杀人
Would've been fun if it weren't for the fact...

162
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,215
老实说，过程其实很有趣
...that he were killing people all along the way.

163
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:07,584
受害者不断增加 我开始觉得都是我的错
Bodies kept stacking up, and I started to feel that it was because of me.

164
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,359
因为我不称职
Because I couldn't do my job.

165
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,293
因为我不够聪明
Because I wasn't smart enough.

166
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,295
我一直没抓到他
Never did catch him.

167
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,498
但是过程中我失控了
But I did lose it.

168
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,436
晚上开车时，我会看见东西
Saw things when I would drive at night.

169
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,013
看到尸体
Bodies.

170
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,151
做恶梦做到我无法入睡
Nightmares to the point that I couldn't sleep.

171
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,684
我完全和现实脱节
It was a complete break from reality.

172
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,624
所以我才需要吃这些药
That's what these little guys are for.

173
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,958
让我能继续办案
Keep me in the game.

174
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,032
我已经一吐为快 告诉你了
So now you know. Now it's off my chest.

175
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,535
你也应该试试看
Ought to try it sometime.

176
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,789
我已经说过了
Like I said before...

177
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,118
我无话可说
...I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

178
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,662
你知道他们在哪里
You know where those guys are.

179
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,762
如果你要我当抓耙子，你就找错人了
If you're looking for a rat, you've got the wrong guy, man.

180
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,770
不，我只是想让你 少承受点罪恶
No, I'm just trying to spare you some guilt.

181
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:37,481
包威逃狱后不到24小时 就杀害了第一个人
Bagwell was free less than 24 hours before he killed his first victim.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,487
如果你不说出他的下落 他会继续杀人
If you don't tell me where he is now, he's gonna kill again.

183
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,593
这个罪都会怪在你的头上
And that blood is gonna be on your conscience and nobody else's.

184
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,860
告解也许不是件坏事，不是吗？
Confession might not be such a bad thing, huh?

我事先没有预定和律师见面
I don't have a meeting scheduled with my lawyer.

189

他是伊利诺州法院 指派的公设辩护人
He's a court-appointed public defender in Illinois.

190
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,922
他不可能事先没通知我 就来亚利桑那
I doubt he would come to Arizona without calling me.

191
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,616
走吧

你说律师叫什么名字？
What'd you say the name of that lawyer was?

197
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,301
没有告诉我，他告诉了典狱长
Didn't give it to me. Gave it to the warden.

那我要见监狱长 你有听到吗？

The only way that that woman comes out free...

328
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:23,573

也就是你
Being you.

330
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,919

00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,636
我知道的就是这么多
I don't know what else to tell you.

433
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,712
好吧，谢谢
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

434
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,730
他走了，可是我们得马上离开 因为他一到俱乐部
He's gone, but we gotta get out of here, because once he gets to the club...

435
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,534
就会发现她不在 到时他就会回来
...he's gonna find out she's not there and he's gonna be back.

436
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,081
你知道吗？你说的对
You know what? You were right.

437
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,275
一吐为快的感觉的确很好
It does feel good to get stuff off your chest.

438
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,018
抱歉我骗了你
I'm sorry I had to play you like that, bro.

439
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,160
你要做什么？
Yo, what's up?

440
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,764
来吧，路程很远
Come on. It's gonna be a long drive.

441
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,235
下车走走吧
Stretch your legs.

442
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,386
好吧
All right.

443
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:31,510
凯勒曼 你不是要处理罗杰柏劳的事
Kellerman, I thought you were gonna deal with the L, J, Burrows situation,

444
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,377
我办好了
oh, I did.

445
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,416
那他为何明天会被释放？
Then why is he being released from custody?

446
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,350
这小孩本身对我们毫无用处
In and of himself, the kid is useless to us.

447
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:42,083
让人来找他 对我们才有价值
His only value is in who comes looking for him.

448
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,426
比尔，更重要的是K
More importantly, Bill.

449

丹奎迪州长 他不在我们的计划之中

450

据我所知，你杀的人也不少
Last time I checked, you left no shortage of bodies in your wake.

451
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,631
为了卡洛琳的地位 我不得不这么做
No, I did what I had to do to get Caroline where she is.

452
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,297
既然她已经升官了 我们就没必要引人侧目
Now that she's there, let's not draw any more attention than we have to.

453
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,834
你以为往上爬的过程 才是最艰难的？
You think getting to the top is the hard part?

454
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,272
她现在是全世界的注目焦点 敌人多了几百倍
She's a hundred times more visible. Has a hundred times more enemies.

455

任何知道一点风声的人 都要处理掉

456
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,782
只要有人造成威胁 他们就得死
If someone is a liability, they go.

457
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,650
丹奎迪已经造成威胁
Tancredi was becoming a liability.

458
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,456
他的女儿也是
So is his daughter.

459
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,493
等等，什么？
Wait. What?

460
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:20,187
莎拉？
Sara?

461
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:23,961
再见，保罗
Goodbye, Paul.

462
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,467
（伊利诺州，芝加哥）

463
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,938
（注射用吗啡）

464
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,238
你现在和他们一起逃走
You walk out with those guys now...

465
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,509
迟早会被逮捕的 这你应该清楚吧？
...it's only a matter of time before you get caught. You realize that?

466
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,619
你不光要面对越狱的刑责
You're not just dealing with escape charges.

还有攻击、非法挟持、绑架K

468
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,685
-我现在不想听 -你应该听
- I don't need to hear this. - No, you do.

469
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,316
你认为你能p遥法外多久？
How much longer do you really think you can stay ahead of the cops?

470
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,163
如果你自首K
Look, if you turn yourself in...

471
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,359
我会出庭作证 我会说你愿意合作
...I will testify at the sentencing, I will say that you cooperated.

472
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,299
-这会有很大的帮助 -闭嘴
- That can make a difference. - Shut up.

473
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,700
聪明一点
Be smart.

474
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,172

-还是22岁生日？ -闭嘴
- Or its 22nd? - Shut up.

476
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,911
如果你不想听 自己的大错特错
If you didn't wanna hear what a big mistake you were making...

477
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,776
你早该堵住我的嘴K
...you would've put that gag back on...

478
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,157
费南多，我们该走了
Fernando! It's time to go!

479
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,756
现在回头还来得及，费南多
You can still do the right thing, Fernando.

480
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,833
你瞧瞧K
Hey, looky here.

481
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,166
你瞧瞧
Looky here.

482
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,207
给你零用钱 让你住大饭店时给服务生小费
Pocket change, in case you wanna tip the valet when you're at the Ritz.

483
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,174
这才像话，苏克在哪里？

484
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,711
在这里
Right here.

485
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,573
你要做什么？
What are you doing?

把袋子放下
Drop the bag.

487
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,581
你们休想离开
No one's going anywhere.

488
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,266
我告诉你K
Hey, yo.

489
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,308
你该知道，我不会背叛他们的
Just so you know, man, I'm not gonna roll on those guys.

490
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:51,141
如果你是为了这件事 我是不会说的K
It ain't gonna happen, so if that's what this is about...

我们之前聊过告解

492
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,549

我想我欠你一次道歉，因为我说谎

我从这里开枪射他
That's where I put the bullet in him.

499
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,987
这不关我的事
I don't care about none of this.

500
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:42,326
那次我做错了 因为鉴识组会查明真相
Mistake about that is that forensics will tell the whole tale.

501

我的枪抵在他头上 造成火药烫伤

接着全世界都会知道
