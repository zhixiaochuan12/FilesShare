The president is speaking there this afternoon.

296
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,730
-下午三点 -是他们拍影带六小时后
- Three o'clock. - Six hours from when they made the video.

297
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,301
他们要去找总统
They're going after the president.

298
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,536
（丹佛）

299
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,516
林克柏劳和迈克斯科菲尔德 两名逃犯所拍摄的影带
A tape made by escaped convicts Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield,,,

300
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,678
立刻被司法部称为毫无根据
,,, was immediately dismissed by the Justice Department as entirely baseless,,,

301
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,724
现在回到今天的新闻焦点
,,, which brings us back to the story we'll be continuing to follow throughout the day,

302
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,690
恐怖威胁指数已提升到橙色
Terror threat has been raised to orange,,,

303
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,798
几位阿拉伯裔美国人 承租的仓库忽然遭到查封K
,,, as a storage unit rented by several Arab-Americans was suddenly seized,

304
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,628
消息被封杀了 消息被湮灭无法上头条
They buried it. Dumped it off the front page and buried it.

305
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,030
这是他们的工作
It's what they do.

306
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,467
他们要怎么玩不重要 消息已经放出去了
They can spin it all they want. It's out there now.

307
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,733
假以时日 影带会有效果的
Give it time, the tape is gonna work.

308
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,969
-不能找到她，这也没用 -找到她还算简单
- This is a Hail Mary if we don't get to her. - Getting to her is easy.

309
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,343
-之后该怎么做才是难题 -所以要尽速找到她
- What we do after's the problem. - Which is why it has to happen quickly.

310
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,076
一旦被人发现我们找到她 就没戏唱了
Once anyone knows we have her, the curtain comes down.

311
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,115
-我去通知白宫取消K -不要
- I'll notify the White House to cancel... - No.

312
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,227
行程有一点变更 两兄弟会察觉，又藏匿起来
If there's a change, the brothers will know something's up and go back into hiding.

313
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,727
我们以前逮过他们 再抓到不是不可能
We've found them before. We can find them again.

314
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,661
他们不是宠物，卫勒探员
These are not pets, Agent Wheeler.

315
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,936
谢谢，这点我很清楚
Yeah, thanks. I'm pretty clear on that.

316
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,096
可是如果你要用总统当诱饵 绝对不可能K
But if you use the commander in chief as bait, that's not gonna...

317
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,742
你对我办案的方式有意见吗？
You have a problem with the way that I do things?

318
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,712
对
Yeah.

319
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:31,744
而且不只我一人
And I'm not the only one.

320
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,576
真的吗？
Is that right?

321
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,624
风纪部已经请我从现在起 呈报你一切的行动
Internal Affairs has asked me to run all your moves through them from here on out.

322
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,133
那么拿起你的笔
Then, get a pen...

323
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,798
一字不露的呈报回去
...and make sure you get this word for word.

324
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,840
总统的行程不会改变
The president's day does not change.

325
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,914
我们唯一的线索 就是知道他们的目的地
The only lead we have is that we know where these men are headed.

326
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,381
所以这件事不能泄漏出去
So we're gonna keep quiet about this...

327
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,810
等他们上钩
...and let them come.

328
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,887
现在滚出我的办公室
Now get out of my office.

329
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,789
全美已经有无数人认识他们俩
They're two of the most recognizable faces in America.

330
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,993
他们怎么会有办法 可以接近总统？
How do they think they're gonna get anywhere near the president?

331
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,263
因为现在不光只有他们两人
Because it's not just the two of them anymore.

332
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,600
我要去仔细研究这段影带
I'm gonna go take a closer look at that video.

333
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,405
长官，恕我直言，关于总统K
If I may, sir, the president...

334
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,413
你确定不要通知她这件事吗？
...are you certain we should keep her in the dark on this?

335
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,452
因为其实K
Because there is...

336
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,420
有个场合 她可以派上用场
...a scenario where she could be useful.

337
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:52,292
有危险的人的确是她，长官
It is her ass on the line, sir.

338
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,662
我想大家心知肚明
I think we're pretty clear...

339
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,530
以前危险逼近时 她都会自己采取行动
...she's been known to get her hands dirty when that line gets too close.

340
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,704
也许我们该让她知道K
Maybe we should let her know...

341
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,539
这次的危险有多近
...just how close it is.

342
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,715
身上没钱要旅行很困难
Travelling without money is difficult.

343
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,880
鸡肉好吃吗？

344
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,287
我妻子的比较好吃

345
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,555
她去世多久了？

346
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,952
一个礼拜

347
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,198
我很遗憾

348
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,667
你们结婚多久了？

349
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,074
42年

350
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,305
有什么秘Z吗？

351
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,707
你结婚了？

352
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,213
希望很快能结婚

353
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,746
结婚需要钱，你知道吧

354
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,925
谢谢你提醒我

355
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,854
你在逃离某些东西吗？

356
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,202
我在追求某种东西

357
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,334
你靠着希望苟活

358
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,673
你的口气似乎觉得这不是好事

359
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,607
脱离正道的人才会靠希望苟活

360
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,857
后面房间有一张床

361
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,186
谢谢

362
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,565
不，是我该谢谢你

363
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,971
孤独用餐是最凄惨的事 晚安

364
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,507
他们伪装空间的工作做得很彻底 没有倒影或反光
They did a good job masking the room. No reflections or flares.

365
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,673
声音特征，有教堂钟声 施工、车辆噪音之类的吗？
Audio markers: Church bells, construction, traffic. Anything?

366
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,014
空间音调显示他们在大空间里 约有10万立方尺
The room tone tells us they were in a large space, about 100,000 cubic feet.

367
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,520
所以摄影师的说法相符
So the kid with the camera, his story matches up.

368
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,023
我们确认了光线的时间
We clocked the quality of light with the time of day.

369
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,683
时间和地点都符合
It fits his wheres and whens.

370
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,089
好，说话内容
All right, content.

371
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,494
寻常的线索 眼睛、手、脚
The usual tells: Eyes, hands, feet.

372
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,134
柏劳有出庭划面 可以相互比对
Burrows, we're able to baseline off his trial footage...

373
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,293
所以他的部份更为清楚
...so we got even more clarity there.

374
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,535
我从福克斯河监狱逃出
I escaped from Fox River Penitentiary,,,

375
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,370
因为我被冠上莫须有的罪名而被判死刑
,,, because I was sentenced to death for a crime I did not commit,

376
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,377
-我没有谋杀戴伦斯史泰门 -这里
- I did not murder Terrence Steadman, - okay, there.

377
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,713
他的眼睛，有看到吗？
The eyes. See it?

378
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,544
眼睛往左飘，再往上
A slight shift to the left, then up.

379
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,381
对，这里的眨眼率 比习惯增加了
Yeah, the blink rate's up here verses the pattern.

380
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,524
他昨晚在卡特贝特旅馆自杀
He committed suicide last night in the cutback Motel,,,

381
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,660
离他在蒙大拿 布拉克富特的家30里处
,,,30 miles outside from his home in Blackfoot, Montana,

382
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,123
-他在说谎 -似乎是如此
- He's lying. - Seems so.

383
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,836
这里，柏劳双手交叉
Okay, here. Burrows, arms folded.

384
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,473
他在保护自己
He's protecting himself.

385
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,406
说这些话时他没有信心
Not a lot of confidence in these words.

386
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,374
用职务所需的理由搪塞
Like they happened in the line of duty,

387
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,746
他的话中有话
They mean something other than what he's saying.

388
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,484
他的姿势，缩肩膀的动作 有强调的意味
The posture. Shoulders in for emphasis.

389
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,554
他要你注意这部份
He wants your attention here.

390
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,153
这里
Okay, there.

391
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,728
-喉结 -放大划面
- Adam's apple. - Zoom in, zoom in.

392
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,556
看，他在吞口水
See? He's swallowing.

393
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,493
喉咙干燥，他说谎
Throat's dry. That's a lie.

394
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,328
-对 -他的动作非常典型
- Yeah. - His behavior is textbook.

395
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,335
如果影带能透露出 他们到丹佛的计划
If there's anything about what they plan on doing in Denver...

396
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,097
从他们身上一定查得出来
...they're gonna tell us.

397
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,073
-用那种方式说太真诚了 -当然真诚，这是实话
- Lf you say it that way, it plays too earnest. - Of course it will, it's the truth.

398
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,681
对，但说实话只会让他们办事轻松
But the truth sends them home to their wife and kids.

399
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,180
说谎他们才会继续追查
Lies will keep them busy.

400
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,444
我不要向全国说谎
I'm not telling a lie to the whole country.

401
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,021
-这是我们唯一的表达机会K -你要说什么我不在乎
- It's our one chance to say it how... - say whatever the hell you want.

402
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,682
说你是绿灯侠我也没差 我了解他们分析影像的手法
Tell them you're the Green Lantern. I know how they break down these tapes.

403
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,421
我有做过 每个小细节都是重点
I've done it. Every detail matters.

404
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,863
宝拉登的右腿跨在左腿上 和相反方向的涵义完全不同
Bin Laden crosses his legs right over left tells something different than left over right.

405
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,297
我们传达的目的不同
It's not the same message.

406
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,199
对他们都一样
To them, it is.

407
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,708
如果要让计划成功 你嘴里说的话
If you want this plan to work, whatever you say with your mouths...

408
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,776
要和你的眼睛和身体 传达出不同的涵义
...you need to say something different with your bodies and eyes.

409
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,311
眼睛往左上飘
Slightly up and to the left.

410
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,346
对
Yes.

411
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,544
另一个无辜的人也遭到责难K
Much blame has been placed on another innocent person,,,

412
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,555
总统车队进入市区 目前没见到两兄弟K
President's motorcade is rolling in. No sign of the brothers.

413
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,285
这里K 斯科菲尔德的手在做什么？
Right there. What's scofield doing with his hand?

414
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:54,054
我们已经给他们许多混淆的讯息 再添加一点如何？
We've been throwing them fastballs. What do you say we mix it up a little?

415
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,494
例如什么？
Like what?

416
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,996
我觉得是摩斯密码
I think it's Morse code.

417
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,263
-内容是什么？ -现在他说了一句话
- For what? - Well, right now, we got a phrase:

418
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,134
“水是温的”
"The water is warm."

419
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,099
知道是什么意思吗？
Any idea what that might mean?

420
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,109
-这有什么意义？ -没意义
- What the hell does that mean? - Nothing.

421
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,477
调查局要好一阵子 才会恍然大悟
It'll take the feds a while to figure out.

422
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,550
我们会派人去周遭的郡 调查水温
We have teams checking the surrounding counties for water temps.

423
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,085
对，可能是给共犯的讯息
Yeah, it might be a message to an accomplice.

424
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,589
该市有北波拉河贯穿，也许K
The North Platte River runs through the city. Maybe...

425
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,752
这话毫无意义 他们身边有个前特勤局探员
It doesn't mean anything. He's with an ex-secret service guy.

426
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,693
他们是刻意要我们 去查那些线索
They're spoon-feeding us every lead they want us to follow.

427
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,528
所以这是调虎离山 让他们去找总统
So this is a distraction while they go after the president.

428
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,795
他们一定早料到 我们会不信任影带
They had to know the tape would be discredited.

429
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,098
早料到我们会约谈摄影师
They had to know that we'd talk to the cameraman.

430
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,106
-背后一定事有蹊跷 -另一个无辜的人
- There's something else going on. - Much blame has been placed,,,

431
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,212
也遭到责难 莎拉丹奎迪医生
,,, on another innocent person, Dr, Sara Tancredi,

432
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,113
（密苏里州，堪萨斯市 珠尔葛罗图书馆）

433
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,011
莎拉，如果你在听的话
Sara, if you're listening,,,

434
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,345
我无法求你再给我一次机会
,,, I know I can't ask you for another chance,

435
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,053
我只希望现在 你已找到安全港
I only hope by now you've found your safe haven,

436
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,989
我利用了你 利用了你救世的天职
I took advantage of you, of your commitment to help others,,,

437
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,619
害你置身于所有医生的梦魇
,,, and put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare,

438
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:01,993
莎拉，如果你在听的话
Sara, if you're listening,,,

439
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,362
我无法求你再给我一次机会
,,, I know I can't ask you for another chance,

440
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,767
我只希望现在 你已找到安全港
I only hope by now you've found your safe haven,

441
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,473
我利用了你 利用了你救世的天职
I took advantage of you, of your commitment to help others,,,

442
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,740
害你置身于所有医生的梦魇
,,, and put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare,

443
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,314
利用了你救世的天职
,,, of your commitment to help others,,,

444
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,077
害你置身于所有医生的梦魇
,,, and put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare,

445
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,915
我想过许多道歉的方式 但我只能用一种
I've considered many ways to apologize, but I must arrive at one,

446
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,290
这里也是一样
It's more of the same here.

447
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,758
他的肢体语言有异 我看他的举止不是真心的
Body language, his tells. If you ask me, it doesn't look like he means this at all.

448
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,592
-我不在乎他的举止，再放 -我看不出K
- Don't care what it looks like. Play it. - I don't see how...

449
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,994
再放一次
Play it again.

450
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,901
我只希望现在 你已找到安全港
I only hope by now you've found your safe haven,

451
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,701
我利用了你 利用了你救世的天职
I took advantage of you, of your commitment to help others,,,

452
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,175
害你置身于所有医生的梦魇
,,, and put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare,,,,

453
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,337
他的声音，你不觉得他对她K
His voice. Would you say he sounds sincere...

454
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,348
说话的声音 是否比谈罪名的时候诚恳？
...when talking to her as opposed to talking about their crimes?

455
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,849
是可以这么说
I guess you could say that.

456
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,577
我是这么认为，你觉得呢？
I did say that. Would you say that?

457
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,723
我很希望能做不同的选择 但已经太迟了
I wish I could do this differently, but it's too late for that now,

458
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:03,054
-对 -对你和其他人都太迟了
- Yeah. - It's too late for you and for others,

459
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,456
人们被谋杀K
People murdered,,,,

460
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,030
这无关戴伦斯史泰门 也无关他们的清白
This isn't about Terrence steadman and it's not about their innocence.

461
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,133
-什么？ -他们不想找总统
- What? - They're not after the president.

462
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,600
他们在找那个医生 把莎拉丹奎迪的一切资料都给我
They're going after the doctor. I want everything we got on sara Tancredi.

463
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,295
亲友、笔友
Friends, families, pen pals.

464
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,840
就算是写感谢卡给她的人 都要查出下落
If anybody wrote her a thank-you note, I wanna know where the hell they are.

465
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,272
立刻办
Now!

466
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,335
你们在哪里找到他的？

467
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,846
镇外，他在15号公路往南走

468
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,981
我们认出你的车，但不认识他

469
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,152
我懂了

470
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,316
很高兴你们带他回来

471
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,791
我忘了给他加油的钱

472
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,933
所以你真的把车借给他

473
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,010
真抱歉

474
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,010
需要警察把你的车开回来吗？

475
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,812
没关系，离这里不远

476
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,653
他自己可以走

477
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,305
找到你的女孩

478
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,306
再找回你的正道

479
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,424
莎拉丹奎迪，父母双亡
Sara Tancredi. Dad dead, mom dead.

480
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,663
电子邮件信箱联络人非常少 也很少使用
E-mail account shows a minimal list of contacts, with very little activity.

481
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,435
信用卡多半用来买杂货 偶而会买衣服
Credit cards used mostly for groceries, sporadic clothing shopping...

482
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,340
以及单人电影票
...and the purchase of single movie tickets.

483
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,844
还有妇产科记录显示K
And ob-gyn records tell us...

484
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,075
近来她几乎没有性生活
...she's had very little in the way of sexual relationships recently.

485
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,618
老实说 我想她生活中只有工作
Tell you the truth, I would say the bulk of her life was her work.

486
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,300
长官，你要去哪里？
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

487
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,482
（清洁工陈尸于 蒙大拿汽车旅馆）

488
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,987
（逃犯留下尸体）

489
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,884
看来我们只除掉了清洁工
Apparently, we took out a janitor.

490
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,622
等搞垮他们，一切都会水落石出
When it all comes down, all of this will get cleared up.

491
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,993
没有莎拉，就不可能搞垮他们
Well, it ain't coming down if we don't get sara.

492
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,600
她会来的
She'll be here.

493
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,428
我要和我弟弟谈谈
I wanna speak to my brother.

494
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,768
我们得开始想她不来时的对策
We gotta start thinking about what to do if she doesn't show.

495
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,606
或是她来之后的对策
Or if she does.

496
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,378
万一这家伙帮助我们K
What if the only reason this guy's helping us...

497
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,746
只为了取得莎拉手上的资讯 怎么办？
...is to get whatever information sara has?

498
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,990
如果这只是个大陷阱怎么办？
What if this is just one giant setup?

499
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,199
晚安
Well, good night.

500
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,051
你也该回家了
About time you come home.

501
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,482
你又跟姓非塔克的 小子出去？
You out with that Feytek boy again?

502
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,457
-莎夏 -走开
- Sasha. - No!

503
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,893
你也许长得像我
You may look like me...

504
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,701
但找男人方面是遗传你妈 你说是吧？
...but you take after your mom when it comes to the boys, now, don't you?

505
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,701
希望我的品味比她好一点
Hopefully, with a little better taste.

506
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,971
该死，你最好对我尊敬一点
Damn it, girl, you are gonna show me some respect.

507
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,919
-我知道莎拉的朋友不多 -她喜欢独来独往
- I know sara didn't have many friends. - She's sort of a Ioner.

508
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,324
你是她的朋友
But you were her friend.

509
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,598
我希望是的
I like to think so, yes.

510
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,326
但你不知道她现在的下落？
But you have no idea where she is now?

511
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,298
不知道
No.

512
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,531
这是那两兄弟的影带对话内容
This is a transcript of the scofield-Burrows videotape.

513
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,574
我把他对莎拉说的话标示出来
I highlighted the part where he talks directly to sara.

514
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,841
你有看出什么吗？
Mean anything to you?

515
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,942
没有
No.

516
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,677
你不知道她和他会面的地点 如果他有这打算的话？
You have no idea where she might meet him, if that's his plan?

517
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,878
不知道
No.

518
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,582
布拉德贝里克还在医务室吗？
Is Brad Bellick still here in the infirmary?

519
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,355
对，怎么了？
Yeah. Why?

520
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,122
你现在一定在窃笑
You must be loving this.

521
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,792
我不是大老远来幸灾乐祸的
I didn't drive all this way to gloat.

522
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,936
那你到底是来做什么？
Well, then, what the hell you come here for?

523
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,069
首先，我得向你致敬
First, I really gotta tip my cap to you.

524
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,236
你追查逃犯的能力 比我的属下厉害多了
You've managed to draw a bead on the convicts than my own staff.

525
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,813
感谢你的赞许
Well, thanks for the "attaboy."

526
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,918
但如你所见 惩治体系并不以为然
But as you can see, the correctional system doesn't share your gratitude.

527
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,445
我不会占用你太多时间 但是我有几个疑问
I won't take much of your time. I have a few questions.

528
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,147
-什么事？ -莎拉丹奎迪
- About? - Sara Tancredi.

529
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,260
她来这里应征的履历上 把你列为推荐人
She listed you as a reference on her job application to work here.

530
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,191
你跟她很熟吗？
You know her well?

531
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,500
如果你能把我调到单人牢房 我就会跟她很熟
I'd know her a lot better if you can get my ass moved to ad seg.

532
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,332
我无法影响惩治局，你很清楚的
I have no influence with the DoC. You know that.

533
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,841
想请我帮忙，你就得想办法
You want my help, you do.

534
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,372
我可以找典狱长想想办法
I'll talk to the warden, see what I can do.

535
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,447
不过你要先给我答案
Right after you give me some answers.

536
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,813
斯科菲尔德喜欢用暗号 传讯息给莎拉
Scofield likes to communicate with sara via coded message.

537
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,613
你有任何部份感到熟悉吗？
You recognize anything here?

538
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,155
是否看得出 他想告诉她什么？
Anything that he may be trying to tell her?

539
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,021
看不出来，他只是在道歉
No. I mean, he's saying he's sorry.

540
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,790
但道歉对高傲医生 又有什么用？
Not that that's gonna do any good with Dr. Cold shoulder.

541
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,591
不过K
But...

542
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,867
怎么了？
What?

543
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,601
单人牢房
Ad seg.

544
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,643
好
Yeah.

545
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,040
你看这里
You see here?

546
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,619
他提到“再一次机会” 和“安全港”
Where it says this stuff about "another chance" and "safe haven"?

547
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,518
-应该是出自那一本“圣经” -什么圣经？
- That's out of the Big Book. - What big book?

548
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:16,421
戒酒无名会 莎拉还在戒毒当中
Alcoholics Anonymous. Sara's in recovery.

549
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,061
对，这我知道
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

550
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,220
这些是戒酒无名会使用的K
Those are the names of some of the chapters...

551
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,263
书籍里的章节名称
...in the book they use in AA.

552
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,731
你手上有戒酒匿名会的书吗？
Do you have a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous book?

553
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,468
莎拉，如果你在听的话
Sara, if you're listening,,,

554
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,472
我无法求你 再给我一次机会
,,, I know I can't ask you for another chance,

555
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,634
（再一次机会）

556
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,813
我只希望现在 你已找到安全港
I can only hope by now you've found your safe haven,

557
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,679
（安全港）

558
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,182
我利用了你 利用你救世的天职
I took advantage of you, of your commitment to help others,

559
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,393
我害你置身于 所有医生的梦魇
I put you in a place that's every doctor's nightmare,

560
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,394
（鲍伯医生的梦魇）

561
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,089
（俄亥俄州亚克朗的 圣汤犸斯医院）

562
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,033
我想过许多道歉的方式 但我只能用一种
I've considered many ways to apologize, but I must arrive at one,

563
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:04,402
（圣汤犸斯医院）
- It's getting late. - I know.

564
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,704
-不早了 -我知道
She's not here.

565
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,105
她不在这里

566
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,338
我也知道
I know that too.

567
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,740
她可能没看懂我的讯息
There is a chance she didn't get the message.

568
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,613
或是她受够这一切了
Or maybe she's just sick of all this.

569
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,777
这女孩在希拉甩了你
I mean, the girl bailed on you back in Gila.

570
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,856
你为何还认为这次她会赶来？
What makes you think she's gonna come running back now?

571
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,924
就是过去三个月 让我们继续走下去的东西
The same thing that's been keeping us going for the last three months.

572

Michael Crane. I think you've got a phone call for me.

585
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,391
拿去吧
Here you go.

586
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,566
谢谢
Thank you.

587
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,600
我是鹤先生
This is Mr. Crane.

588
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,012
这名字比纸鹤先生好听
It sounded better than origami.

589
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,349
即使你猜出讯息 我也不确定你会回应
Even if you got the message, I wasn't sure you'd respond.

590
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,816
我来不及赶过去 只能想到这种办法
I couldn't get to you in time. This is the only thing I could think of.

591
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,988
我发过誓不再烦你
I swore I'd leave you alone...

592
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,455
可是我非得联络你不可
...but I had to contact you.

593
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,194
因为我手上有资讯？
Because I have something?

594
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,390
你怎么知道？
How'd you know?

595
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,322
迈克，我在希拉原本要回去找你
Michael, back in Gila, I was coming back to you,

596
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,396
但有人把我抓走K
somebody grabbed me...

597
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,837
他们说我父亲 把某样东西交给我
...and they told me that my father had given me something.

598
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,000
他们有伤害你吗？
Did someone hurt you?

599
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,806
我逃走了K
I got away,

600
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,515
迈克，我不想再这样继续下去了
Michael, I want for this to be over.

601
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,781
我也是
That makes two of us.

602
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,917
你认为有可能吗？
Do you think that's possible?

603
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,190
有你的帮忙就有可能
With your help, yes.

604
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,799
现在都要靠 你父亲给你的东西
It's just a question of looking at whatever it is your father gave you.

605
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,434
那只是K
It's just...

606
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,501
只是一把钥匙
It's just a key.

607
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,231
我们可以查清楚
Well, we'll figure it out.

608
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,436
一起查
Together.

609
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,646
这句话很动听
I like the sound of that.

610
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,743
我也觉得
Me too.

611
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,904
你好，保罗
Hello, Paul,

612
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,006
总统女士，好久不见
Madame President, it's been a while.

613

我知道，我是打来道歉的
I know, I'm calling to apologize,

614

好
okay.

615
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,417
我非常抱歉 情况实在太复杂
I'm so sorry, It all just got away from me,

616
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:08,752
最后我却伤害到 唯一永远支持我的人
And I ended up hurting the one person who's always been at my side,

617
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,689
我要你回家，保罗
I want you to come home, Paul,

618
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,954
我们一起把事情解决
We can fix this together,

619
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,893
但不能让这两兄弟K
But not with those brothers,,,

620
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,695
流窜全国 破坏你帮我建立的地位
,,, running around the country, tearing down the very office you helped me build,

621
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,066
卡洛琳K
Caroline.

622
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,968
我希望弥补你
I want to make it up to you,

623
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,768
请你逮捕他们，保罗
Please bring them in, Paul,,,

624
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,379
之后一切就能恢复原状
,,, and everything can go back to the way it was,

625
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,981
我得走了，我们回头见
I have to go now, I'll see you soon,

626
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,393
你跟莎拉通上话了？
Did you talk to sara?

627
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,892
几天之后，无论如何 一切都会结束
In a few days, this should all be over, one way or the other.

我绝对同意
