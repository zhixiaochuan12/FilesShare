证人无法到场

证人无法到场是因为 他是在逃亡的通缉犯
The witness is only unavailable because he's a fugitive on the run.

118
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,649
就算如此，他在影带里的自白 证明丹奎迪医生是清白的

我不在乎
I don't care.

133
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,902
等拿到钱，他说出犸丽的 下落后，我就要杀了他
Once we get the money and he tells me where Maricruz is I'm gonna kill him.

外面的世界跟里面 没什么两样
Because the same rules apply out here.

139
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,318
不管你是不是有罪都一样
It doesn't make a difference if you're guilty or innocent.

140

141
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,425
那浑蛋把我的女友 抓去关起来
That son of a bitch took my girl and locked her up.

我现在还留在此地 唯一的理由
Only reason I'm not five miles away from here...

145
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,559
是我想帮你找犸丽 而不是杀贝里克
...is because I wanna help you find Maricruz, not kill Bellick.

146
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:55,104
如果你有这种打算 我就走人

相信我，我能体会 想扣下板机的冲动
Believe me, I understand the impulse to pull the trigger.

You're done.

你的枪伤 还没痊愈对吧，曼宏？
Those bullet holes don't heal too good, do they, Mahone?

166

把手铐丢给我
Toss me the handcuffs.

你们是美国人吗？

感谢老天，你们知道 瓜达鲁普大教堂在哪里吗？

你们有没有 旅游导览之类的东西？
I was wondering if you had a travel guide or something on you?

175
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,433
请你走开好吗，老兄？
Why don't you just keep on walking?

176
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,075
还真是抱歉，我还以为 美国同胞会互相帮忙
Well, excuse me for thinking I could ask for a little help from some fellow Americans.

西奥多包威 才是杀死那马子的凶手
Theodore Bagwell. He's the one you want for that dead chick in there.

看来你最近交了新朋友

235
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,938
-我听不懂 -刚刚那场骗局
- I don't follow. - That little setup back there.

236
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,239
有点超出你的能力范围
It's a little out of your league.

237
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,843
几乎是专家的手法
Looked almost professional.

238
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,808
假设是如此 你有多想知道真相？
Let's say that's the case. What's it worth to you to find out, huh?

239
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,248
因为我是知道一些资讯
Because I am in possession of some information...

240
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,284
你可能会需要，帅哥
...that you might need, pretty.

241
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,221
好，知道的告诉我 我也许会让你走
Okay, tell me what you know. Maybe I'll let you walk.

242
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,856
但钱别想带走
Without the money.

243
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,822
-是吗？ -对

244
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,630
-就这样让我大摇大摆地离开？ -要看你给我什么样的资讯
- You're gonna let me traipse on out of here. - Depends on the information.

245
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,626
是谁在幕后操控？
Who's pulling your strings?

246
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,902
我有预感你话中有话，帅哥
You know, I got a hunch you're speaking with a forked tongue, pretty.

247
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,407
不如这样，我们去公开场所
So I'm gonna tell you what. We go someplace public...

248
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,570
准备一辆车让我离开K
...with a car waiting for me to leave and then...

249
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,216
到时我再告诉你 成交吗？

250
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,979
不成交
No.

251
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,304
天啊
Oh, my God.

252
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,310
保罗
Paul.

253
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,953
这是我这辈子第二次K
That is only the second time...

254
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,450
遇到枪械卡弹的情况
...a weapon has ever jammed on me.

255
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,689
第一次是在 第一次波斯湾战争训练时
First time was during training for Gulf one.

256
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,027
一卡弹 指挥官就走到我面前说
And as soon as it happened, the C.o., he got in my face, and he said:

257
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,265
孩子，武器要是 在战场上卡弹K
"Son, a weapon jam on the battlefield.

258
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,637
还不如直接去自杀
You might as well call that suicide."

259
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,095
克莉丝汀，我K
Kristine, I've...

260
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,932
做了一些事K
...done things...

261
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,212
-该死 -我爱你，保罗
- Damn. - I love you, Paul.

262
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,852
不管你为何走到这一步
Whatever it is that got you here.

263
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,222
一定有出路的，相信我
And there's a way out, believe me.

264
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,090
我成年后整个人生K
My entire adult life...

265
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,191
都在听从命令
...I've followed orders.

266
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,894
我做了一些恐怖的事K
And I did terrible things...

267
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,300
因为我以为这么做是对的
...because I thought they were right.

268
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,336
结果特勤局期间我做的事 全都毫无意义
And it turns out I did those things in the service of nothing.

269
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,611
所以我现在就是这样 一无所有
So that's what I'm left with. Nothing.

270
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,245
你还有我啊
You have me.

271
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,746
好
Okay.

272
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,384
而你还有未来
And you have a clean slate.

273
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,458
可塑性很高的未来
Anything, everything.

274
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:23,097
-现在就可以重新来过 -我做了好多坏事，克莉丝汀
- It's available to you starting right now. - The things I've done, Kristine.

275
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,099
你可以悔改
Undo them.

276
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,529
保罗，总是会有出路的
Paul, there's always a way.

277
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,368
也许那把枪卡弹 是有原因的
Maybe that gun jammed for a reason.

278
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,137
过来
Come here.

279
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,398
别让自尊误了大局，帅哥
Don't let your pride get in the way now, pretty.

280
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,999
省省吧
Save it.

281
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,431
把我关起来对你毫无帮助
Locking me up ain't gonna help your situation none.

282
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,969
我有你要的资讯
I have information.

283
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,078
-该怎么做？ -带他去大使馆
- What's the plan? - We're gonna take him to the embassy.

284
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,446
确定他会被遣返出境 我们再去找贝里克，好吗？
We're gonna make sure he's deported. Then we'll go looking for Bellick, all right?

285
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,815
还有，我要你 和他一起坐后座
Meanwhile, I want you to ride in the back with him.

286
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,282
我说真的 你会因小失大
I'm telling you, you are being penny wise and pound foolish.

287
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,660
上车
Get in the car.

288
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:40,806
失大局K
Pound foolish, pound foolish, pound foolish.

289
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,907
我会告诉她 你们的条件
I'll tell her about the offer.

290
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,447
-如何？ -十二年
- Well? - Twelve years.

291
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,847
不K陪审团 听到迈克的自白了
No, no, the jury heard Michael's statement.

292
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,324
他们只听到一个逃犯 为了深爱的女人说谎
They heard a convicted felon lie for a woman that he clearly cares for.

293
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,520
他的话不足采信
He's got no credibility.

294
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,427
莎拉，我们必须认真考虑 检方开的条件
Sara, we need to take a hard look at what they're offering.

295
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,998
恕我直言，马提 坐牢的不是我们，是我
Due respect, Marty, we aren't going to prison, I am.

296
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,969
他们摆明了 要有人背负责任
They've made it clear that they want somebody to hang for this...

297
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,337
不幸地是 现在他们手上只逮到你一人
...and unfortunately, you're the only one they've got in their grasp.

298
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,738
躲不了的
There's no avoiding it.

299
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:19,614
这是认罪同意书 我们可以仔细解说给你听
This is the plea agreement. We can walk you through it if you'd like.

300
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,946
十二年？
Twelve years?

301
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,888
他没有回应
He ain't answering.

302
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,892
我很希望你弟弟 能回到船上
I certainly hope your brother makes it back to that boat.

303
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,867
如果他没回去呢？
And if he doesn't?

304
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,930
你该看看你自己
You should see yourself.

305
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,834
你活像在崩溃边缘一样
You look like you're hanging in there by a thread.

306
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,139
我只想尽快结束这一切
I just want this over with.

307
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,973
那你就不该来这里
Then you should never have come down here.

308
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,376
你应该知道，我和我弟 不会为了任何人放弃
In case you hadn't noticed, me and my brother don't quit for no one.

309
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,251
感谢老天你们不会
Thank God for that.

310
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:04,859
因为有你们这种人 我们这些人才会有工作
Because it's guys accused of things like you were that keep guys like me in business.

311
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:12,396
应该说 曾经让我有工作K
Kept guys like me in business, rather.

312
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,732
你不会有好下场的
It's gonna end bad for you, man.

313
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,334
世界上有些事我很拿手
A couple of things in this world I'm good at.

314
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,378
其中一项是我懂得 疲疚丧气的眼神是什么模样
One of them is looking into a man's eye and knowing when he's beat.

315
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,858
-大使馆还有多远？ -别急，兄弟
- How far to the embassy? - Just hang in there, buddy.

316
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,459
-到了之后呢？ -我们将他移送法办
- And then what? - We're gonna turn him in.

317
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,657
-我们要怎样不被逮到？ -到达之前，我会先停车
- And how do we not get busted? - Before we get there, I'll pull over.

318
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,235
我们用胶带把他绑起来 把他丢下车后离开
We'll hogtie him with duct tape, then we'll dump him out and hit the road...

319
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,134
我再报警 通知警方他在那里
...and I'll call the cops, tell them where we left him.

320
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,775
-要怎么找贝里克？ -别担心，会找到的
- How do we get to Bellick? - Don't worry, we'll find him.

321
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:56,004
-你们才不可能接近贝里克 -不关你的事
- Y'all ain't getting within a mile of Bellick. - Nobody asked you.

322
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,872
他说的有理，迈克
He's got a point though, Michael.

323
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,745
继续用枪指着他，可以吗？
Just keep the gun on him, okay?

324
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,252
如果贝里克被关起来 钱对他就没帮助了
I mean, if Bellick's locked up, what good's the money gonna be to him?

325
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,617
-我说会想办法的 -我的女友有生命危险
- We'll fix it. - My girl's life's on the line here.

326
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,259
-苏克，你最好振作K -天啊
- Sucre, you better pull it together... - oh, God.

327
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,750
救护车！救护车！

328
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,458
犸丽K
Maricruz.

329
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,865
放轻松K
Easy, easy.

330
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,701
-犸丽K -你不会有事的
- Maricruz, Maricruz. - You're gonna be all right.

331
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,261
把钱追回来，拜托
Go get the money, please.

332
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,991
过来！过来！

333
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,899
压住伤口
Pressure. Pressure.

334
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,953
你到底想要什么，帅哥？
What exactly is it that you want, pretty?

335
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,796
我要将你绳之以法
I'm turning you in.

336
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,873
真的就这样吗？
Is that it, really?

337
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,410
不是为了钱？ 如果是，你可以老实说
It ain't about the money? Because if it is, you can tell me.

338
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,479
这里只有我们两个罪犯
Ain't nobody here but us cons.

339
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,777
你可以乖乖就范 或是被我拖着离开
You can walk or get dragged...

340
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,476
自己决定
...but it's up to you.

341
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:28,289
不，知道吗？当你拿枪指着我 我多少还尊敬你
No, see, when you had the gun on me, I afforded you a certain respect.

342
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,793
但现在，掌控权在我手上
But here, well, the scales are tipped back my way.

343
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,422
所以该由我来说出 现在的选择
So I'm gonna spell out the present options.

344
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,263
我们可以把钱分掉K
Either we split this money...

345
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:44,136
你就可以在腿上刺青 或是随便你想干嘛
...and you can go get your legs tattooed, or whatever the hell it is that you want.

346
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,810
不然你的尸体 会被发现架在那把椅子上
Or they're gonna find your corpse over that chair...

347
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,415
裤子还被我脱下 因为我觊觎你很久了
...with your pants down around your ankles because it's been a long time coming.

348
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,992
好，你回答我了
Well, I got my answer.

349
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,397
等你废话说完就来吧
Whenever you're done yakking.

350
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,831
放马过来，贱人
Bring it, bitch.

351
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,363
你在骗谁啊？
Who are you fooling?

352
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:44,023
你不会杀我的，白面书生
You ain't gonna kill me, Mr. Michelangelo.

353
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,933
你没这胆量 不如我们就K
You ain't got it in you. So why don't we just let me...

354
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,174
好
All right.

355
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,487
好，莎拉
Okay, sara.

356
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,622
认罪的过程是这样的
Now, here's how the plea is going to go down.

357
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,530
法官会要你确认你的罪行
The judge is gonna need you to allocute to the charges.

358
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:22,230
他会问 你是否刻意不把门锁上
He's gonna ask you if you intentionally left the door open.

359
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,169
-你回答“是” -好
- You will say yes. - Right.

360
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,037
然后他会问你
And then he's gonna ask you:

361
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,543
你在迈克斯科菲尔德 和林克柏劳越狱之后
"Did you give support and comfort to Michael scofield and Lincoln Burrows...

362
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,774
是否有协助他们？“ 你回答”有
...since the escape?" You'll say yes.

363
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,646
接着法官会立刻判刑
And then the sentence will be immediately handed down.

364
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,488
检方要求让你去K
The prosecution is asking that you do your time...

365
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,954
保安最严密的监狱服刑
...in a maximum security facility.

366
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,527
我认为法官会同意
I think the judge is going to agree to that.

367
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,260
好
Okay.

368
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,971
如果表现良好K
With good behavior...

369
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,937
我要服刑多少年？
...how many years of my sentence can I expect to serve?

370
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,800
被判十二年K
On a 12-year sentence...

371
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,246
你得坐九年牢
...you'll do nine years.

372
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,276
四十岁之前可以出狱
I'll be out before I'm 40.

373
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,848
很抱歉，莎拉
I'm sorry, sara.

374
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,954
莎拉，有新消息
Sara, are you ready for this?

375
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,956
什么事？

有一个可信度很高的证人刚出面
A very credible witness has just come forward...

377
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,997
而且他愿意作证
...and he's willing to testify.

378
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,965
你所说的阴谋 他全部都可以证实
He'll corroborate everything you've said about this conspiracy.

379
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,570
是谁？
Who?

380
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,343
所有的小组注意

381
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,077
重复，受害者看到K

382
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:46,815
加害人往东北方逃逸 进入丛林里

383
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:51,621
大约在三号公路 第三十六里处

384
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:20,913
（克莉丝汀娜玫瑰号）

385
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,818

我有个朋友出车祸了
A friend of mine was in a car accident.

392
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,267

抱歉，我待会儿再打回去
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.

394
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,442
林克？

397
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,583
如果你敢碰我哥 你就死定了
If you touch my brother, you're a dead man.

398
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,157
拜托

00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,419
你不用担心这种事
You don't have to worry about that.

400
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,961
不过到紧要关头时K
But when it comes right down to it...

401
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,395
他跟你没有两样
,,, he's just like you,

402
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,834
他狠不下心杀人
He has a heart that won't kill a man.

403
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:50,142
把手铐给我，不然我发誓 我会轰掉你的脑袋
Give me the handcuffs, or I swear to God, I'll blow your head clean off.

404
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,796
你想怎样，亚历？
What do you want, Alex?

405
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,966
我会告诉你我想怎样 不过正事先办
I'll tell you exactly what I want. But first things first.

406
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,204
警方今天抓到 包威的时候
When the authorities captured Bagwell today...

407
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,377
那笔钱下落不明
...the money was nowhere to be found.

408
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,983
我只能猜想K
Now, I can only assume...

409
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,515
钱在你手上
...that you've got the money...

410
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:38,224
现在就在 克莉丝汀娜玫瑰号上
,,, aboard the Christina Rose right now,

411
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,728
绝妙的计划 拿了钱搭船，然后永远消失
It's an amazing plan. Take the money, take the boat and disappear forever.

412
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,836
可是不光只有你需要消失
But you are not the only one that needs to disappear.

413
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,941
-你还在吗？ -我还在
- Are you still there? - Yeah, I'm still here.

414
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,601
很好，因为这句话 我只说一遍
Good, Because I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna say this once:

415
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,414
把钱和船都交给我
Bring me the money, bring me the boat.

416
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,876
你疯了
You are out of your mind.

417
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,451
没有
Not really.

418
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,816
我们手上都有 对方需要的东西
We both have something the other person needs.

419
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,557
迈克，重点就是K
It all comes down to this, Michael:

420
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,056
用你的计划换你哥的命
Your brother for your plan,

421
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,422
我只给你五分钟考虑
Five minutes. That's what you have.
