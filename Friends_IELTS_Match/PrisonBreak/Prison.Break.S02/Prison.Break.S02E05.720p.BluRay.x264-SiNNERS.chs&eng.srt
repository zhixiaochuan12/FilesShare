没关系，现在没事
That's okay. It'll do for now.

If you wanna restore dignity, you need to take action,

146
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,776
若想要找回尊严 就必须付诸行动

147
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,246
赎罪不光是说句道歉就好
Making amends requires much more than saying, "I'm sorry,"

148
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,781
而是学习改变
It means learning to change.

149
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,549
道歉只是第一步骤
The apology's just the first step.

150
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,185
最重要的一点是 当你向人道歉时

必须展现诚意 勇气以及同理心
...courage and compassion when you extend your apologies.

152

-我有一个好主意 -什么？
- I got a great idea. - What's that?

155

Since you are such a fan of lame, store-bought blueberry pie...

I can't.

158
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,970
我现在应该只能和心理医生见面
I really don't need to be seeing anyone right now who isn't my therapist.

159
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,309
我最近也像个隐士
I've been a hermit lately too.

I've been sitting around every night by myself.

162
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,443
真的很可悲
Kind of pathetic.

163

It's disgusting. I realize that sounds like an excuse.

-但这是真的 -不K没关系
- It's not. - No, no, no, I get it.

Oh, well, hold on, now. That can't be right. That can't be right.

290
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,559
-借过一下 -好的

我真的K我现在身无分文
Seriously, I don't... I'm broke, okay?

293
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,741
我说的是实话
Now, that's the truth.

294
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,445
我不久前遇上了麻烦
Now, I just ran into some trouble a while back.

295
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,348
我现在很努力想振作起来 你懂吗？
I'm just trying to pull it all together now. You understand?

296
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,420
五分钟后 你可以把这些事告诉警方
Well, you can tell that to the authorities in about five minutes.

297
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,114
别这样，不需要通知警方K
Come on, brother, we don't have to get the authorities...

298
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,782
太迟了
It's too late.

299
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,894
他们已经在下一站等你
They're already waiting at the next stop.

300
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,395
这两位警员会陪你 直到下车为止
These guys here are gonna sit with you until we stop.

301
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,434
我了解K

他在爱达荷州普雷斯顿 跳下行进间的火车
He jumped out of a moving train in Preston, Idaho.

307

芝加哥黑人到爱达荷州做什么？ 他一定是迷路了
What is a black man from Chicago doing in Idaho? He's gotta be lost.

308
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,705

这两人从未跨越过密西西比
Both men have never been across the Mississippi.

310
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,480
要造访亲友吗？我可不认为
Visiting friends and family? I don't think so.

311
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,145
更何况他们不是前往南方边境
And not south of the border.

312
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:50,693
他们往西走，我们要查出原因
They're due west, and we need to know why.

313
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,288
下车

往大街去，他要去买铲子

我拿出枪，结果他跑上树
I pulled out my gun and... that bitch treed herself.

325
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,880
我一枪就把他打下来
And I brought her down in one shot.

326
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,248
-他有多重？ -上百磅
- What'd she weigh? - At least a hunny.

327
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,617
-应该有110磅 -有空来找我们
- Maybe 110. - Come on out and see us if you want.

328
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,227
-一定会很好玩 -好，我考虑一下
- It's gonna be a good time. - Yeah, I just might do that.

329

你打算挖什么？
Hey, now. What you digging?

330
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,105
我爷爷院子里的东西
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

331

我后面仓库有更大的，可以挖更深
I got a bigger one in the back if you're going deep.

332
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,176
不用，这支就好
No, this'll do.

333
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,744
你长得真眼熟
Damn it if I don't know you from somewhere.

334
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,448
也许我认识你爷爷
Maybe I know your grandpa.

335
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,887
不太可能，他一个月前才搬来
Doubt it, man. He moved here like a month ago so...

336
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,923
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

337
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:33,563
他叫爷爷，可以吗？ 可以结帐了吗？
His name's Grandpa, all right? Can you just ring this up?

Hey, hold on. Stay right there.

348
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,131
你跟你的伙伴完蛋了，浑蛋

You don't want her to marry Hector, do you? Do you?

364
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,532
我去看能不能找她来

你一定很难理解我为何会这么做
And it must be hard to understand why I did it.

401

我没想到我会让这些人越狱

我以为这么做是救无辜的生命

我知道我给你的 林克柏劳资料

我尊重这点 所以我会让她自己决定
Out of respect for that, I'm gonna let her make her own decision.

423
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,623
-我一定要带她走 -犸丽自己会决定
- I'm not leaving without her. - That's for Maricruz to decide.

424
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,158
-你一直对她洗脑 -她是聪明的女孩
- You've been filling her head with this crap. - She's a smart girl.

425
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,422
我个人认为她不会想过逃亡的生活
I personally don't think she's gonna wanna live her life on the run.

426
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,497
-等着瞧吧 -你知道她不爱你
- We'll see. - You know she doesn't love you.

427

医生会记录，所以我才和你交易

看之前的情况 我还以为我们的交易结束了

-你不问席尔斯的消息了 -那部份已经结束了

-不可能全都抓到 -我可以去打听K
- Can't get them all. - I can keep an ear out on the street...

We understand each other?

446
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,864

告诉我那不是地图
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

458
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,757
是地图没错，但别担心
It is. But don't worry.

459
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,386
被我毁掉前 我已经深深记在脑海里了
Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory.

460
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,295
你这大骗子说的话 我很难相信
Coming from a compulsive liar, I find that hard to believe.

461
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,835
原本我想纹在身上 可是时间不够
I'd have tattooed it to my body, but I didn't have the time.

462
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,973
替无期徒刑犯搜身时 绝对别忘了检查零钱包
Whenever you strip-search a lifer, you should always check his coin purse.

463
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,673
告诉我们钱在哪里
Tell us where the money is.

464
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,811
我们不必暴力相向，好吗？
Now, let's not dissolve into threats, all right?

465
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,418
我要大发慈悲 提出一项对双方都有利的建议
I'm gonna take the high road here. Suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement.

之后我们四人平分，对吗？
So then, yo, we split it four ways, right?
