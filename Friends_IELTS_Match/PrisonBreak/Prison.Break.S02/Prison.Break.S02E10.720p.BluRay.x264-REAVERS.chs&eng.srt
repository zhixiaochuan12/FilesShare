如果她回来，需要我做什么吗？

149

我安排了 我们去巴拿马的计划

明天我们去和我哥会合

152
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:57,218
和全美两大通缉犯 逃到巴拿马？

现在我们只有这条路可走

156
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,936
和欺骗我的男人一起远走高飞？

00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,637
你知道我会让茶包这种人 重获自由吗？
Did you know that I would be putting T-Bag back out onto the street?

159
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,215
这不在当初的计划之中
I never meant for that to happen.

160

我只是不能不这么做

他看起来喜欢嚼烟草

他是来取我的性命

292
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,991
-下场你我都很清楚 -反正丙烷会毒死我
- We both know what'll happen. - The propane will kill me anyway.

293
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,567
有差别吗？ 还不如现在就死
What difference does it make? Might as well do it now.

294
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,762
说的有理
That's a good point.

295
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,535
这就好了
There you go.

296
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,968
这样如何K
There. There!

297
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,637
这样你就有时间 思考你的行为
That'll give you time to think about what you're doing.

298
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,306
但首先我要建议你，放弃吧
But first, a word of advice. Stop.

299
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:06,314
因为当你一接近我 我总是获胜
Because when you get close, I will win every time.

300
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,052
你这么想？
You think?

301
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,593
-现在被关的人不是我 -是没错
- I'm not the one in a cage. - No, you're not.

302
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,860
你和我有个很大的差异，麦可
There's one big difference between you and I, Michael.

303
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,935
而你刚证实了这点
And you just proved it.

304
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,538
你无法杀人
You can't kill.

305
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,437
只有杀了我，我才会放弃
And that's what it's gonna take to stop me.

306
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,942
因为我不像你有顾忌
Because I don't have the same reservations.

307
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,807
我不能有
I can't.

308
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,975
所以不管是今天在希拉 或是明天在阿布奎基
So whether it's today in Gila or tomorrow in Albuquerque...

309
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,383
或是两个月后在巴拿马
...or two months from now in Panama...

310
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,324
我都会逮到你
...I will get you.

311
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,698
我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

312
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,254
我替我们争取到一些时间
I bought us some time.

313
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,758
-你没事吧？你流血了 -走吧
- You okay? You're bleeding. - Let's go.

314
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,692
系好安全带
Get your seatbelt.

315
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,995
（堪萨斯州，垂比云）

316
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,675
这里，804号
Here, 804.

317
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,284
滚开
Move.

318
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,802
这真是最美丽的景象，不是吗？
Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen?

319
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,909
一大笔钱
All that green.

320
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,644
比大峡谷还要壮观
It's prettier than the Grand Canyon.

321
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,475
罗伊，这是我俩 人生中的重要里程碑
You know, Roy, this is a monumental moment for both of us.

322
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,946
袋子交给我，布拉德
Hand over the bag, Bradley.

323
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,648
-把敲肉棒放下，老奶奶 -我可不是开玩笑的
- Put down the pounder, Grandma. - Hey, hey, I'm not kidding around.

324
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,221
你以为你这娘娘腔K
Oh, you think your pansy ass...?

325
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,761
下次你自己挖粪便吧
Next time, you pick through the crap.

326
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,236
好，有急救药品 抛弃式手机、两支牙刷
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones, a couple of toothbrushes.

327
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,635
汽车旅馆呢？
What about the motel?

328
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,306
旅馆计时收费，不检查证件
They charge by the hour, so they didn't ask for ID.

329
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,618
-钥匙在你手上？ -对
- Do you have the keys? - Yeah.

330
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,815
有带帽子吧？
Want your hat?

331
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,976
抱歉，我们不在家 哔声后请留言，我们会回电给你
Sorry, we're not home, Leave a message at the beep and we'll get back to you,

332
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,477
泰瑞莎 这通留言是给犸丽的
Theresa, this message is for Maricruz.

333
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,343
你打来的时候我在那里K
I was right there waiting for your call...

334
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,179
可是警察出现了，我不能接电话
...but the cops showed up and I couldn't pick up the phone.

335
00:35:55,353 --> 00:36:00,086
我知道这大概就是 你不想和我在一起的原因
I know probably that's the exact reason why you may not wanna be with me.

336
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,387
听我说
Listen to me.

337
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,859
我的伊戴拉斯阿姨 住在墨西哥市郊
My Aunt Idalyz, she lives outside Mexico City.

338
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,491
在山上的牧场中 那里有骆马让孩子骑
In the mountains, on a farm, with a Ilama for the baby to ride.

339
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,765
所以下周，等你飞回家
So next week, when you fly back home...

340
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,909
回到机场的时候 我会在那里
...when you go to the airport, I'll be there.

341
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,045
在伊斯塔帕机场等着你
In the airport, in lxtapa, waiting for you.

342
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,875
我用生命向你保证
I promise you, mi vida.

343
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,077
宝贝，我爱你胜过全世界
I love you, Mommy. I love you more than anything.

344
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,413
没有你我活不下去
And I can't live without you.

345
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:35,082
我知道有办法可以解决的，宝贝
I just know I can make it work, baby.

346
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,221
之后如果你遇到麻烦 这会有帮助
This is in case you run into trouble down the road.

347
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,626
我有个办法
I have a way.

348
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,032
（波修伊布斯）

349
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,905
-她在哪里？ -谁？
- Where is she? - Who?

350
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,542
犸丽，她不在家也没去上班
Maricruz. She wasn't at home. She's not at work.

351
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,144
她不在这，我不知道她去哪里
Well, she's not here. I don't know where she is.

352
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,975
你想惹麻烦吗？贱人 不准骗我
You trying to cause problems for me, bitch? Don't lie to me.

353
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,583
她去墨西哥了，对吧？
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

354
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,548
（墨西哥市 伊斯塔帕）
Went on our honeymoon.

355
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,092
去我们的蜜月旅行

356
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,029
用我的钱去旅行
Paid for with my money.

357
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,563
待会儿一定会很痛
This isn't gonna feel good.

358
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,537
我很耐痛，你清楚的
I have a high tolerance for pain. You know that.

359
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,199
的确
You do.

360
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,178
你不是糖尿病患者，对吧？
And you're not a diabetic, are you?

361
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,052
好了
Right.

362
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,888
麦可，告诉我
Michael, tell me something.

363
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,160
你对这一切 有感到一丝丝乐趣吗？
You think there's a part of you that enjoys this?

364
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,198
在伤口上擦双氧水？并不有趣
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

365
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,399
我是指越狱
I mean escaping from prison...

366
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,740
过逃亡的生活 危险、恐惧、匆促、这一切
...and being on the run and the danger and the fear and the rush. All that.

367
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,505
这K
It...

368
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,115
让我觉得你在寻求刺激
It feels to me like chasing a high.

369
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,993
我了解那种感受K
And I know what that's like...

370
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,560
现在我早该学到教训了
...and I should know better by now.

371
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,857
我从来没这么想过
I never thought about it like that.

372
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,536
我知道你以前听过K
I know you've heard this before...

373
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,111
但不会永远这样的
...but it won't always be like this.

374
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,214
根据你跟我说的每件事来看 只是越来越糟
From everything you've told me, it's getting worse.

375
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,010
他们不可能永远追捕我们
They can't chase us forever.

376
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,653
今天来追我们的家伙 只能追到边境
The guy who caught up with us today stops at the border.

377
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,914
所以我们一定要越过边境
That's why we have to get across.

378
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,217
我已安排好人帮助我们
I have the people in place to help us do that.

379
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,326
我们明天就会去和他们会合
We're meeting them tomorrow.

380
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,458
再等一天，莎拉
One more day, sara.

381
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,064
再等一天
One more day.

382
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,494
这是我唯一的请求
That's all I'm asking.

383
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,701
去清理一下
You can go get cleaned up.

384
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,400
伤口保持干燥
Keep this dry.

385
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,220
莎拉K
Sara...

386
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,356
我很高兴你来了
...I'm glad you came.

387
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,233
那么K
So...

388
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,869
就是他
...this is him.

389
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,947
小林克
Lincoln Junior.

390
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,880
-用你自己的名字命名 -我不打算叫他艾度
- Named him after yourself. - I wasn't gonna name him Aldo.

391
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,452
罗杰
L. J...

392
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,092
这位是你的祖父
...this is your grandfather...

393
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,728
艾度柏劳
...AIdo Burrows.

394
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,254
嘿
Hi.

395
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,664
我等了好久才等到这一刻
I've waited for this for a long time.

396
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,308
我已替你们俩安排好 安全的落脚地
I've arranged a safe place for both of you to go to.

397
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,013
感谢你救我们出来
Well, thanks for bailing us out...

398
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,619
不过我们要去找麦可
...but we gotta meet Michael.

399
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,352
他在哪里？
Where is he?

400
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,318
边境附近 有个叫波修伊布斯的地方
Down by the border. A place called Bolshoi Booze.

401
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,484
-我可以单独去接他 -不行
- I can go alone and get him. - No.

402
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,130
情势已经变了
Things are different.

403
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,893
我们掌握到证据
There's some evidence.

404
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,730
只需要再一点时间
We just need a little more time...

405
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,305
我们就可以把真相公诸于世
...and we can blow this whole thing wide open.

406
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,932
没时间了，我信任麦可 他计划让我们逃到巴拿马
There is no time. I trust Michael. He has a plan to get us to Panama.

407
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,942
你不了解，林克
You don't understand, Lincoln.

408
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,308
你们不需要逃到巴拿马
You don't need to go to Panama.

409
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,050
你们不用再逃亡了
You don't need to run anymore.

410
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,746
他在哪里？
Where is he?

411
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,257
我可以单独去接他
I can go alone to get him.

412
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,452
-告诉我好消息 -嘿
- Tell me good news, - Hey.

413
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,598
柏劳一家三代都在这里
I got Burrows. The trifecta.

414
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,197
-把他们处理掉 -史柯菲呢？
- Take care of them, - What about scofield?

415
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,529
-他们要去找他 -没关系
- They're gonna meet him. - It doesn't matter,

416
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,902
现在就下手
Do it now.

417
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,369
莎拉？
Sara?

418
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,854
（我已经学到教训，很抱歉K）

419
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,419
你好啊，莎拉
Hi, sara.
