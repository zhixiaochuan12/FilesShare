00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,816
他的确是个封闭的人 但是他以前不是这样的
He's a closed book, all right. But he wasn't always like that.

290
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,221
我们结婚前几年
In the first few years of our marriage...

291
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,261
他其实很浪漫
...he was actually romantic.

292
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:11,962
然后有一天，他忽然K
And then one day, out of nowhere...

293
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:19,001
-忽然怎么了？ -一切都变了
- out of nowhere, what? - Everything changed.

294
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:23,307
-他开始想尽办法离开 -离开婚姻？
- He became obsessed with getting out. - Out of the marriage?

295
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,177
他想离婚
Getting out of the marriage.

296
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,944
想把我赶出房子，赶出他的生活
Getting me out of the house, out of his life.

297
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,281
他就这样离开我
He left me.

298
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,424
丢下我们俩
He left the both of us.

299
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,292
你说他让你害怕，为什么？
You said you were scared of him. Why is that?

300
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,158
他开始出现怪异行为
He started acting strange.

301
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,269
无时无刻待在后院做园艺
Started spending all of his time in the backyard gardening, of all things.

302
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,904
他原本有洁癖
I mean, the man was a neat freak.

303
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,337
皮鞋要是刮到，他就会丢掉
He'd throw away a pair of shoes if they even got scuffed.

304
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,943
但是他却在后院 弄得全身肮脏
But he'd be out there, all covered in dirt...

305
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,445
身旁都是肥料和碱水
...and surrounded by these huge bags of fertilizer and lye.

306
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,313
后院才刚铺上草皮 他却挖开草皮K
We just put this new sod in, and he just tore it all up...

307
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,579
做了一个花圃出来
...and planted a flower bed.

308
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,620
有一次我到后院找他
And I went out back once to talk to him.

309
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,249
他却对我大喊
And he screamed at me...

310
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,091
叫我不准靠近花园
...and said not to come near the garden.

311
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,358
说那是他的花园
Said that it was his.

312
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,868
抱歉，你想的话 可以休息一下
I'm sorry. If you... If you wanna take a break.

313
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,273
我只想得到一个解释 他为何忽然放弃婚姻
All I wanted was an explanation why things ended so suddenly.

314
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,178
亚历只回答我K
And all Alex could say was:

315
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,944
“有些事是你无法掌控的”
"Sometimes things happen that are just out of your control."

316
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,001
（联络人，亚历曼宏）

317
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,612
你女儿房间那张照片
So the picture in your daughter's bedroom.

318
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,309
拍摄地点就在旋转木马，对吧？
The exact location where it was taken was a merry-go-round, right?

319
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,751
对
Yeah.

320
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,116
所以你只需要在旋转木马旁等待
All you have to do is wait by the merry-go-round.

321
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,625
班哲明会到那里等你
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

322
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,926
那有必要吗？
Is that necessary?

323
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,998
-班哲明甚至K -只是以防万一
- I mean, Benjamin's not even... - It's precautionary.

324
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:30,268
听着，我合作了 你们就别再来烦我和小孩
Look, I do this, you leave me and my child alone.

325
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,976
我向你保证
You have my word.

326
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,461
我妻子来了吗？
Is my wife there?

327
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,267
-她来了 -去带她吧
- Yeah, she's here. - Well, let's go get her,

328
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,919
三号，请确认你已到一号位置
Number three, please confirm you're in position, number one,

329
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:32,793
15秒后有台黑色吉普车 会停在停车场出口
In 15 seconds a black jeep is gonna pull up by the parking lot entrance.

330
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,199
冲上车
Run to it.

331
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,665
克里斯？
Chris?

332
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,445
快去
Go!

333
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,647
-不行，他们会带走蒂蒂 -不会的
- I can't, they're gonna take Dede. - No, they won't.

334
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,477
那男人在跟她说话？看清楚
Is that guy talking to her? Get a read on him.

335
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,179
-就位 -已经解决了，快去
- Move to positions, - It's taken care of. Go!

336
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,193
快去
Go!

337
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,267
她跑了K
She's running. She's running.

338
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,666
快，出动K
Go, go, go! Move, move!

339
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,744
上车，坐稳了
Get in! Hold on.

340
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,059
是2007年份的黑吉普车 没有车牌
It's a 2007 black Jeep. License plates have been removed.

341
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,101
正前往追赶K不！
We're in pursuit, headed... No!

342
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,979
把卡车开走K
Move the truck.

343
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,048
把卡车开走
Move the truck.

344
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,310
我叫你开走
I said move it!

345
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,284
-我女儿在哪里？ -拿去
- Where is my child? - Here.

346
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,923
-蒂蒂？ -是我，宝贝
- Dede? - Hey, it's me, baby.

347
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,391
我只是想告诉你 不会有事的
Hey, look, I just wanna tell you that everything is gonna be okay.

348
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,764
我们一家可以团聚，我保证
We're gonna be a family again, I promise you that.

349
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,168
蒂蒂在哪里？他说她在你那边
Where is Dede? He said that you had her!

350
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,898
不K宝贝，别激动
No, no, no, no, no. Be easy, baby.

351
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:21,034
冷静下来，崔现在正在学校接她出来
Be easy. Trey is picking her up from school right now.

352
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,439
蒂蒂富兰克林，道森小学 立刻把她从学校带走
Dede Franklin, Dawson Elementary. I want her pulled from school, now.

353
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,579
-出了什么事？ -校方说她在考试
- What the hell is going on, man? - They say she's taking a test, man.

354
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,552
但我觉得是在拖延
But I think they're stalling.

355
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,793
关于奥斯卡席尔斯呢？
What about oscar shales?

356
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,833
奥斯卡席尔斯？为何问起他？
Oscar shales? Why is he important?

357
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,977
他是少数逃出 你前夫手掌心的K
Well, he's just the only fugitive to ever successfully elude...

358
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,702
逃犯之一
...your ex-husband.

359
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,541
亚历一心只想追捕他
Alex was consumed with finding him.

360
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,947
毕竟席尔斯对受害者如此残暴 这能怪他吗？
I mean, after what shales did to all of his victims, who could blame him?

361
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,316
他有一整年只查这个案子
It was all he worked on, all he did for a year.

362
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,849
可是我不认为亚历的怪异举止
But I don't think that it was the stress of chasing shales...

363
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,290
要归咎于追捕席尔斯的庞大压力
...that caused Alex to start behaving erratically.

364
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,895
为什么？
Why is that?

365
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,964
因为亚历在线索消失后才改变
Because Alex changed after the trail went cold.

366
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,459
我记得很清楚，仿佛是昨日
I remember it like it was yesterday.

367
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:23,404
他走进厨房里 当时我们结婚已经12年
He just walked into the kitchen, after 12 years of marriage...

368
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,871
他说要我立刻离开那幢房子
...and says that he wanted me out of the house immediately.

369
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,907
我永远忘不了那天
I'll never forget the date.

370
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,242
6月15号
It was June 15th.

371
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,380
我想访谈可以结束了
I think I have everything I need.

372
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,012
可是你还没问到人际关系和教育背景
You didn't even ask about social history or education.

373
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,819
-调查一般都会问到 -那部份已经调查完毕
- That's standard in these checks. - That's been handled.

374
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,896
我现在要尽快把报告 交给策略行动小组
I have to get these reports filed with strategic operations, AsAP.

375
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,091
-你是策略行动小组的人？ -调查都由他们负责
- You're with strategic operations? - They handle these checks.

376
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,969
911事件后就不是了 梅瑞克先生
Not since the 9/11 realignment, Mr. Merrick.

377
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,835
现在是由资讯长负责
The chief information officer does them now.

378
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,502
上次调查亚历的就是他们
They handled Alex's last check.

379
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,673
当探员晋升到你丈夫的阶级时
When an agent reaches a level as high as your ex-husband's...

380
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,181
策略行动小组就会再度接手
...s.o. Takes over... again.

381
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,918
都是拜官僚之赐，感谢你的咖啡
Bureaucracies. Thank you for the coffee.

382
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:22,023
听着，快把她带走
Look, just get her out of there.

383
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,596
他们来了
They're here.

384
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,733
不K
No, no, no, no.

385
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,468
-我们得走了 -别管了
- No, see, we gotta go. - Don't worry about it.

386
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,739
你去发动车子，快去
Just get the car started, all right? Go.

387
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,050
-爸爸 -宝贝
- Daddy! - Hey, baby.

388
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,326
-准备走了吗？ -要去哪里？
- You ready to go? - Where are we going?

389
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,796
-迪士尼乐园 -富兰克林先生，你不能K
- Disneyland. - Mr. Franklin, you can't...

390
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,401
-FBI，站住 -抓住他K
- FBI, stop! - Get him, get him!

391
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,207
快！我们走
Come on, let's go!

392
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,741
我们走，宝贝K
Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby.

393
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,606
开车K
Come on, go, go, go!

394
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,677
富兰克林带走小孩 我重复，富兰克林带走了小孩
Franklin has the child! Repeat, Franklin has the child!

395
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,753
晚安，贺兰德太太

你今晚真是美丽
Don't you look lovely this evening?

397
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,358
你不应该欺骗我 天啊，我竟然让你接近我的孩子
You should've told me what you were. My God, I let you near my children!

398
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,096
别以为我会忘记你家门前的模样
Don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

399
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:34,621
离路边远一点，你想被抓到吗？
Come on now, get away from the road. You wanna get caught?

400
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,996
我看到你在餐厅时 打量那些女孩
I saw you checking out those girls back at the diner.

401
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,507
-什么？ -少来了，从实招来

402
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,873
我只是想确定 她们没有盯着我们瞧
No, I was making sure they weren't staring at us.

403
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,208
什么，盯着她们的屁股吗？
With what, their asses?

404
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:55,207
巴拿马有很多美女 她们喜欢美国人
Beautiful girls in Panama. They love Americans.

405

很好
Cool.

够久了
Long enough.

408

-唐娜安萨米 -她是隔壁的小孩

-她比你K -比我大四岁吧？
- She was about... - Four years older than me?

413
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,941
你妈请她当你的法文家教
Your mom was paying her for French lessons.

414
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,104
她教得很好
Well, she earned the money.

00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,983
过来，离路边远一点
Come on. Away from the road.

If you've done anything to Pam.

434
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,962
-或是我儿子K -你我皆知，你的家人都没事
- Or my boy... - We both know your family's fine,

435
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,508
不过你的离开 让潘很难过
Although Pam did seem a little upset about you leaving,

436
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,837
话说回来，你别无选择不是吗？
But then, you had to, didn't you?

437
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,643
因为你不能让她发现
Because you couldn't let her find out,

438
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:18,583
-发现什么？ -奥斯卡席尔斯，你还记得吧？
- Find out about what? - Oscar Shales, you remember?

439
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,182
溜出你手掌心的逃犯
The one that got away.

440
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,320
只是他没跑太远，对吧？
Except he didn't get too far, did he?

441
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,726
-你的功力减退了，史柯菲 -也许
- You're slipping, scofield. - Maybe,

442
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,396
咱们试想一会儿
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

443
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,629
假装是我逮捕到席尔斯
Let's pretend I was the one who caught shales.

444
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,873
我想我没办法 把这疯子交给法庭审判
I don't think I could have just handed that psychopath over to the courts,

445
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,103
因为我耗费心思这么久 都抓不到他
Not after he had eluded me for so long,

446
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,748
让我很没面子
Made me look bad.

447
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,777
你在外逃亡太久了，小子
You've been out in the sun way too long, boy.

448
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,681
调查局的薪水不错
You Feds make a nice living,

449
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,482
但还不足以让你挖掉昂贵的草皮
But not so nice you go around tearing up expensive sod,

450
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,557
除非你打算挖洞
Not unless you had to do a little digging.

451
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,590
除非你要藏某样东西
Not unless you wanted to hide something.

452
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,596
或是某人
Or someone,

453
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,727
所以你才用碱水，对吧？
That's what all the lye was for, wasn't it?

454
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,334
因为碱水有两种
See, because there are two kinds of lye,

455
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,439
少量的第一种是园丁的最佳良伴
Small amounts of the first kind can be a gardener's best friend,

456
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,544
大袋的第二种 可用来分解尸体
And large bags of the other kind decomposes bodies.

457
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,907
你真该去写悬疑小说
Oh, you should write mystery novels.

458
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,639
我不知道你是怎么想的
I don't know about you,,,

459
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,376
但如果我把人埋在自家后院
...but if I buried someone in my own back yard...

460
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,556
我会随时想起这件事
,,, I'd think about it all the time,

461
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:32,524
我会想K 也许我应该把尸体移开
I'd think maybe I should move that body,

462
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,197
但我又想到
Then I'd remember,,,

463
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,667
DNA会渗进土壤里 所以即使尸体不见了
,,, that DNA leaches into soil, so even when the body was gone,,,

464
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,398
我灭尸的证据还是存在
...the proof of what I'd done would still be there.

465
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,200
我可以想像那种感受
I can imagine how it feels,

466
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,204
那种压力
The pressure,

467
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,611
无止境的恐惧
The constant fear.

468
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,081
是一般人是无法承受的
It's more than a man can bear.

469
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,489
我给你一个机会
I'm gonna give you a chance,

470
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,555
放弃追捕 让我和我的家人消失
Back off, let me and my family disappear.

471
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,762
我会以保守你的小秘密回报你
And in return, I'll keep your little secret,

472
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,507
听起来如何？
How does that sound?

473
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,143
像死囚的遗言
Like a dead man talking.

474
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,340
我知道你没料到 事情会演变成这样
I know it's not how you wanted this to play out,

475
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,447
可是有些事是你K
But sometimes things happen that are just...

476
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,048
无法掌控的
,,, out of your control,

477
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,083
这就是个例子
This is one of those times,

478
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,562
你自己保重
Take care of yourself.

479
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,599
我们稍后见了，麦可
I'll see you soon, Michael.

480
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:51,474
对了，麦可 我们可能会比你想像中更快见到面
Oh, and Michael, it just may be sooner than you think.

481
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,029
午觉睡得愉快吗？
Did you have a nice nap?

482
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,563
梦见翩翩起舞的12岁女孩？
Visions of 12-year-olds dancing in your head?

483
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:20,261
-你们私闯民宅 -这里没人住，天真小女孩
- You're trespassing. - Nobody lives here anymore, Goldilocks.

484
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,235
屋主似乎连夜搬走
Seems the owner hit the bricks...

485
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:26,103
就在她听说某人又重获自由时
...as soon as she heard a certain someone had re-entered society.

486
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,110
匆忙地搬走 有些家当甚至没有拿走
Left in a hurry too. Even left some stuff behind.

487
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:35,516
这里就是西奥多展现他 变态长才的地方
So this is where Theodore practiced "Pervert Knows Best."

488
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,148
这里是他一度 和家人吃晚餐的地方
This is where he had his family supper.

489
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,428
至于这里，我想K
And that, I believe...

490
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,963
就是你与贺兰德太太 表达爱意的地方
...is where you and Mrs. Hollander expressed your love.

491
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:53,227
告诉我，小泰迪 你会要她穿上童装
Tell me, little Teddy, did you make her wear Dr. Dentons...

492
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:57,170
手上拿着午餐盒 来让你感到兴奋吗？
...and hold a lunchbox to help you get all worked up?

493
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,837
布拉德，我不指望一个K
Bradley, I couldn't possibly expect...

494
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,946
还和妈妈同住的成年男子
...a grown man who still lives with his mama...

495
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,277
会了解爱情的奥妙
...to understand the machinations of love.

496
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,494
想知道我们如何找到你吗？
You want to know how we found you?

497
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,959
你寄了52封信到这个地址
Fifty-two mash notes sent by you to this address.

498
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:28,697
内容都是恳求贺兰德太太 和你这可悲的人复合
All of them begging Mrs. Hollander to take your white-trash ass back.

499
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,170
而每一封都被标上 “退回收信人”
And every one of them boomeranged to Fox River...

500
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,744
被退回监狱
...marked "Return To sender."

501
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,475
狱警看信时可真开心 对吧？葛瑞
The guards had a real laugh reading them, didn't we, Geary?

502
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,379
那当然
Oh, damn right, we did.

503
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:47,013
你这只爪看起来真凄惨，滑头
That is one mangy looking paw you got there, slick.

504
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,217
怎么了？童子军反击了？ 葛瑞
What happened, Boy scout fight back? Geary.

505
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,055
现在你要告诉我K
Now, you're gonna tell me...

506
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,720
威莫兰的钱藏在哪里
...where you stashed Westmoreland's money.

507
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,835
否则我会一针针 把你拆掉
Or I'm gonna pluck you like a chicken, stitch by stitch.

508
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,472
好吧，你们想知道钱在哪里？
Fine, you wanna know where the money is?

509
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,279
我昨晚在床上全部花在你妈妈身上了
I did spend a whole bunch of it last night on your mama.

510
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,781
答错了
Wrong answer.

511
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,505
过来，宝贝
Come on, baby.

512
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,578
你好吗K？
How are you?

513
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,077
没事吧？
You're good?

514
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,681
-没事 -她很好
- Yeah. - She's okay.

515
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,189
-宝贝K -什么事？
- Baby. - Yeah?

516
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,627
我们该怎么办？
What do we do now?

517
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,157
我们不用等太久
We didn't have to wait too long at all.

518
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,401
我们该怎么做？
What are we gonna do?

519
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,107
想办法上火车，走吧
Get a ticket on the train. Come on.

520
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,635
在这里等火车来
Just wait here until the train comes.

521
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,009
（离希拉73里）

522
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,916
对，我想就是他们两个
Yeah, I think that's the guy right over there.

523
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,932
两名白人男子徒步 从威考克车站逃逸
Two Caucasian males on foot, fleeing the Willcox station.

524
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,110
我在跑了
I'm running.

525
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,648
罗杰！
L. J!

526
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,593
-罗杰 -不准动
- L. J! - Hold it, right there.

527
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,663
-站住 -不准动
- Stop. - Don't move.

528
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,493
拜托K
Please, please.

529
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,794
-不关他的事 -趴下
- He's got nothing to do with this. - Face down!

530
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,903
-拜托 -快点
- Please. - Now!

531
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,374
上手铐
Cuff them.

532
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,473
罗杰，对不起
L.J., I'm sorry.

533

嫌犯已制服，疑似林克柏劳
Suspect in custody. Possible ID, Lincoln Burrows.

534
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:16,490
对不起，罗杰，对不起
