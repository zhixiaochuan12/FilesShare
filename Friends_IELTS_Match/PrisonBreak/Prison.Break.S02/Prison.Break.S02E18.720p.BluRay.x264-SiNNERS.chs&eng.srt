-谢谢你 -好，请稍等一下

-我帮你托运行李 -不，我要随身带着
- I'll check this bag for you. - Oh, no. It's coming with me.

434
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:45,577
先生，那已经远远超过 随身行李的重量限制
Sir, I know that bag is way over the weight limit for carryon.

435
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,715
三顿重的飞机在天上飞 多几磅又有何差别K
What difference does a few pounds make on a 3-ton aircraft whether it's up above...?

436
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,856
这会违反联邦航空总署规定
It's an FAA violation.

437
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,653
先生，你的行李会很安全的

438
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,302
今天风城的旅客 将有苦头吃了
Today will be a tough day for travelers in the Windy city,,,

439
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,742
因为卡莱尔大饭店 方圆六街区的路
,,, as all streets in a six-block radius of the Grand carlisle Hotel,,,

440
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,075
都已经被封锁，为的是
,,, have been closed to traffic in anticipation,,,

441
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,480
雷诺兹总统今晚将在 该饭店发表演说

442
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,554
这是总统到 中西部访问的其中一站

444
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,794
西奥，我知道你是新来的 但笔记纸两面都要用，懂吗？
Hey, Theo, I know you're new, but we use both sides of legal pads in this office, okay?

445
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,487
回收前，要先降低使用量
Before we recycle, we reduce.

446
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,929
卡曼其人善用整只水牛
The Comanche used the entire buffalo.

447
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,590
我们也要效法
So can we.

448
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,033
事实上 多数的族人会在农田耕作
Actually, majority of tribes would farm land...

449
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,174
直到土壤不再肥沃，他们就会E离
...till it was stripped of its fertility, then they'd just move on.

450
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:48,278
印度安人会保护资源 是自由主义白人内疚的迷思
The Indian as conservationist is a myth created by white liberal guilt.

451
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,347
-保罗 -你好，克莉丝汀
- Paul. - Hi, Kristine.

452
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,576
我以为在爸的葬礼上可以见到你
I'd hoped maybe I'd see you at Dad's funeral.

453

那个人在心跳停止前早就死了

455
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,522
-这么说不公平 -是实话
- That's really not fair. - It's true.

456

你想知道妈的近况吗？
So you wanna know how Mom is?

457

有人把你从胯间生出来 不代表她就是你母亲
Someone spitting you out of their crotch doesn't make them your mother.

458
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,723
那女人是疯子
That woman is insane.

459
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,835
你不记得？你都压抑在心里吗？
Do you remember? Have you suppressed it all?

460
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,029
我知道，保罗 我每天都要面对她，和你不一样
I know, Paul. I was there every day, unlike you.

461
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,073
-我面对她18年了 -然后你一声不响地离开
- I was there for 18 years. - And then you just left.

462
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,143
我才10岁，保罗
I was 10, Paul.

463
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,304
你是我唯一的家人，你却丢下我
You were all I had in the world, and you just left me there.

464
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,318
对不起
I'm sorry.

465
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,757
如果我有办法，我一定会带你走 而且我每天都想你
If I could've taken you with me, I would've, and I've thought about you every day.

466
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,960
我已经不是你记忆中的哥哥
I'm not the brother you remember.

467
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,533
我变了
I've changed...

468
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,801
变得K非常糟糕
...in a really bad way.

469
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,514
现在我已经分不清善恶了
To the point where I don't know what good or bad is anymore.

470
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,145
我要去做一件事 我非这么做不可
And I am gonna do something, I have to do something...

471
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,589
很多人将会认为我罪不可赦
...that a lot of people are gonna think is horrible.

472
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,161
-保罗 -我只要你记住
- Paul. - And you just remember...

473
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,993
和你一同长大的哥哥
...the brother you grew up with.

474
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,225
别忘了他
Just remember him.

475
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,300
你是我的妹妹，克莉丝汀，我爱你
You're my sister, Kristine. I love you.

476
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,877
我被打晕 我不知道他们往哪逃走
I was out cold. I don't know where they went.

477
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,580
是他们要你 在芝加哥市中心见面？
And it was their idea for you to meet them here in the middle of Chicago?

478
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,915
对
Yeah.

479
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,889
真是的
Oh, man.

480
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,402
-曼宏？ -你太慢通知我，他们逃走了
- Mahone? - You brought me in too late. They're gone.

481
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,338
-那就去找他们 -我想搞清楚
- Then find them. - Let me get this straight.

482
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,481
这两兄弟回到 离逃出的监狱15里外的城市
They come back to a city 15 miles from the prison they escaped from.

483
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,877
他们为何要这样？
Why would they do that?

484
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,577
也许因为总统要在芝加哥演说 他们另有计谋
Maybe because the president's in Chicago to make a speech, they're up to something.

485
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,381
所以我们要把他们揪出来
Which is why we need to find them.

486
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,384
有这么多人
And of all people...

487
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,186
他们却要见 检察总长办公室的人
...they wanna meet somebody from the attorney general's office.

488
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,891
重点是什么？
Your point?

489
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,459
柏劳是清白的
Burrows is innocent.

490
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,261
你真厉害，亚历 跟广告说的一样
You're good, Alex, as advertised.

491
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,668
没有人是真正清白的
No one's truly innocent.

492
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,205
这点你应该最清楚
You, of all people, should know that,

493
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,212
一定是接待员搞的鬼 我只和她说过话
It must've been the receptionist. She's the only one I spoke to.

494
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,524
迈克斯科菲尔德，这位是库柏葛林

495
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,184
我们得在宝宝来之前 尽量找机会做
We gotta get as much of that in as possible before the baby gets here.

496
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,054
为什么？
Why?

497
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,422
因为K
Because.

498
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,590
等宝宝越长越大 这样不是很怪吗？
Once the baby's growing in there, doesn't it just get kind of wrong?

499
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,031
也对
Oh, yeah.

500
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,801
-干嘛？ -我感觉到宝宝在动
- What? - I just felt the baby move.

501
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,174
-费南多，不可能的 -我很清楚感觉到了
- No, Fernando, that's impossible. - I know what I just felt.

502
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,216
医生说在某些行为后
Well, the doctor did say that he can become active...

503
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,284
他会变得比较好动
...after certain activities.

504
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,316
-你有感觉到吗？ -有，轻轻的震动
- Did you feel that? - Yeah, like a flutter?

505
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,291
震动才怪，他真强壮
Flutter, my ass. He's strong.

506
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,896
他要当国家足球队的队长
He's gonna be the captain of the national soccer team.

507
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,666
你有听到吗，小子？
You hear that, junior?

508
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,530
等你一出生 我就要给你一颗足球
Soon as you're born, I'm putting a soccer ball in your hands.

509
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,036
不行，要给他书本
No, he's gonna have books.

510
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,139
好吧

我们在荒凉的无人之处
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

515
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,584

抱歉，餐点什么时候上？ 我快饿死了

为了降低机票价钱

我知道，我当然原谅你

537
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:18,963
蒂蒂四岁的时候 她想看一卷录影带
You know, when Dede was like 4, she wanted to watch this video.

538
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,263
我一直跟她说，比赛转播完再看
And I kept telling her, you know, after the game.

539
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,634
比赛完再看好吗？
After the game, okay?

540
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,369
她一直不断地吵 我失去耐心，于是我骂了她
She kept asking and kept asking. I lost my patience and I snapped at her.

541

之后她走到角落
Well, she went over into the corner...

我甚至没有过去安慰她
...and I didn't even go over and say anything.

544

这么久以前的事

所有群众全程不得越过护栏
All spectators must remain behind the barricade at all times.

558
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,755
往南半条街上有炸弹客 组长要你去处理
We got a Boom Charlie half a block south. Team leader wants you there.

559
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,191
-是什么手法？ -是及时爆炸装置绑在K
- What's the M. O? - He's got an I.E.D. Strapped to...

560
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,494
他指定要你到这座喷水池？
He asked you to come to this fountain specifically?

561
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,139
对
Yeah.

562
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,509
公园地图借我看一下
Let me take a look at that park map.

563
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,012
为何不去公园东边的喷水池？
Why not the fountain on the east side of the park?

564
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,847
因为这座离公共电话比较近
Because this was closer to the payphone they called me at.

565
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,852
不，因为这座离他们比较近
No, because this one's closer to them.

566
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:23,092
他们要你去铜像见面 然后到喷水池
They tell you to meet them at the statue, then the fountain...

567
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,093
然后要你去公园对面的大楼
...then they send you to the building across the park.

568
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,089
为什么？
Why?

569
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,293
因为他们要让你 保持在视线范围内
Because they wanna keep you in their sights.

570
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,733
因为他们在监视你
Because they're watching you.

571
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,200
可是在哪里？ 铜像、喷水池、大楼
But from where? The statue, fountain, building.

572
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,312
那里，那间饭店
There. The hotel.

573
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,617
你知道它的份量吗？
You know what you have?

574
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,085
-我想我们很清楚 -你在干嘛？
- I think we have a pretty good idea. - What you doing?

575
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:56,352
寻找随身碟的独特资料 才能将它和其他随身碟区分
Getting unique data from the memory key so we can identify this key from any other...

576
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,462
再做标示 开始做证物管制链的纪录
...label it, start a proper record of the chain of custody...

577
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,655
好呈报给我信任的法官
...to present to the judges I trust.

578
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,322
好
Cool.

579
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,971
-可恶 -怎么了？
- No. - What's wrong?

580
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,405
是随身碟上的日期戳记
No, it's the date stamp on the memory key.

581
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,570
这是复制的时间
It's the copy date.

582
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,680
-抱歉，什么意思？ -这是档案复制的时间
- I'm sorry, what's that? - It's the date the damn thing was copied.

583
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,578
不是对话录音当时的日期
Not the date that the conversation was originally recorded.

584
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:23,852
那又如何？ 你自己也听过内容了
So what? I mean, you heard what was on the tape.

585
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,856
没有对话发生时机的 正确日期戳记
Without a time stamp of exactly when this conversation took place...

586
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,620
我们无法证明这段 戴伦斯史泰门的对话
...we can't prove that this is Terrence steadman talking...

587
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,957
是在你据称杀了他之后发生
...after you supposedly killed him.

588
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,861
这可能是他丧礼 一年前的谈话内容
This could've happened a year before his funeral.

589
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,467
既然无法鉴定真假
No, it can't be authenticated...

590
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,299
就无法呈堂证供
...so it can't be admitted to any court as evidence.

591
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,499
人们为了录音送命 我的家人因此死了
People died because of this. My family died.

592
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,171
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

593
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,214
在法律上来说 这段录音毫无用处
Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

594
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,756
-你好 -亚历山大曼宏，调查局
- Hi. - Alexander Mahone, FBI.

595
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,019
这两人有来住房吗？
Have either of these men checked in?

596
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,826
-我没有见过 -这个女人呢？
- Not that I've seen. - How about this woman?

597
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,393
有
Yeah.

598
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,003
1006房
Room 1006.

599
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,900
1006，谢谢
Ten-o-six. Ten-o-six. Thank you.

600
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,811
还没结束，就差这么一点了
It's not over. We're this close.

601
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,708
你已经说没救了
You've already said it's done.

602
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,339
事实上，我是说无法在法庭上 证明你无罪
Actually, I said it couldn't help exonerate you in a court of law.

603
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,049
它在法外或许还有帮助
Maybe it can help you outside the law.

604
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,650
怎么帮？
How?

605
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,688
我们都听过这段对话
Well, we all heard the conversation.

606
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,928
录音不只能证明林克的清白
There's more to this tape than potential proof of Lincoln's innocence.

607
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,222
更能证明卡洛琳雷诺兹的罪行
There is proof of Caroline Reynolds' guilt.

608
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,358
一个她不想让 任何人知道的罪行
Guilt about something she does not want anyone to know anything about.

609
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,401
所以我们要勒索她
So we blackmail her.

610
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,336
我是法务人员，不是我说的
I'm an officer of the court. I didn't say that.

611
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,479
勒索换取什么？
Blackmail in exchange for what?

612
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,676
总统大赦
A presidential pardon.

613
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:04,253
陷害我的女人 现在要她还我自由
So the woman that set me up is gonna set me free.

614
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,017
我认为她会亲自签字同意
I think she'll sign it with her own hand.

615
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,296
A、B小队，这里是1号队长
Ace Team, Beta Team, this is Leader One,

616
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,864
所有群众请勿跨越护栏
All spectators must remain behind the barricade.

617
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,325
总统即将抵达
The president will be arriving shortly.

618
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:22,029
总统将在两分钟内抵达基地
The president will reach Home Base in T-minus 2 minutes,

619
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,421
我爱你
I love you.
