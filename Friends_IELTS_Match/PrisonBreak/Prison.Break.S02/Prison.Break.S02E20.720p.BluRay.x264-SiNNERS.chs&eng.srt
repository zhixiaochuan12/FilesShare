147
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,245
只要他察觉我密告
So as soon as he finds out that I'm singing...

148
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,482
我大概连十八天都活不成
...I probably won't even last 18 days.

149
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,492
-富兰克林先生K -他威胁我的家人
- Mr. Franklin... - He threatened my family.

150
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,994
我必须在外面保护她们
Now, I need to be out there protecting them.

151
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:12,768
所以在你提供这种条件之前 休想叫我作证
So until you can offer me something like that, I'm not testifying to a damn thing.

152
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,670
警卫
Guard.

153
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,433
自由之身
Free man.

154
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,040
你和家人
You and your family.

155
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,678
证人保护，全新人生
Witness protection, fresh start.

156
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,117
-前科一笔勾消？ -干净溜溜
- Clean record? - Spick-and-span.

157
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,526
白纸黑字写出来 我就作证
You put that in writing and you got yourself a witness.

158
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,168
长官？
Sir?

159
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,404
我有敲门，但K
I knocked, but...

160
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,206
你没事吧？
You okay?

161
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,249
你觉得这像什么？这里
What does that look like to you? There, right there.

162
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,545
-一个三角型 -对，我之前也这么想
- It's a triangle. - Yeah, I thought so too.

163
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,749
这个呢？这里
How about this? Right there.

164
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,951
这是圆周率的数学记号
It's the mathematical symbol for pi.

165
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,256
三点一四 我猜是日期、区码
Three-point-one-four. I'm thinking date, area code.

166
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,662
三一四是密苏里 你认为斯科菲尔德在那里吗？
Three-one-four, that's Missouri. So you think scofield's there?

167
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,201
不太可能 你懂希腊字母吗，兰恩探员？
I doubt it. How's your Greek alphabet, Agent Lang?

168
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,237
我不确定，应该K
I don't know. I guess it's...

169
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,472
如果三角形其实是 第四个希腊字母，还有K
What if I told you that triangle was a delta? And that this...

170
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,614
这记号不是圆周率 而是字母呢？
This here was not the symbol pi, but the letter.

171
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,612
刺青的照片上没有这些记号
I didn't see those in the photos of the tattoos.

172
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,310
刺青上没有 这些是他原本的设计图
They weren't. We pulled these from his original sketches.

173
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,853
从硬碟上取得的
They're off the hard drive.

174
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,960
斯科菲尔德的逃亡计划有步骤 所以他才能掌控一切
Scofield numbered the steps of his escape. That's how he kept everything in order.

175
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:48,192
但看来他不是用数字 而是用字母，例如K
But it looks like that he didn't use numbers, that he used letters, like...

176
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,033
“艾伦施韦策”刺青的设计图
The sketch of this tattoo. Allen schweitzer.

177
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,798
标着第一个希腊字母 也就是计划第一步
Marked with an alpha, first letter of the Greek alphabet. First step in his plan.

178
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,034
第五个字母 计划中的第五步骤
Epsilon, fifth letter of the Greek alphabet. Fifth step in his plan.

179
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,236
还有第八、第十个字母
Here's theta, kappa.

180
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,643
这个，第十九个字母 到边境，对吧？
How about that? Tau. Be at the border, right?

181
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,785
-快结束了，还听得懂吗？ -所以你认为K
- Getting closer to the end. You with me? - So you think...

182
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,180
他的第二十四个字母
His omega.

183
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,949
-希腊字母最后一个 -就是他计划的最终步骤
- The last letter of the Greek alphabet... - Is the last step of his plan.

184
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,552
这是什么？花里的耶稣？
What is that? Christ in a flower?

185
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,890
-玫瑰 -还有数字，六一七
- Rose. - And these numbers, 617.

186
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,157
可能是圣经，第六章十七节
Could be biblical. Chapter six, verse 17.

187
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,961
六一七，六月十七号
Six-one-seven, 617. June 17th.

188
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,303
-今天几号？ -十五号
- Oh, what's today? - Fifteenth.

189
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,772
-所以不管最终步骤是什么 -就在两天之后
- So whatever his last step is... - It's gonna happen in two days.

190
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,546
（墨西哥市，墨西哥观光局）

191
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,317
我们的资料里没有史戴摩先生

192
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,818
你应该去问公车和租车公司

193
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,889
-他说什么？ -没什么，跟其他人一样
- What's he saying? - Nothing, the same as the rest.

194
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,152
也许他不了解 移民局的西班牙文怎么说？
Maybe he don't comprende, What's spanish for INs?

195
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,126
别傻了，这里是墨西哥 犯法的人是你
Don't be stupid. We're in Mexico. You're the illegal one here.

196
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:56,166
这不代表他没有家人在美国 正想尽办法弄张绿卡
It doesn't mean he ain't got family up north trying to clean their way to a green card.

197
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,166
他很清楚我在说什么
He knows what I'm talking about.

198
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,429
我讨厌这美国佬

199
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,165
可是我需要他

200
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,272
我的女友和孩子遇上麻烦

201
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,438
我们要找的这个人K

202
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,606
只有他能够救我的家人

203
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,617
他用E史戴摩这个名字

204
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,523
拜托，如果你有消息

205
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,454
请打这支电话

206
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,094

你对我真好，小苏珊

不，泰迪熊 幸运的人是我

我就重生了
...was the day I was born.

-时间到了 -不，苏珊
- We're out of time. - No, susan.

215

我们有一生的时间共享
We got our whole lives together.

216

不，我是说时间到了
No, I mean the hour is up.

217
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,183
我会好好犒赏你好吗？
I'll take care of you plenty, okay?

218

既然都到这地步了 让我们继续吧
It's just, we're rolling here, so let's, you know, get back.

219

你想干嘛，美女？
How's the... What's cooking, good-Iooking?

220
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,021
我真的觉得 你事先付钱会比较好
I would really feel better if you paid me up-front.

221
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,993
我已经先告诉你 如果你听我的，我就会犒赏你
I told you up-front that if you did this right, I would take care of you, so...

222
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,831
你付了一小时的钱
You paid me for an hour.

一小时到了
The hour's up.

如果要我留下 我要更多钱
If you want me to stay, I need more money.

225

太好了 气氛被你毁了，感谢
Great. Great, you ruined it. Thanks.

226

我刚刚还认为 “这马子挺聪明的”
You know, for a second, I was like, "This chick has a brain in her head."

227
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,308
不过如果属实 你就不会当妓女了，对吧？
Then, if you did, you wouldn't be a street whore, right?

228
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,120
我不认识小苏珊这贱人
You know, I don't know who this suzy-Q bitch is...

229

但难怪她不想和你有瓜葛
...but no wonder she wants nothing to do with you.

230
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,696
你刚刚骂她贱人？
You didn't just call her a bitch, did you?

231
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,364
好吧
Okay.

00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,389
把耶稣比喻成玫瑰 是《圣经》持续出现的一个主题
Christ as a rose. It's a common theme that runs through the Bible.

马丁路德将它用作教派的教徽
Martin Luther adopted it, his coat of arms.

244
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,924
还有对耶稣死而复生的信仰
And there's a belief that Christ rose from the dead.

245
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:14,532
既然这是斯科菲尔德的最后一步 代表新生命，可能是这意思
And since this is scofield's final step, a new life, could be something there.

246

引发突出部之役 那次反攻的代号？

We found his hard drive. It was full of information about Panama in particular.

278

Which he knows you have. Guy's got all kinds of hubris.

It's Panama's biggest exports.

290
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,907
别这样，老弟
Come on, man.

291
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,516
我们刚逃出来 你就一直在聊巴拿马和烂公车
You've been talking about Panama and bumpy bus rides ever since we broke out.

292
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,710
-现在真正搭上来了K -她应该和我们在一起
- And now we're actually doing it... - she should've been here with us.

293
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,020
要救她，以后时间多得是
We got all the time in the world for that.

294
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,524
-之后你和莎拉K -我们到了再说好吗？
- Someplace down the track, you and sara... - Can we just get there, please?

295
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,423
当然
Sure.

296
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,692
目前查不到斯科菲尔德母亲 和巴拿马的关联性
So far, no hits on any connection between scofield's mother and Panama.

297
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,964
不过有三十八位不同组合的 克莉丝汀娜玫瑰
But there are 38 listings of Christina Rose in various combinations...

298
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,074
姓、名、中间名顺序不同
...of first name, middle name and last name.

299
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,473
好，把名字和刺青上的 六一七交叉比对
All right, cross-reference the names with the number 617 from the tattoo.

300
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,637
也许不是日期 看是否是住址
Maybe it's not a date. See if it's an address.

301
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,748
-知道了 -有消息就通知大使馆
- Got it. - Lf anybody pops, call the embassy.

302
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,113
请他们派人逮捕这女人 并侦讯她
Have them send an officer to pick up the woman for questioning.

303
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,483
我们无权逮捕外国公民 如果没有K
I don't think we can just arrest a foreign citizen without...

304
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,650
爱国者法案，你祖母做手工 少绣一针我也可以逮捕她
Patriot Act. I could arrest your grandmother for missing a stitch in her macrame.

305
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,058
如果有人帮助斯科菲尔德 无论死活，我都要知道
If anybody's helping scofield, dead or alive, I wanna know who they are.

306
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,340
就是她？
That her?

307
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,998
对
Yeah.

308
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,180
你好，瓦士奎太太
Hola, Mrs. Vasquez.

309
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,287
你迟到了 比你说的日期晚太多了
You are late. It's much later than the date you said.

310
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,219
我们遇到了一点麻烦
Well, we ran into a little bit of trouble.

311
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,858
他是哪位？
Who is this?

312
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,761
我的合伙人
It's a business associate.

313

这里可以找到她
You will find her here.

315
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,940
我们在外头碰面
I'll meet you outside.

316
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,942
我有事忘了问
I forgot to ask something.

317
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,341
好
All right.

318
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,544
我可以借用电话吗？
Do you have a phone I could use?

319
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,290

我们甚至不知她是死是活
We don't even know if she's alive.

325
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,904
如果莎拉被逮捕 手机就在他们手上

你想被逮吗？
You wanna get caught?

327
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,760
-喂 -我讨厌三件事，亚历
- Yeah? - Three things I hate, Alex.

328
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:28,235
塞车、曲棍球 和不断打电话问你相同的问题
Traffic, hockey, and calling you with the same question over and over.

329
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,467
那就别再打来 但我想那对兄弟在巴拿马
Then don't call me anymore. But I believe the brothers are in Panama.

330
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,737
-是吗？ -正确地点在斯科菲尔德的刺青上
- Is that so? - The key to where is on scofield's tattoos.

331
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,212
虽然很高兴你把范围 缩小到一个国家
While I'm thrilled you've narrowed it down to a country...

332
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,248
这不是我打来的目的
...that's not why we're talking.

333
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,284
班哲明迈尔斯富兰克林还活着
Benjamin Miles Franklin is alive.

334
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,853

336

不可能 需要我的办公室同意才行

337
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,525
很高兴你掌控着大局
Good to know you're on top of things.

338
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,497
叫卫勒探员来找我
Find me Agent Wheeler.

339
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,874
你可以去见他了
He'll see you now.

340
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,821
请恕我直说，长官 难道不能在我的办公室谈吗？
Forgive me for asking, sir, but couldn't we be doing this in my office?

341
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,055
那样会舒适许多
It'd be much more comfortable.

342
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,298
我认为有必要开天窗说亮话
I felt we needed to speak freely.

343

接下来几小时内 这里是K
For the next several hours, this is what those...

344
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,299
情报单位所谓的盲点
...in the intelligence community refer to as a blind spot.

345
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,005
听说是受到太阳位置的影响
Something to do with the position of the sun, I'm told.

346
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,979
长距离录音设备会受到干扰
Disrupts long-distance recording devices.

347
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,220
长官，我再次致歉
If I may apologize again, sir...

348
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,323
总统事件的结局不尽理想
...for the unfortunate outcome with the president.

349
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,121
我知道她对我们很重要 我保证下一步K

350
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,889
不准你移动一步 直到你能K
You won't be moving anywhere until you can explain to me...

351
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,794
解释出了什么事为止
...how this happened.

352
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,532
这对兄弟
The brothers.

353
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,540
-他们让K -他们还活着？
- They're making it... - still alive?

354
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,842
是，显然他们已经逃离国内
Yes. It appears they were able to flee the country.

355
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,505
逃到哪里？
To where?

356
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,708
曼宏先生认为他们在巴拿马
Mr. Mahone seems to believe they're in Panama.

357
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:33,593
曼宏先生知道 他们在巴拿马的确切位置吗？
Does our Mr, Mahone know where exactly in Panama they are?

358
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,791
还不知道，怎么了？
Not yet. Why?

359
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,301
你对索拿了解多少，金先生？
How much do you know about sona, Mr. Kim?

360
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,235
只了解上级透露给我的资讯
Only what I've been given clearance on.

361
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:48,768
也许在这种情况下 我们需要改变策略
Perhaps what our situation requires is a change in strategy.

362
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,447
法院要多久才会批准逮捕令？
How long till the court approves the arrest warrant?

363
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,283
马上就来 只要等起诉书出炉
Any time now, Just waiting for the indictment to come down,

364
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,254
好，我有个问题
okay. Well, I've got a question for you.

365
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,951
他如果在怎么办？ 我不能一直躲着他
What if he's in there? I can't keep avoiding him.

366
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,495
他会看穿人心 这是他的工作
He reads people. That's what he does.

367
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,429
如果他发现我也牵扯在内 我就需要保护K
If he finds out I'm involved, I'm gonna need protection from...

368
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,764
卫勒，别紧张，深呼吸
Wheeler, relax. Take a breath.

369
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,601
曼宏只看得懂你写给他的资料 你可以装得很正常吗？
The only thing Mahone can read is what you write for him. Can you act normal?

370
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,003
只要这样就好
That's all you have to do,

371
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,303
现在别惊动他，让他跑了
We don't want him to get spooked and take off,

372
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,843
这件事马上就会结束
This is all gonna be over soon,

373
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,140
好吧，谢谢
All right. Thank you.

374
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,181
不，应该谢你才对
No. Thank you.

375
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,624
卫勒
Wheeler.

376
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,989
你上哪儿去了？
Where you been?

377
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,800
我必须这样做
I gotta do this.

378
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,010
你在干嘛，亚历？ 我身上没有窃听器
What are you doing, Alex? I'm not wearing a wire.

379
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,479
-告诉我怎么回事好吗？ -在古代的英国K
- You gonna tell me what's going on here? - In old England...

380
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,677
背叛是要被砍头的
...the punishment for a traitorous act was beheading.

381
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,887
砍头之后 他们会把断头拉起来
Following the execution, they would hold up the severed head by the hair.

382
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,289
不是让群众看人头 而是让人头看群众
Not for the crowd to see the head, but for the head to see the crowd...

383
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,125
因为断头之后 意识还会停留八秒
...because consciousness sticks around for another eight seconds.

384
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,200
这是给叛国贼 再一次机会K
Idea was that it would give the traitor one more chance to take...

385
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,133
你不会想这么做的 你想想K
You don't wanna do this, okay? Just take a moment...

386
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,399
如果你要在背后捅我！ 卫勒探员K
If you're gonna stab me in the back, Agent Wheeler...

387
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,406
就该学聪明把刀子藏好
...be smart enough to cover up the knife.

388
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,704
这礼拜你去找富兰克林三次
You go and visit Franklin three times this week.

389
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,847
每天和索伦斯讲两次电话？
Called sullins, what, twice a day?

390
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,074
和我合作 都没让你长进一点吗？
Didn't you learn anything working for me?

391
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,617
一定要不露痕迹，除非K
You gotta cover your tracks, unless you...

392
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,021
除非你想被逮到
Unless you wanna get caught.

393
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,597
你想让我知道是你干的
You wanted me to know it was you.

394
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,662
-你是杀人凶手，亚历 -是吗？
- You're a killer, Alex. - Is that so?

395
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,899
你家院子的土壤样本 和奥斯卡席尔斯的失踪有关
Soil samples from your yard in connection with the disappearance of oscar shales.

396
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,807
鉴识科准备要提报 你枪杀大卫阿普斯基的K
Forensics is prepared to submit a report detailing the irregularities...

397
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,210
所有不合理之处
...in the shooting of David "Tweener" Apolskis.

398
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,749
还有约翰亚布兹被枪杀时 你公然漠视程序K
There's your blatant disregard for protocol in the death of John Abruzzi...

399
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,218
还有一个逃犯说 我叫他自杀，我知道
And the escaped con who says that I told him to kill himself, I know.

400
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,292
你以为他的证词 可以让你飞上青天吗？
You think his testimony is gonna send you to the Promised Land?

401
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,355
你也可以把我除掉
You can erase me too.

402
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,524
但你无法抹灭
But it's not gonna erase the very real fact...

403
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,796
你将在监狱度过余生的事实
...that you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.

404
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,201
你知道吗？
You know...

405
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,477
你让我想起刚上任的自己
You remind me of myself when I was a young agent.

406
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,381
什么？
What?

407
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,584
我真希望这句话是种称赞
I wish I could take that as a compliment.

408
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,122
你做得非常好，卫勒
That's some real fine work, Wheeler.

409
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,985
表现得很好
Good job, though.

410
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:52,955
千万别让人威胁你 做出不该做的事
Don't you let anyone scare you into doing the wrong thing.

411
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:58,997
让我带你到案
Let me take you in.

412
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,304
你捅了什么漏子 我们都可以处理
Whatever mess you're in, we can clean it up.

413
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,101
只有一种处理方法 只有一种
There's only one way to clean this. One way.

414
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,447
你有访客
Hey, you got a visitor.

415
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,746
-是谁？ -我不知道
- Yeah, who? - I don't know.

416
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,479
我只接到命令来带你
I was just instructed to bring you.

417
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:22,422
在告诉我是谁之前 我哪儿都不去，懂吗？
Hey, look, I ain't going nowhere until you tell me who it is I'm meeting, all right?

418
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,859
你们住手，听我说
You guys, just stop it. Listen to me for a second.

419

你只要出去看看就好
That's all you gotta do, go out and check.

420

那家伙看起来很高大
Look, the guy's kind of tall, okay?

421
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,933
至少可以帮这个忙吧？

-什么K？ -爸爸

423
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,774
天啊

过来
Come here.

425
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,148
爸爸好爱你
Daddy loves you so much.

426
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,856
是真的吗？
So is it real?

427
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:06,329
他说你可以出狱 而且我们不用再逃亡了
He says you're gonna go free, that we don't have to run anymore.

428
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,632

你不用担心
Now, don't you worry about it.

430
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,402
只要知道你的男人 有两把刷子
You just know that your man handles things.

431
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,342
对吧？没错
Ain't that right? That's right.

432
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,946
好吧，我不相信，但很好
Okay. I don't believe it, but okay.

433
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,384
班哲明，我要跟你谈一下
Benjamin, if I could just have a quick word.

434
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,018
好K
Yeah. Hey...

435
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,596
你们到走廊那边等我，好吗？
Why don't you go down the hall for just a quick second, okay?

436
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,391

437
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,934
东西在这儿
Here it is.

438
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,971
新住址、新身份
New address, new identities.

439
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,838
检察官会和你保持联络 讨论你的证词
The prosecutor's gonna be in touch to go over your testimony.

440
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,674
你只要在他指定的 时间、地点出现
So you just make sure you show up where he says and when he says.

441
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,544
好K
Yeah, okay, okay.

442
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,947
我是自由之身吧？
But I'm a free man, right?

443
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,283
自由之身
Free man.

444
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,194
等等，曼宏怎么办？
Oh, wait a minute. What about Mahone, you know?

445
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,353
我不想余生 都得小心翼翼过活
I don't wanna be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.

446
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,864
曼宏的事由我担心 你只需担心别惹上麻烦
You let me worry about Mahone. You just worry about staying out of trouble.

447
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,901
绝对不会有问题的 相信我
Hey, you ain't gonna have a problem with that. Trust me.

448
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,005
别搞砸了
Don't screw it up.

449
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,727
还有多远？
How much further?

450
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,591
不远
Not far.

451
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,964
你该知道，莎拉是自愿的
You know, for what it's worth, no one forced sara to do what she did.

452
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,065
只要你觉得心安理得就好
Whatever gets you through the night.

453
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,832
这话什么意思？ 我又没有叫你利用她
What the hell does that mean? I didn't ask you to use her.

454
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,441
事情没那么单纯
It's not that simple.

455
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,477
-只要你觉得心安理得就好 -林克，知道什么让我很讶异吗？
- Whatever gets you through the night. - You know what amazes me, Linc?

456
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,642
你从不把事情放在心上 你从不在意
Nothing ever registers with you. Ever.

457
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,011
过了就算了，对吧？
It just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?

458
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:03,977
我们毁了莎拉的人生 你却仿佛不痛不痒
We ruin sara's life and it's like you don't even care.

459
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,124
-你这么认为？ -我们在这儿，莎拉在监牢里
- Is that what you think? - We're here, and sara's back in prison.

460
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,089
-这公平吗？ -当然不公平
- Does that seem fair? - None of it's fair.

461
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,093
-别一付失去女友的样子 -不然谁是重点？
- Don't make this about boy loses girl. - Who should it be about?

462
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,094
威莫兰？中间人？
Westmoreland? Tweener?

463
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,755
-罗杰？ -不要再说了
- L. J? - Let me stop you there.

464
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,165
记得我引发暴动时 被杀死的狱警名字吗？
Remember the name of the guard murdered because of the riot I started?

465
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,168
-闭嘴，迈克 -你记得他的名字吗？
- Shut up. - Do you even remember his name?

466
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,967
-闭嘴 -你应该记得哩诺卡吧？
- Shut up. - Bet you remember Veronica's, don't you?

467
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,702
-不准再提到她的名字！ -茶包呢？
- Mention her name again, I swear to God! - What about T-Bag?

468
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,470
他因为我们的关系 消遥法外！
He's out there now because of us.

469
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,170
都是因为你和我！
You and me.

470
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:39,081
他取走的每一条性命 都要算在我们头上
Every life he takes, that's blood on our hands.

471
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,952
都是为了什么？
And for what?

472
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,589
我并没有要你来救我
I didn't ask you to do what you did.

473
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,898
他们要杀你，林克
They were gonna kill you, Linc.

474
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,693
也许你该让他们得逞！
Well, maybe you should've let them.

475
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,363
收回这句话
Take that back.

476
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:23,164
虽然莎拉的遭遇我很内疚 但她有选择的余地
As bad as I feel about sara, she had a choice.

477
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,203
哩诺卡没有选择余地
Veronica didn't.

478
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,203
我听着她被杀，迈克
I listened to her die, Michael.

479
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,669
我听着她死去 我却无能为力
I listened to her die, and there was nothing I could do.

480
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,107
我救不了她
Nothing.

481
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,921
我们失去太多了
We've lost so much, man.

482
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,583
不能再失去彼此
We can't afford to lose each other.

483
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,661
不能再失去了
We just can't.

484
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,687
打算要出远门吗，亚历？
Going somewhere, Alex?

485
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,826
不知道，有吗？
I don't know. Am I?

486
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:27,023
别这样 你知道我不喜欢事必躬亲
Come on. You know I don't like to get my hands dirty.

487
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,971
当有充份原动力时 人能做出的行为真令人惊讶
It's surprising the things a man will do when properly motivated.

488
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,612
这句话是你告诉我的吧？
Wasn't it you who told me that?

489
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,310
我可以现在杀了你
You know, I would kill you right now...

490
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,917
只为得到一丝平静
...if I thought it would give me an ounce of peace.

491
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,915
什么事能给你平静？
And what would give you peace?

492
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:57,125
整个过程 我都设法保持冷静
I've been able to hold it together through all this...

493
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,658
因为原本还有出路可言
...because there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

494
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:06,498
有人生 在等我和我的家人
A life at the end of the tunnel for me, for my family.

495
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,263
现在呢？
And now what?

496
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,239
你有看到我儿子 我妻子的样子吗？
Do you see my son? Do you see my wife?

497
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,268
我得到什么？ 你给了我什么？
What have I got? What have you given me?

498
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,279
如果我告诉你K
What if I was to tell you...

499
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:24,311
有办法找回那条出路呢？
...that there was something that could turn that light back on?

500
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,717
你会怎么说？
What would you say?

501
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,950
我会说那是跟你拖我下水时 一样的烂话，你这浑蛋
I'd say that's the same offer you made when you dragged me into this.

502
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,757
瞧我得到什么 他们要把我公诸于世
And look where it's got me now. They're gonna drag me before the public.

503
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,058
他们要将我 像杀人犯一样起诉
They're gonna prosecute me like some kind of murderer.

504
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,796
他们手上的实证 是你无法湮灭的
There's evidence, really hard, tangible evidence that you can't take away.

505
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,899
你说的对
You're right.

506
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,074
但我可以帮你脱罪
But I can help you get away.

507
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,740
到了这节骨眼 你似乎别无选择
And at this point, I don't think you've got any other options.

508
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,421
西奥多“茶包”包威 在墨西哥被逮捕
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell was apprehended in Mexico.

509
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,181
我猜猜，你要我杀了他
Oh, let me guess, you want him dead.

510
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,757
不
Oh, no.

511
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,596
我们的策略有点改变
There's been a change in strategy.

512
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,061
我们要留他活口
We're gonna need him alive.

513
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,567
这是一个真正的终点，亚历
I'm talking about a very real finish line here, Alex.

514
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,205
你一路走来，很辛苦
You've come so far.

515
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,102
我还要再走多久？
How much further would I have to go?

516
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,301
算你走运
Well, you're lucky.

517
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,010
这次你只要去巴拿马
For this, you only have to go to Panama.

518
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,818
我正试图回想我们的人生 还有意义可言的时候
I'm trying to remember the last time our lives made any kind of sense.

00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,480
-这浑蛋怎么会来巴拿马？ -我们得去抓他
What is that son of a bitch doing in Panama?

575
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,983
-别管他了，我们不需要钱 -不是为了钱，林克
- We gotta go after him. - Just let it be.

576
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,978
- We don't need the money. - It's not about the money, Linc.

577
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:33,920
只要茶包p遥法外 我们之后做的善事都没意义
Whatever good we do from here on out doesn't matter as long as T-Bag's out there.

578
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,322
-迈克，都走到这K -我做错太多事，我只希望K
- Michael, we made it. All we... - Much has gone wrong. If we could just...

579
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,192
我只希望这么一次 能做对的事情
if we could just make this right.

580
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,228
巴拿马市只有一个小时路程 而且已经知道他的下落
Panama City is only an hour away. And now we know where he's staying.

581
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,130
通知警察
Call the police.

582
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,238
我选巴拿马是有原因的 这里没有引渡条款
There's a reason I chose Panama. There's no extradition laws.

583
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,930
警察不会管他的
They're not gonna touch him.

584
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,973
那你想怎么做？
So, what are you gonna do?

585
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,075
我再想办法
I'll figure something out.

586
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,579
再想办法？ 你连上厕所都要计划，少来了
Figure it out? You don't take a piss without a plan, man. Come on.

587
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,774
我做事从不考虑 瞧我有什么下场
Look, I never think, and look where it got me.

588
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,816
对，你落到巴拿马 一艘满是酒的船上
Yeah, in Panama with a boatload of booze.

589
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,114
是你帮我的 我只害自己被判死刑
You got me that. I got me a death sentence.

590
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:10,283
听着，我们先出海 仔细考虑
Look, let's just get out to sea, think things through.

591
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,986
等时机对了 我们再做这件好事
When the time's right, we make it right.

592
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,889
可以吗？
Okay?

593
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,873
（我加入，到了通知我 迈克留）

594
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,376
（我明天到，到时见 苏克留）

595
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,648

Home, sweet home.

600
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,670
酒拿来了 但莱姆汁好像坏掉了
I got the booze, but the limes are shot.

601
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,975
迈克？

602
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,479
