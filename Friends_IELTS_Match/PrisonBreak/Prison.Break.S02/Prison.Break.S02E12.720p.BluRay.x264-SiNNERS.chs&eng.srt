你这个偷窃的浑蛋

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,540
你最好跪下 祈祷我找不到你
You better get down on your knees and pray to God that I don't find you.

我们收到柏劳 和他弟弟会合地的线索

他称这个地方叫波修伊布斯

这是数字

输入卫星导航器，它就会带你到 新墨西哥沙漠的一处
Plug them into your GPs. It'll take you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,395
我们现在该怎么办？

你敢违抗我的话，就死定了

19
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,114
杀了她，保罗
Put her in the ground, Paul,

20
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,513
你现在要死了
You're going to die.

21
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,814
你只要告诉我 你父亲给了你什么就够了
And all you had to do was tell me what your father gave you.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,252
你去死吧
Go to hell.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,563
飞机会降落在七里的路标旁
The plane's gonna stop at the seven-mile marker...

24
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,826
日落的时候，在四号公路

-你怎么可能认识他，不可能的 -我认识他，我认识这个人

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,424
-迈克K -不要再靠近了
- Michael. - Maybe that's far enough.

32
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,435
-这与你无关 -到底怎么回事，爸？
- This doesn't concern you. - What the hell's going on, Dad?

33
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,168
妈去世后K

00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,786
他会处罚我
He punished me.

38
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,393
把我关起来
Locked me up.

39
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,727
一个人长时间被关在黑暗中
If you leave someone alone in the dark for that long,,,

40
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,036
眼睛就会开始适应
,,, their eyes start to adjust,

41
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,539
再小的东西 你都会开始看得清楚

因为只要它们存在 就可以帮助你

逃出去
Get out,

46

我已经用过各式各样的鱼饵
I've used just about every lure that you can use,

47

大部份的鱼饵 需要专业知识才能用

48
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,925
这个电动鱼饵就不同了

任何人钓鱼时都能使用
Everybody, I mean, everybody, can fish with it,

50
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,333
你可以钓到更大的鱼 钓到更多的鱼

00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,963
它甚至可用在大部份顶尖水中鱼饵 都没办法的多水草水域
It even works in weedy areas where most top water lures won't work,

It's one very cool bait,

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,815
我从未见过这么棒的鱼饵
I have never seen anything quite like this,

55
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,248
即使过去你曾在电视购物 买过让你失望的鱼饵
Even if you've bought lures off Tv in the past and been disappointed,,,

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,320
相信我，我能感同身受K

-抱歉，我以为你离开了 -没有，我还在
- oh, sorry, man. I thought you'd left. - Hey. No, still here. Here I am.

只是有一些房客抱怨
It's just that a couple guests are complaining...

59
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,562
你的电视太大声了

抱歉K我睡着了 一定是不小心按到遥控器

- I'll take care of it. Thanks. Sorry. Thanks. - That's great.

62

So could you do that for me now, please, so it's taken care of?

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,434

你的浴室传来怪声
In your bathroom. There's a noise coming from it.

你怎么能用自己的双手 对另一个人
How could you do that to another human being...

79
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,743
做出这么惨忍的事？
...with your own hands?

80
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,586
不要怕
It's okay.

81

我已经尽快找到你了 州政府一直让你转移

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,692
之后你又离开了
Then you went away again.

97
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,231
你以为让你受苦我不心痛吗？
You don't think it killed me to leave you like that?

98
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,891
丢下你我不难过吗？
To leave in the first place?

99
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,832
我从一开始就是大麻烦
Since the beginning, I was the problem.

00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,939
从一开始就是 你们过去受苦都是因为我

对，林克告诉过我“公司”的事

显然你是某种分析师 为了工作抛弃我们
You were some kind of analyst. That's the job you chose over your family.

103
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,180
我以为这么做才是对的 可以保护你们
I thought I was doing the right thing, protecting you.

104
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,976
谁会危害我们，爸？
From what, Dad? From who?

105
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,948
公司树敌无数 我原本受公司器重
The Company had enemies. I was important to The Company.

106
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,488
后来成为目标 透过你们就能轻松逮到我
I became a target. Easiest way to get to me would be to get to you.

107
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,286
当我发现公司的腐败，我马上离开
I left as soon as I realized how corrupt it was.

108
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,259
-他们收买政府K -你可以回到我们身边

110
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,863
迈克，我背叛公司 让我们都深陷更大的危机
Michael, turning on The Company put me and you at even greater risk.

111
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,668
我不得不远离你们
I had to stay away.

112
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,271
我们是你的儿子
We were your sons.

113

如果找到，林克就能重获自由
Linc will be set free if we find it.

120
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,567
你一定想不到 他认为东西在谁手上
You're not gonna believe who he thinks has it.

121
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,894

她伤得不轻
She'd be pretty banged up.

125
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,185
目前急诊室病患没有 符合这个特征的人
No one matching that description has been brought into the ER,

126
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,982
我是凯勒曼
Kellerman.

127
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,627
莎拉丹奎迪进展如何？
The report on sara Tancredi?

128
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,059
她死了，我正在处理尸体
She's dead. I'm dealing with the body right now.

129
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,531
-都结束了，你一定松了一口气 -对

132
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,537
在你弃尸前，我需要尸体照片
I need a photo of the body before disposal.

133
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,109
用你的手机照相寄给我K

比尔，现在不方便，好吗？
Bill, not a good time right now, all right?

135
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,150
保罗，放轻松
Paul, take a breath...

136
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,713
拍下照片
...then take the picture.

137
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,548
我等你
I'm waiting.

138
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,260
（北达科塔州，哈维）
"They traveled into a very dangerous place.

139
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,595
他们来到一个非常危险的地带

140
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,296
阿维德深知危险 但他依旧紧紧抓住龙的疆绳
Now, Arvid knew that, but he held tightly onto the dragon's leash anyway...

141
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,771
这只龙冲进黑暗的森林里
...as the creature ran into the ever-dark forest...

142
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,137
把这男孩拖在身后
...pulling the young boy behind him."

143
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,010
他为什么不放开疆绳？
Why didn't he just let go of the leash?

144
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,116
因为他喜欢这只龙
Well, because he loved the dragon.

145
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,948
当你爱某人的时候 你会不顾一切留住他们
And when you love someone, you'll do anything to hold onto them.

146
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,554
不顾一切保护他们，让他们快乐
Anything to keep them safe and happy.

147
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,586
所以我们才来露营？
Is that why we're camping?

148
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,095
对，这样我们就能在一起
Yep, so we can all be together.

149
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,792
我很快乐
I'm happy.

150
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,834
我也很快乐
You know, I'm happy too.

151
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,777
你拿去看吧
Here you go.

152
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,494
现在都没事了，对吧？
Well, it's all working out, huh?

153
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,264
不要这么说
Don't say that.

154
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,076
你知道吗？此时此刻K
You know, this moment, right here, right now...

155
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,313
一切都值得了
...it's all worth it.

156
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,847
我爱你
I love you.

157
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,652
我爱你
I love you.

158
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,727
（堪萨斯州，垂比云）

159
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,247
那是以前的照片
Oh, that's old.

160
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,587
-孩子已经长大了 -抱歉，我只是K
- The kids are bigger now. - Sorry, I was just...

161
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,158
你等了太久所以无聊的发慌了
oh, getting bored out of your wits because you've been waiting so long.

162
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,158
很抱歉让你久等
I'm really sorry about all this.

163
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,593
本地很少发生凶杀案
We don't get a whole bunch of homicides out here...

164
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,393
我们要温习一下怎么办案 请坐
...and we're trying to play catch-up. Please, have a seat.

165
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,530
你朋友的死我很遗憾
I'm real sorry about your friend.

166
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,806
现在的人真变态
It's a sick world out there.

167
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,035
你说得没错
Ain't that the truth.

168
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,876
-你们一起来堪萨斯州？ -没错
- So you guys out here in Kansas together? - Yeah, that's right.

169
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,544
来做什么？
Doing what?

170
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,746
来看看风景
Well, you know, just seeing the sights.

171
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,581
你从芝加哥到堪萨斯州 垂比云来看风景？
You left Chicago to see the sights in Tribune, Kansas?

172
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,814
据我所知，人民有行动自由
Last I checked, a man could go where he wanted.

173
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,755
-贝里克先生 -叫我布拉德
- Mr. Bellick. - Brad.

174
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,452
布拉德
Brad.

175
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,030
布拉德 我不在乎你来这里的目的
I don't really care what you were doing out here.

176
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,226
我们都是执法人员 见到变态就像闻到臭屁一样
We're both in law enforcement. We can each sniff out a perp like a hot fart.

177
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,000
抱歉我口出秽言
Pardon my French.

178
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,738
我们都知道你不是罪犯
And we both know you're not a criminal...

179
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,905
我不在乎你们俩是否 背着妻子偷腥，或是K
...so I don't care if you boys were out here whooping it without your wives...

180
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,410
你们俩有奸情
...or going Brokeback.

181
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,073
什么？
What?

182
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,480
才不是
Hell, no.

183
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,213
我是想说我不在乎你们的目的
My point is, I don't care what you were doing.

184
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,257
我只想知道你们去过哪里 可能碰过了谁
I just need to know where you were doing it and who you might've crossed paths with...

185
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,986
我才能找出 杀死葛瑞先生的凶手
...so I can find out who carved up Mr. Geary.

186
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:08,031
葛瑞和我得到线索 说福克斯河八人帮之一在此地
Geary and I got a lead that one of the Fox River Eight was in town.

187
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,897
哪一个？
Which one?

188
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,443
-西奥多包威 -那个对青少年做出
- Theodore Bagwell. - The man who did those horrible things...

189
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,477
-恐怖事情的人？ -就是他
...to those teenagers? - That's him.

190
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,049
我们打算抓他去领赏金 可是抓不到他
We're gonna bring him in for the reward money but we couldn't get a handle.

191
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,914
葛瑞和我觉得不可能 便分道扬镖，不过K
Geary and I split up, we figured we didn't have a shot, but...

192
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,078
-不过什么？ -在发生这种事后
- But what? - Well, after what happened...

193
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,158
我觉得葛瑞 也许真的遇到包威了
...I'm starting to think maybe Geary ran into old Bagwell after all.

194
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,028
在垂比云？
Right here in Tribune?

195
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,260
布拉德，你可以回答几个问题
Now, Brad, do you think you could answer some questions...

196
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,631
帮助我们找到 西奥多包威吗？
...that might help us, you know, track down Theodore Bagwell?

197
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,294
我会很感激
I'd be indebted.

198
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,873
我会尽全力帮忙抓到那个浑蛋
I'll do whatever I can to help nail that son of a bitch.

199
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,908
你认为录音在莎拉手上？
You think sara has this tape?

200
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,443
政府是这么想
The government does.

201
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,881
我昨天才碰过她 就算在她手上
I just saw her yesterday. If she does have anything...

202
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,313
她自己也不知道
...she doesn't know.

203
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,786
-她现在人在哪？ -我不知道
- Well, where is she now? - I don't know.

204
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,621
你有办法和她连络吗？
Any way you can get in touch with her?

205
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,989
-我们有买手机，我可以打电话给她 -拜托K老哥
- We bought cell phones. I could call her. - Please, please, please, bro.

206
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,756
到巴拿马后再打给她，拜托
Call her from Panama, please.

207
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,196
剩下不到两小时 我一定要搭上飞机
We got less than two hours. I gotta make the flight.

208
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,236
怎么了？
What?

209
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,636
快跑！
Run. Run!

210
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,155
-你说的车子在哪里？ -在山丘后面
- Where's this car you keep talking about? - It's over the ridge.

211
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,313
把枪给我，你们上车去
Give me that. You guys head for the car.

212
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,988
快点
Go!

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,181
爸，上车

快来，爸！
Come on, Dad!

218
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,432
我们成功了！太好了
We made it! Son of a bitch, we made it!

219
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,767
林克
Linc.

220
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,721
苏克，送我们去医院
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

221
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,331
-这地方怎么可能有K？ -快送我们去医院，拜托
- Out here? Where the hell am I gonna find...? - Just get us to a hospital, please!

222
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,966
别担心，你不会有事的
Don't worry, you're gonna make it.

223
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,193
这是胆汁，子弹射穿我的身体
It's bile. He got me clean through.

224
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,465
你不会有事的，撑着点
You're gonna be okay. Just hold on.

225
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,075
你们两个，听我说
Listen to me, both of you.

226
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,142
对不起
Sorry.

227
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,612
我但愿我从未离开你们
I wish I'd never left.

228
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,876
不要说话，继续呼吸
Don't talk. Just breathe, okay?

229
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,293
好，你想吃花生酱香蕉三明治吗？
Okay. So do you want a P.B. & B?

230
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,456
不想，我的肚子痛
Not really. My tummy hurts.

231
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,363
她的背包在哪里？
Where's her knapsack?

232
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,495
什么？

233
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,174
-她的背包，里面有她的药 -我不知道，我抓住她就跑了
- Her knapsack. Her medicine's in it. - I don't know. I just grabbed her and ran.

234
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,176
她需要吃药 两天没吃药会发作
She needs that medicine. She can't go two days without it.

235
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,881
我知道，我是她父亲，好吗？
Okay, I know. I'm her father, all right?

236
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,381
在哪里？
Where is it?

237
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,213
宝贝，冷静点 你要找什么？
Baby, baby. Look, look, calm down. What are you looking for?

238
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,117
告诉我你要什么 我就去买，好吗？
Just tell me what it is and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

239
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,985
她的处方
Her prescription.

240
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,191
这是备用处方，我留着以防万一
It's a backup. I keep an extra, in case.

241
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,627
好K
Okay, okay.

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,964
我只要去找家药房
So all I need to do is find a pharmacy.

243
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,809
不要担心
Don't worry.

244
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,002
看来我们要去兜风了，宝贝
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride, sweet pea.

245
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,513
如果抓到包威 他手上可能还有葛瑞的东西
If we nail Bagwell, he might still have some of Geary's things on him...

246
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,243
像是背包 里面有他的私人物品
...like his backpack, which has his personal stuff in it.

247
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,853
我想他妻子会想收到那些东西
I know his wife would love to have it.

248
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,011
如果抓到包威
If we find Bagwell...

249
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,885
-你可以亲自交给她 -谢谢
...give it to her personally. - Thanks.

250
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,186
你协助办案 这是我起码能做的
It's the least I can do considering how you're helping me out.

251
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,297
不过有些警员有点担心K
Although some of the guys on the force are concerned about...

252
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,026
-他们担心什么？ -没什么
- What are they concerned about? - Oh, nothing.

253
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,900
这样吧 不如告诉我你的所知吧
You know what? Why don't you tell me what you know?

254
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,835
我们找到包威 把葛瑞的物品交给他的家人
We'll track down Bagwell, get Geary's effects to his family.

255
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,909
我会让所有人知道 你是最大功臣
I'll make sure everybody involved knows your help was invaluable.

256
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,013
我会建议让你得到 就算不是所有，也是大部份的赏金
I'll even recommend that you get most of, if not all of that reward money.

257
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,778
那些警员到底 对什么事不放心？
Well, what is it exactly that the guys on the force were concerned about?

258
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,355
有些人认为 你对你的头伤有所隐瞒
Some of them thought you weren't being totally upfront about your injury.

259
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,892
老实说，你没看到打中你额头的人
I mean, to be fair, it does seem a little off that you didn't see the guy...

260
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:00,429
这件事的确有点奇怪
...who hit you smack-dab on the forehead.

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,731
被你猜中了
You got me.

262
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,305
葛瑞和我对于 抓包威的方式有点歧见
Geary and me had a little dust-up over how to go about finding Bagwell.

263
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,775
我们发生肢体冲突，他打我
It got physical and he hit me.

264
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,781
我们常像兄弟一样打架 我不想害他被警察抓
The two of us, we fought like brothers. I didn't wanna rat him out to the cops.

265
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,288
争执后我们就分开
After the fight, we split up.

266
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,456
然后K
And then...

267
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,721
你也知道他最后怎么了
Well, you know what happened to him.

268
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,025
我真希望我们没有打架
I just wish to hell we'd never fought, you know.

269
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,929
也许他现在就不会K
Maybe then, he'd still be...

270
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,771
布拉德，不要责怪自己
Brad, you can't blame yourself.

271
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:48,078
我们何不把精力专注在 找出杀死你朋友的凶手？
Why don't we refocus our energy on finding the man who killed your friend?

272
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,677
罗伊也会这么希望
That's what Roy would've wanted.

273
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,153
（欢迎莅临哈维）

274
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,358
（药局）

275
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,165
快点，宝贝
Where you at, baby?

276
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,099
保险卡？
Insurance card?

277
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,438
我没有保险
No, I don't have insurance.

278
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,547
你不用保险 要买醋酸地塞米松片？
You're paying for dexamethasone without insurance?

279
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,843
你有健保之类的吗？
You got Medicaid, Medicare or something?

280
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,278
没有，我付现金
Nope. I'll just pay cash.

281
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,785
要125元
It's 125.

282
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,795
（逃犯与家人依然在逃）

283
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,293
不好意思K
Excuse me.

284
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,104
小姐？
Excuse me?

285
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,173
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

286
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,355
抱歉，我没有小额的钞票
I'm sorry I don't have anything smaller.

287
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,490
我得去后面换零钱
I have to go to the back to get change for a hundred.

288
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,321
我马上回来
So I'll be right back.

289
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,143
-那里有医院 -我看到了
- Right there, hospital! - I see it, I see it.

290
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,210
-送我们过去 -不，你们会被抓
- Just get us there. - No, you'll be caught.

291
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,347
那就被抓吧
Then we'll be caught.

292
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,606
我不会让你死的
I'm not gonna let you die.

293
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,847
听我说
Then listen to me.

294
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,920
找到莎拉丹奎迪
You find sara Tancredi.

295
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,483
她可以解决一切
She can end this.

296
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,054
现在就靠你们了
It's up to you now.

297
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,666
我要通报，注意一台深蓝色轿车 车牌AE9268
Yeah, I want an alarm out on a dark blue sedan, license AE 9268.

298
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,244
位置在拉斯克鲁塞斯 东南方40里处
Forty miles southeast of Las Cruces.

299
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,043
立刻去办
Do it now.

300
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,310
真是的
Oh, come on.

301
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,516
干嘛？
What?

302
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,557
什么医院？
What hospital?

303
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,936
他严重枪伤被送来 医生通知我们
Came in with a bad GsW. Docs called us in.

304
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,162
他在里面
He's in here.

305
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,863
我们查过他的名字
We ran his name.

306
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,874
他因为走私毒品 被联邦调查局双重通缉
Came back with two federal drug-smuggling warrants out on him.

307
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,412
听说你想找我谈
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

308
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,851
我有调查局想要的资讯
I got some information the feds want.

309
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,146
是关于迈克斯科菲尔德的
About Michael scofield.

310
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,120
我知道他搭飞机的地点
Like where he's catching a ride.

311
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,261
在哪里？
And where would that be?

312
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,266
不只是地点，还有时间
It's not just the where, but the when.

313
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,367
时间马上就快到了
That when is coming up soon.

314
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,000
可是我要先谈好交换条件
But I wanna cut a deal first.

315
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,215
让我俩谈谈好吗？
Give us a minute?

316
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,454
你有话要说吗？
Anything you wanna say?

317
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,226
一天
One day.

318
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,560
我们只相处了一天
That's all we had.

319
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:59,429
以前，在最苦的时候
Back then, when things were at their worst...

320
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,765
我曾以为 我再也不会见到天日
...there were days I thought I'd never see the sun again.

321
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,864
但他救了我一命
But he saved my life.

322
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,205
我只希望当初他让我们 成为他生活中的一份子
Just wish he could've let us be a part of his.

323
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,546
对啊
Yeah.

324
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,293
我会告诉他
I'll tell him.

325
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,660
条件如下
Here's the deal.

326
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,397
所有罪名撤销 政府会付医药费
All charges dropped, government picks up medical costs...

327
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,200
直到你的状况可以出境为止
...until you're fit to be deported.

328
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,902
你的资讯要正确 条件才会生效
All contingent upon your information being accurate.

329
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,708
斯科菲尔德在哪里？
Where's scofield?

330
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,979
驱逐出境不行，我要公民权
No deportation. I want citizenship.

331
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,345
公民权？
Citizenship?

332
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:01,390
算是给我的奖励，我要白纸黑字
A little incentive, and I want it in writing.

333
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,755
我厌倦玩游戏了
Oh, I'm so tired of playing games.

334
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,227
那就开始打文件吧
Well, start typing.

335
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,466
关闭体外心律调节器
No external pacemaker.

336
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,604
这个精采，关闭止痛药点滴
Hey, this is a good one. No morphine drip.

337
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,303
-你在做什么？ -调查局，出去K
- What are you doing? - FBI. Out, out, out.

338
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,907
-你到底想做什么？ -给我一点奖励
- What the hell are you doing? - Giving you a little incentive.

339
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,879
快打开，你这个K
Come on. Come on, you son of a...

340
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,947
什么都没找到？
And they found nothing?

341
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,625
好，谢谢
Okay, thanks.

342
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,687
布拉德，你的直觉很准确
Well, your instincts are great, Brad.

343
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,126
辖区今天的确有派人 到贺兰德家一趟
But the precinct actually sent a unit over to Hollander's house today.

344
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,290
有匿名通报说有人闯入 可是里面没有人
An anonymous caller said they saw an intruder but no one was there.

345
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,026
可恶
Damn it.

346
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,034
如果你知道 包威和贺兰德的事
If you knew about Bagwell and Hollander...

347
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,332
你为何没有自己去瞧瞧？
...why didn't you just head over there yourself?

348
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,107
我们找不到房子
Oh, we couldn't find the house.

349
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,506
真的？她的住址有登记
Really? It's listed.

350
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,376
失陪
Excuse me.

351
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,726
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,698
一切都还好吧？
Everything okay?

353
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,128
很好，没事
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

354
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,002
布拉德，你去过芳勒瑞旅馆吗？ 离这里大约15分钟车程
You ever been to the Fauntleroy Hotel? It's about 15 minutes from here.

355
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,338
-我没听过这地方 -那就奇怪了
- Never heard of it. - Well, that's strange.

356
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,106
因为警方在葛瑞的旅馆房间里 找到这张收据
Because they found this receipt in Geary's hotel room.

357
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,748
是你的信用卡
It's from your credit card.

358
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,783
（铭谢惠顾）

359
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,915
我不知道怎么会这样
I don't know how that got there.

360
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,926
我认为你知情不报
I think you're being evasive.

361
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:49,331
-请你告诉我真相，贝里克先生 -怎么不叫我布拉德了？
- You should tell me the truth, Mr. Bellick. - What happened to "Brad"?

362
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,900
七年前，我第一次承办凶杀案
About seven years ago, I got my first homicide case.

363
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,096
一名美丽的女子 她被打得很惨
A woman. Pretty. She was brutally attacked.

364
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,605
被她狠心的男友丢下等死
Animal boyfriend left her for dead.

365
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,609
但当时她尚有一口气在
But she was still breathing, barely.

366
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,247
但她把凶手的电话
But she punched into her cell phone...

367
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,782
输入自己的手机 她替我们破了案
...the killer's number, so she solved the crime for us.

368
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
布拉德，我们找到收据时 葛瑞手握着它
When we found the receipt, Brad, it was in Geary's hand...

369
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,451
手指着你的名字 他用最后一口气
...his finger pointing to your name. With his last ounce of strength...

370
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,616
-告诉我们凶手是你 -好吧，听着
...he told us you killed him. - Okay, listen.

371
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,524
葛瑞和我 在贺兰德家找到包威
Geary and I found Bagwell in Hollander's house.

372
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,360
我们折磨他，逼他说出 他在犹他州挖出的五百万元
We roughed him up until he told us where he'd hid the 5 million bucks...

373
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,058
藏匿的地点
...we knew he'd dug up in Utah.

374
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,533
找到钱之后，葛瑞背叛我
When we found the money, Geary double-crossed me...

375
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,764
他揍我的头，把钱独吞
...he hit me in the head and took the cash.

376
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,239
葛瑞的死和我无关 你有听到吗？
I had nothing to do with Geary's death. You hear what I'm saying?

377
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,970
我才是受害者，不是那个浑蛋
I'm the victim here, not that son of a bitch.

378
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,355
快点K
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

379
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,891
你在做什么，宝贝？
Where you at, baby?

380
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,831
可以快一点吗？
Hey, could you hurry it up?

381
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,903
时间不早了，我得回家
It's just it's getting really late and I gotta get home.

382
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:13,616
这里有20、40、50 加20，共70元
And that's 20, 40, 50 and 20 is 70.

383
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:19,087
加上1、2、3、4、5 共75元
One, two, three, four, five is 75.

384
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,923
借过
Excuse me.

385
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,288
（营业中）

386
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,371
不要开玩笑了
You gotta be kidding me.

387
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,244
女士
Ma'am.

388
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,280
午安，警官
Afternoon, officer.

389
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,313
你有带证件吗？
Do you have any ID with you?

390
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,288
没有，我走路来这里 所以身上没有证件
No, I walked over here, so I didn't carry anything with me.

391
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,953
真的？你从哪里走来？
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

392
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,695
有问题吗，警官？
Is there a problem, officer?

393
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,200
问题是自找的，富兰克林太太
There's only a problem if you make one, Miss Franklin.

394
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,236
告诉我们你丈夫在哪好吗？
You want to tell us where your husband is?

395
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,705
我不知道
I don't know.

396
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,937
请把手放到背后，女士
Place your hands behind your back, please, ma'am.

397
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,954
宝贝，我对不起你
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

398
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,140
天啊
Oh, my God.

399
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,612
妈妈在哪里？
Where is Mommy?

400
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,021
妈妈晚点会来找我们，好吗？
Mommy is gonna meet us later, okay?

401
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,525
-什么事？ -照片在哪？
- Yes? - Where's the photo?

402
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,230
比尔，发生技术性失误
Bill, there was a tactical error.

403
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,998
我不想听什么 推卸责任的术语，保罗
I don't want terminology from the Cover Your Ass Handbook, Paul.

404
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,536
-怎么回事？ -发生无法预料的状况
- What happened? - There were unforeseen circumstances.

405
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,766
-我没料到会发生这种事 -莎拉在哪里？
- Things that could not be predicted. - Where's sara?

406
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,068
她跑掉了，对吧？
She's gone, isn't she?

407
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,651
对，她逃走了
Yes. She got away.

408
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,787
不过她不可能K
But there is no way that she...

409
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,684
比尔？
Bill?

410
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,756
我不会让你死的
I'm not gonna let you die.

411
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,563
我爱你
I love you.

412
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,697
你应该知道吧？
You know that, don't you?

413
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,390
太多人了
Too many.

414
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,393
太多人因为 我要你重获自由而死了
Too many people died because I wanted you to be free.

415
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,787
迈克，你当初料想不到
You couldn't have known, Michael.

416
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,395
你事先不可能 知道会有这种下场
You couldn't have known it would've ended up like this.

417
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,866
可是还是发生了
But it did.

418
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,363
他们要他的命
They wanted him.

419
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,844
要他没命
They wanted him in the ground...

420
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,577
现在他们达成目标了
...and they got their wish.

421
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,013
他们会继续追杀我们，迈克
This thing's not gonna end here, Michael.

422
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,911
-我知道 -事态会不断扩大
- I know. - It's gonna keep spreading.

423
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,287
他们的手会沾满更多鲜血
Their hands are gonna get more and more bloody.

424
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,554
重点是鲜血
The question is...

425
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:55,688
在他们手上 还是我们手上？
...is the blood on their hands or ours?

426
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,601
抱歉，两位
I'm sorry, guys.

427
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,805

432
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,265
通知墨西哥 取得国际追捕权

00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,537
告诉他们如果得打下飞机 就动手吧
Tell them if they've gotta take the plane down, just do it.

434
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,290

迈克，这是我们梦寐以求的时刻
Michael, this is what we've been waiting for.

440

452
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,022
开车到边境小镇 找有手机讯号的地方
...drive to a border town, find a cell phone signal...

453
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,291
打电话给莎拉
...and call sara.

454
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,003
战斗机怎么还没来？
Where the hell are those jets?

455
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,457

-我要离开这里 -这由不得你
- I'm out of here. - Not really an option for you.

464

就凭一张收据？是他放在口袋的 打架？有什么大不了的
What've you got? A receipt? He left it in his pocket. A fight? Big deal.

I got 10 pals in Chicago who'll tell you Geary and I threw down once a month.

不过如果加上这证据
But when you add this.

468
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,204

00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,814
你最好跪下 向天祈祷让我找不到你
You better get down on your knees and pray to God that I don't find you,

472

因为如果被我找到，听好了 我会让你死得很难看
