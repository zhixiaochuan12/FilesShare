00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,408
我们很久没有坐下聊聊了，对吧？
It's been a while since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?

147
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,739
-自从席尔斯越狱后，对吧？ -有问题吗，理查？
- Not since shales escape, right? - Yeah. What's going on, Richard?

148
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,542
这就是我来调查的原因
Well, that's precisely what I'm here to find out.

149
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,554
我查清楚前，你哪里都不能去
You're not getting out of here until I do.

150
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,191
（怀俄明州，来曼）

151
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,490
你瞧瞧，有人烟
Oh, my God, civilization.

152
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,006
珍妮，再来一杯吧
Jenny, how about another round over here?

153
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,512
你们要喝点什么？
What can I get for you, boys?

154
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,515
你说呢？
You tell me.

155
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,979
就两杯水吧
Two waters, then.

156
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,313
还有帮帮忙，借电话给我们
And the use of your phone, if you'd be so kind.

157
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,685
别担心，是市内电话
Don't worry, it's a local call.

158
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,784
我回家第一件事要做什么？
First thing I do we get home?

159
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,363
-换干净内裤 -然后呢？
- Clean underwear. - Then what?

160
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:50,229
回去那家酒品店 求老板让我回去工作
Guess I'll go back to that liquor store and beg for my job back.

161
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,438
我们差一点就到手了
We had it. We were so close.

162
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,579
我还可以闻到大笔钞票的香味
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.

163
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:05,308
只要喝几罐啤酒 再吃冷冻牛排大餐
Well, nothing that a couple of Keystones, a Hungry-Man salisbury steak dinner...

164
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,647
晚上看看电视 就会忘记这件事了
...and a night in front of the TV won't take care of.

165
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,121
妈，是我布拉德
Hey, Ma. It's Brad.

166
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,160
是这样的，罗伊和我的车抛锚了
Hey, listen, me and Roy, we ran into some car trouble...

167
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,696
你是不是可以来载我们？
...and we're wondering if you can pick us up.

168
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,825
我不知道
Well, I don't know.

169
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,560
这里是什么地方？
What the hell town is this?

170
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:28,400
-你不是说是市内电话吗？ -布拉德，你看
- Thought you said this was a local call. - Hey, Bradley, check this out.

171
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,802
稍等一下，妈
Just a minute, Ma.

172
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,842
这些人据说是几天前
These individuals were reportedly the prisoners who escaped,,,

173
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,005
从伊利诺州福克斯河州立监狱中 越狱的逃犯
,,, from the Fox River Penitentiary in Illinois just a couple of days ago,

174
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,050
他们怎么会跑到 犹他州的图尔？
What were they doing all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?

175
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,315
珍娜欧文斯的车库被他们挖开 而她自有一套想法
Well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage they dug up, has her own theory,

176
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,426
他们假扮成电力公司的工人
They pretended that they were some kind of workers,,,

177
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,587
说他们施工出了错
,,, from the power company and that they had made a mistake,,,

178
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,756
所以要开挖一下
,,, that they would have to do some digging,

179
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,401
警方正开始K
Investigators just,,,,

180
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,505
妈，这样好了 你可以汇钱给我们吗？
Hey, Ma, on second thought, can you wire us some extra scratch?

181
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,436
我们还有事没办完
Turns out we're not done yet.

182
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,919
哈
Hello.

183
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,219
-布鲁斯，我需要你帮忙 -莎拉？
- Bruce, I need your help, - sara?

184
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,453
布鲁斯，我父亲没有自杀 好吗？
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide, okay?

185
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,422
-你先冷静，你在哪里？ -他去调查柏劳案
- Okay, just calm down. Where are you? - He was looking into the Burrows case,

186
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,035
我认为他发现了不可告人的秘密
He found something that they didn't want him to know.

187
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,262
现在他们以为我也知道秘密
Now I think that they think that I know it too.

188
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,374
好，听我说 我会派人去接你
I want you to listen to me. I'm gonna send someone to pick you up.

189
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,409
我把你接回来这里 把事情解决，我保证
I'll bring you back here, we'll sort all of this out, I promise.

190
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,842
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are,

191
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,879
我不知道，我在打公共电话
I don't know. I'm at a payphone.

192
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,985
-第三街和哈坡路口 -你的手机有带在身上吗？
- Third and Harper. - You have your cell if I need to reach you?

193
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,417
有，但是可能会被监听
I do, but I thought it would be tapped.

194
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,687
-我不清楚 -我马上派人去
- I don't know. - Someone's on their way.

195
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,257
不要离开
Just stay right where you are.

196
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,958
谢谢
Thank you.

197
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,806
-这些值80美金 -拜托，它们K
- I'll give you 80 bucks for them. - Come on, man, they're worth...

198
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,467
它们对物主而言比较值钱
Worth a lot more to the person they actually belong to.

199
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,113
这是女用球杆，老兄
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

200
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,049
它们大概比猴子的护档热门
I'm guessing they're hotter than a monkey's jockstrap.

201
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,446
80美金
Eighty bucks.

202
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,084
加上冷藏箱我就愿意成交
Throw in the cooler and you got a deal.

203
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,965
-我们得把机车丢掉 -办不到
- We gotta lose the bike. - No way.

204
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,534
道路封锁了，这是唯一的出路
Roads are sealed. It's the only way we'll make it out.

205
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,965
不行，我答应彼提K
I can't. I promised Petey...

206
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,470
我们没办法带机车过河
We're not getting that thing across the river...

207
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,768
而我们现在 一丝时间都不能浪费，好吗？
...and every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have, okay?

208
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,970
抱歉，我们得出发了
I'm sorry, but we gotta move.

209
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,956
我听说这种河流 里面有水蛭，你知道吗？
I heard about these kind of places. They got leeches, you know?

210
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,858
我宁愿遇到水蛭 也不愿被铐上手铐
I'll take the leeches in here over the handcuffs back there.

211
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,498
我可不确定，老哥
I don't know, papi.

212
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,896
重点是水蛭吸的部位，你懂吗？
It depends where the leech leeches, you know...?

213
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,468
别闹了
Stop kidding around.

214
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,085
-你没事吧？ -我K身体不能动
- You all right, buddy? - I can't... I can't move.

215
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,083
你觉得有摔断什么吗？
You feel like you broke anything?

216
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,484
不，应该没有
No, I don't think so.

217
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,523
你能把树干移开吗？
Can you get it...? Can you get it off of me?

218
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,024
我试试看
I'll try.

219
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,559
我推不动树干
This thing's not going anywhere.

220
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,762
我去检查你的脚
I'm gonna check your foot.

221
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,919
抱歉，你被卡住了
I'm sorry, buddy. It's stuck.

222
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,627
-请叫救护车 -好
- I need you to call 911. - Okay.

223
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,496
深呼吸
Take a deep breath for me.

224
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,606
凯莉，我是莎拉 我是个医生，你不会有事的
Okay, Kelli, my name is sara. I'm a doctor. You're gonna be okay.

225
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,742
听得到吗？你不会有事的
Can you hear me? You're gonna be all right.

226
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,676
深呼吸，为我撑下去好吗？
I just need you to take some deep breaths and I need you to hang in there for me.

227
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,441
好K凯莉？
Okay... Kelli?

228
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,741
凯莉？
Kelli?

229
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,995
我不会有事，对吧？
It's gonna be okay, right?

230
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,757
你要是可以让八个人越狱
I mean, if you can get eight people out of prison...

231
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,697
救一个波多黎哥佬 应该不成问题吧？
...you can get my Puerto Rican ass out of this, right?

232
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,802
对吧？
Can't you?

233
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,118
该死
Damn it!

234
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,266
你有听到吗？
Did you hear that?

235
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,529
我听过这声音
I know that sound.

236
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,035
上游有个水库
There's a dam upriver.

237
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,507
那是个讯号
It's a signal.

238
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,476
代表闸门即将打开
It means they're opening the locks.

239
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,476
所以水位即将上升
That means the water level's gonna rise.

240
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,877
到时树干就会漂起来
When it does, the log will just float right off.

241
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,544
是吗？
Yeah?

242
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:15,846
K23，警犬发现多人气味
K-23, canine units at the scene have multiple scents,,,

243
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,818
气味扩散到各处
...and are spreading out into the field.

244
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,083
逃犯应该就在附近
These guys can't have gotten far.

245
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,888
房子里有六名逃犯
There were six cons back at that house.

246
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,053
他们会从各处追踪我们
They'll be tracking us in every direction.

247
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,459
得花上几小时才会赶到这里 到时水位已经上升
It'll take them hours to make it over this far and by that time, the water level will rise.

248
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,900
-我们早就逃之夭夭了 -你确定？
- And we'll be long gone. - Are you sure?

249
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,969
对，我确定
Yeah, I'm sure.

250
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,506
我确定
I'm sure.

251
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,980
现场20名警察都知道
Ask any of the 20 cops there.

252
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,673
约翰亚布兹有武器，他打算开枪
John Abruzzi was armed. John Abruzzi drew his weapon.

253
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,046
他不应该有机会 打算开枪的
He never should have been allowed to get that far.

254
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,883
我把话讲清楚 如果你懂得如何办逮捕行动
Let's be clear. If you knew how things needed to be handled on a manhunt...

255
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:56,585
你现在应该已在办案 而不是只能阻扰办正事的人
...you'd be out there running one instead of hamstringing the men that are.

256
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,788
调查局侦办逃犯的主要目标
The FBI's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters...

257
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,401
在于快速找到并逮捕逃犯
...is to effect the swift location and capture of the fugitives.

258
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,332
你只有两具尸体，亚历
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

259
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,301
这两人是重刑犯，理查
I've got two dead felons, Richard.

260
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,407
也许会让公关方面很难堪
Maybe that doesn't play well from a public-relations standpoint...

261
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,603
但从公共安全来说，对亚布兹 和阿普斯基的措施完全合法
...but from a public-safety standpoint, Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.

262
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,739
近距离射杀 手无寸铁的小孩算合法？
The shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range is by the book?

263
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,475
少来了
Come on.

264
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,284
根据报告 大卫阿普斯基，绰号中间人
Incident report, David "Tweener" Apolskis.

265
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,447
我很好奇
You know, I'm curious.

266
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,752
-护送时他有铐上手铐吗？ -有
- Was he cuffed during transport? - Yeah.

267
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,090
报告指出他不知如何 抢走了你主要的枪
It says in here he somehow managed to grab your primary weapon.

268
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,789
-你用肩上的枪套吗？ -臀部的
- You carry that in a shoulder holster? - Hip.

269
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,492
-左边或右边？ -左边
- Left, right? Right, left? - Left.

270
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,261
左边
Left.

271
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,005
抱歉，有时我脑袋不清楚
I'm sorry. I get confused sometimes.

272
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,267
让我确认一下来龙去脉
So just so I've got this right...

273
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,006
你独自开车 载着上手铐的犯人
...you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner...

274
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,844
不知如何 他把手伸到你胸前
...and somehow he reaches forward across your chest...

275
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,315
抢走你的枪
...grabs your weapon.

276
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,352
阿普斯基夺枪时 你反应没这么快，真可惜
It's too bad you didn't react that quickly with Apolskis.

277
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,790
说不定他就不会死了
Maybe he'd still be alive.

278
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,629
（有个计划可导正一切）

279
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,195
一只纸鹤和这件事有何关联？
What does origami have to do with any of this?

280
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,840
麦可史柯菲寄给她的
Michael scofield sent it to her.

281
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,101
既然你铲除莎拉丹奎迪的
And since your brilliant plan to eliminate...

282
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,677
妙计完全失败了K
...sara Tancredi from the equation failed completely...

283
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,839
-我不认为彻底失败 -电话亭旁死了一个女人
- I wouldn't say it failed completely. - There's a dead woman in a phone booth.

284
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,847
一个老百姓
A civilian.

285
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,581
一定数量的尸体 可以藏到地毯下
A certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.

286
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:08,851
总统地毯下的尸体 多到让人站不稳
The president's rug is getting so full you can barely stand on it.

287
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,658
那么你有何建议？
So, what do you suggest we should do?

288
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,929
-你去钓过鱼吗？ -说重点
- Ever go fishing, Bill? - Just make your point.

289
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,568
钓鱼有两种方式
There's two ways to catch a fish.

290
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,172
洒下大网，希望抓到想要的鱼
You cast out a big net and hope you get what you're looking for.

291
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,333
或是选对鱼饵，保证钓到想要的鱼
Or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.

292
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,705
这个策略简单，到处都适用
It's a simple strategy, it plays across the board.

293
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,042
利用罗杰找到柏劳 用莎拉找到史柯菲
L.J. Will lead us to Burrows. Sara will lead us to scofield.

294
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,047
你要如何跟踪莎拉？ 你现在手头上只有一只纸鹤
How do you intend to follow sara when the only lead you've got is an origami bird...

295
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,654
还有停用的电话号码
...with an out-of-service phone number?

296
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,787
也许它不是电话号码
Maybe it's not a phone number.

297
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,040
-有何消息？ -儿子已经出狱
- What do you have? - Junior's on the move...

298
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,644
还是没有柏劳的踪影
...and still no sign of Burrows.

299
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,872
长官，那家伙躲起来了 也许根本不知道儿子出狱了
Sir, the guy's in hiding. Maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.

300
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,018
犹他州被挟持的警察说 柏劳丢下其他人离开时
The cop that was held hostage in Utah has Burrows splitting off...

301
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:11,053
时间刚好是在罗杰柏劳 被释放的消息曝光后
...from the rest of the group just after word of L.J.'s release hit the wires.

302
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,656
他绝对知道
He knows,

303
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,292
如果想确定他是否在场
Now, if we wanna know for sure if he's there...

304
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,088
就要想办法引他出来
...we need to do something to draw him out.

305
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,347
老兄，赏点零钱好吗？
Hey, yo, man, spare some change?

306
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,609
-没办法 -拜托你
- No. - Come on, man.

307
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,083
-不，我没有钱 -你一定有
- No, I'm all tapped out. - I know you got something.

308
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,085
-多少都没关系 -说真的
- I'll take whatever you got. - Seriously.

309
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,247
我刚出狱，有钱我会给你
I just got out of lockup. I would if I could.

310
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,166
-抱歉 -你自认比我高尚吗？
- Sorry. - So you think you're better than me, huh?

311
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,061
-我没有这么想 -等等，你要逃去哪，小子？
- I don't think I'm better than you. - Yo, where you running, little man?

312
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,262
我没有要逃
I'm not running anywhere.

313
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,815
不应该这样才对
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

314
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:18,888
我越狱的原因只是想和 犸丽跟小孩一起生活
The reason I went along with the break was to have a life with Maricruz and my baby.

315
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,160
结果现在呢？ 找份烂工作？
And now what? Get some two-bit job?

316
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,093
随时都得提高警觉？
Always be looking over my shoulder?

317
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,431
这算是哪门子人生？
What kind of life is that?

318
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,205
你可以跟我和林克到巴拿马 展开新生活
You can come with me and Linc to Panama. Start over.

319
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,601
你待在这里越久
The longer you stay here...

320
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,573
逃到巴拿马的机会就越小
...the more the chance there is you'll never make it to Panama.

321
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,405
你还有其他人要照顾
You got other people to think about.

322
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,639
你哥、侄子
Your brother. Your nephew.

323
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,715
莎拉
Sara.

324
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,353
-她会和你在那里会合吧？ -不知道
- She's meeting you down there, isn't she? - I don't know.

325
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,355
我们没谈过这件事
We never talked about it.

326
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,684
-不过你很希望 -别说了好吗？
- But you're hoping. - Give it a rest, will you?

327
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,825
警犬确定发现两种味道会合
Dogs locked in, We got two trails merging,

328
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,053
他们来过这里 往西前往卓克牧场
They were here, headed towards Drucker Ranch.

329
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,391
他们离开道路了 所有额外小队
They've gone off-road. Any additional units...

330
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,830
要从方圆一里外 开始包围他们
,,, we need to set up a one-mile perimeter and then start closing in,

331
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,535
水变深了
It's getting deeper.

332
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,439
对，有一点
Yeah, a little.

333
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,002
这该死的树干怎么还不动？
So how come this freaking tree ain't moving yet?

334
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,480
我去看看
Let me check.

335
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,085
你没事吧？
You all right?

336
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,961
听着，麦可
Look, Michael...

337
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,563
如果你要继续逃，我可以谅解
...I understand if you have to keep going, you know?

338
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,461
闭嘴，我不会丢下你
Just shut up. I'm not going anywhere.

339
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,228
-不，你仔细想想 -如果我走，你会淹死
- No, look, just think about it. - Lf I leave, you drown.

340
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,631
我知道，但K
I know, but just...

341
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,738
水位已经升高了，苏克
The water level's getting higher, sucre.

342
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,307
你可以憋气几秒？45秒？
How many seconds can you hold your breath? Forty-five?

343
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,377
60秒？ 如果我离开，你就只能活这么久
Sixty? That's how long you've got to live if I take off.

344
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,572
你留下来又能活多久？ 直到警犬和警察赶到？
How long you have if you stay? Till the dogs lead the cops here?

345
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:54,742
-你的建议不能采纳 -听着，我不是想逞英雄
- What you're suggesting is not an option. - I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.

346
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,356
我们心知肚明 现在只有两种结果
We both know there are only two things that can happen now.

347
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,348
丢下我
Leave me here...

348
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,556
或是两人一起被逮捕
...or we both get caught.

349
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,218
-布鲁斯？ -莎拉
- Bruce? - Sara.

350
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,685
我们说好不打手机 但我需要知道你是否平安
I know we said not to use this number, but I needed to know you were okay.

351
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,791
我的司机去接你 结果那里成了犯罪现场
My driver went to pick you up and the place was a crime scene.

352
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,791
对，他在电话旁看到的女人
The woman that he saw by the payphone...

353
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,452
原本应该是我死在那
...that was supposed to be me.

354
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,292
我得丢下她，我不知道该怎么办
And I had to leave her there, I didn't know what to do,

355
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,230
他们到底是谁？ 他们完全知道我会站在哪
Who are these people? They knew where I was gonna be standing.

356
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,370
他们完全知道我会K
They knew exactly where I was gonna be...

357
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,668
-莎拉？你在吗？ -是你
- Sara? You there? - It was you.

358
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,867
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

359
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,535
-告诉我你在哪里 -天啊
- I just need to know where you are, - oh, my God.

360
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,567
（急诊室）
Excuse. We'd like to check on a friend of ours, L.J. Burrows.

361
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,471
抱歉，我们想找一个朋友 罗杰柏劳

362
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,442
-他在缝合伤口 -我们只想看他是否平安
- He's getting stitches. - We wanna make sure he's all right.

363
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,173
等缝完就能见他，这是规定
And you can see him when he's through. It's policy.

364
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,079
-你真的听不懂 -我明白那小孩是自卫
- You don't get it. - I get that that kid defended himself.

365
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,243
-告诉我们你为何攻击他 -我说过了
- Tell us why you attacked him. - I told you.

366
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,321
-有人付钱叫我打他 -有人付钱
- Some guy paid me to. - Some guy paid you.

367
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,821
-当然 -调查局
- Yeah, of course he did. - FBI.

368
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,290
-有人付钱给你是什么意思？ -你觉得呢？
- What do you mean, somebody paid you? - What the hell's it sound like, man?

369
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,919
有个人给我50元 叫我揍那小孩一顿
Some dude gave me 50 bucks to give the kid a beat down.

370
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,464
是柏劳，他在这里
It's Burrows. He's here.

371
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,773
你好吗，小拳击手？
How you feeling, slugger?

372
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,102
爸？
Dad?

373
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,936
我们得走了
We gotta move.

374
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,373
医院警卫请至3G栋
Hospital security, Wing 3-G,

375
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,951
医院警卫请至3G栋
Hospital security, Wing 3-G,

376
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,435
-什么也不能做 -天啊
- There's not much you can do. - Oh, boy.

377
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,695
打扰了，女士们，我有事要问你
Excuse me, I need to ask you a few questions.

378
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,069
我是后续调查小组，请失陪
I'm on the follow-up investigation team. Excuse me.

379
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,971
-走吧，待会见 -我们只是想知道
- Gotta go. See you later. - We were just curious.

380
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,307
你有见到那些犯人 找到要的东西了吗？
Did you see if the convicts actually found what they were digging for?

381
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,578
不，可是听起来像挖到了
No, but it sure sounded like they did.

382
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,047
那个西班牙人 带着我女儿的露营袋离开
The spaniard, he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs...

383
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,215
让其他人惊慌失措
...and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.

384
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,657
听起来好像他摆了他们一道
Sounded like he screwed them over something fierce.

385
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,296
他们就这样让他走？
And they just let him leave?

386
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,165
他们并不高兴，可是就让他离开
Well, they weren't happy about it, but yeah.

387
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,925
他骑着机车走了
He took off on his motorbike.

388
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,161
-几分钟后他们也走了 -一起吗？
- Then they left a few minutes later. - Together?

389
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,363
不，长相清秀的那个跟黑人 他们先离开
No, the pretty one and the black fellow, they left first.

390
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,134
然后那恶心的南方人 从后门溜走
And then that dirty southerner, he snuck out the back.

391
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,643
可是他的动作很慢 因为背包很重
But he was moving kind of slow, you know, with the weight of that backpack.

392
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,475
-他的手又残废K -等等，他也拿着背包？
- And that disability that he... - Wait, he had a backpack too?

393
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,640
对，他回屋子里
Yes. He came back in...

394
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,618
出去前把这个 塞进了我的内衣
...and slipped this into my brassiere on his way out.

395
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,485
他说是用来赔偿损失的
He said it was to cover the damages.

396
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,661
我们得把钱留下当证物
Well, we're gonna need to keep this as evidence.

397
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,729
感谢你，上车吧
Thanks for your time. Get in the car.

398
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,008
736、空格
Seven-three-six, space,,,

399
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,780
339、空格、8687
...three-three-nine, space, eight-six-eight-seven.

400
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,210
你要找什么？
And what exactly are you looking for?

401
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,447
模式、密码
A pattern. A code.

402
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,782
什么都好
Anything.

403
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,517
你要告诉我什么，麦可？
What? What are you trying to tell me, Michael?

404
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:32,289
有人说两人会认识 一定是有原因的
They say people come into your life for a reason.

405
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:38,965
也许我注定要 帮你逃出福克斯河
Maybe my reason was to help you get out of Fox River, you know?

406
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,766
-帮助你救你哥一命 -不是的
- To help you save your brother. - No.

407
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,679
没关系，老哥
It's okay, papi.

408
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,683
我就算了吧
Let me go.

409
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,714
我们就快抵达 水库下流的河流边
We're a quarter mile downriver below the dam,

410
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,957
这是最后机会了，麦可
It's now or never, Michael.

411
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,094
-我要你憋气，好吗？ -为什么？
- I want you to hold your breath, okay? - Why?

412
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,396
照做就对了，我保证马上回来
Just do it. I'll be right back, I promise.

413
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,391
你要做什么？
What the hell are you doing?

414
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,622
所有小队，前往河边
All units, redirect to the river,

415
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,254
我要你潜进水中 再把手举高伸出水面
I want you to go under and then stick your arm up above the water, high.

416
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,025
好
All right.

417
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,929
等快没空气的时候 前后挥动，让我可以看到
Then when you start running out of air, wave it back and forth so I can see it.

418
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,835
-好 -我就会回来救你
- Okay. - And I'll come back and get you.

419
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,339
懂吗？把手给我
Okay? Give me your hand.

420
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,302
一、二K
One, two...

421
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,244
三
...three.

422
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,817
快点K
Come on. Come on.

423
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,126
苏克？
Sucre?

424
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,801
苏克！
Sucre!

425
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,536
-说吧 -是有一种可能
- Talk to me. - Well, there is one possibility...

426
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,733
但是现在判定还太早
...but it's almost too rudimentary.

427
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,901
我们知道这不是电话号码
We know we're not looking at a phone number...

428
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,980
但也许根本不是数字
...but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.

429
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,047
重点是和数字相对应的字母
What's important are the letters that correspond to that number,

430
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,652
三个点，第三个字母KR
Three dots, third letter: R.

431
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,656
两个点KD、E
Two, D, E.

432
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,064
一个数字有三种可能
Three possibilities per number,

433
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,170
可能的字母组合有上千组
That's thousands of letter combinations,

434
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,004
但只有一组拼出字来
But only one of them spells out a word,

435
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,170
（集合地点）

436
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,179
重点是，地点在哪里？
The question is where?

437
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,355
（1799元，好车）

438
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:05,167
-你好，需要什么吗？ -有四个轮子和油门的
- Hey, what are you in the market for? - Four wheels and a gas pedal.

439
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,702
彼提，是我
Hey, Petey, it's me.

440
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,705
我有事要对你说
Listen, I got something to tell you.

441
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,776
我才在纳闷你何时会打给我
I was wondering when you were gonna call.

442
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,678
好K上次见面后 发生了很多事
Yeah. A lot has come down since we last talked, and...

443
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,377
我知道，我听说了，被你毁了
Yeah, I know, I heard, You ruined it,

444
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,282
对K
Yeah...

445
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,784
-这么快就听说了？ -老哥，大家都知道了
- You heard already? - Well, brother, everybody's heard, man.

446
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,190
我告诉你，赫特气死了
And let me tell you something, man. Hector is pissed.

447
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,331
-关赫特什么事？ -那是他的婚礼
- What does Hector have to do with it? - It was his wedding.

448
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,333
-等等，不然你要说什么事？ -你的机车，你又在说什么？
- Wait a minute. What are you talking about? - Your bike. What are you talking about?

449
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,664
-婚礼 -婚礼怎么了？
- The wedding. - What about the wedding?

450
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,033
到了要说“我愿意”的时候
Well, you know the part where you say "I do"?

451
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,804
犸丽竟然说“我不愿意”
Maricruz said, "I don't."

452
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,512
-真的？ -她让那家伙独自呆站在教堂里
- She did? - Left homeboy standing at the altar,,,

453
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:54,139
像个呆子，你懂我的意思吧？
,,, holding his Spam in his hand, if you know what I'm saying,

454
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
你说我的机车怎么了？
What were you telling me about my bike?

455
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,853
好，我拿钥匙给你
All right. I'll go get your keys.

456
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,487
我们有几个地方要去 第一站要去叫布兰丁的地方
We've got a couple of stops to make. First, there's this place call Blanding.

457
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,430
-几天后再与林克会合K -我不能去
- We meet up with Linc in a couple of days... - I can't go.

458
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,370
她拒绝了，老哥
She said no, papi.

459
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,338
犸丽K拒绝了K
Maricruz... Maricruz told that son of a...

460
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,670
那个浑蛋，你能相信吗？
she told him no. Can you believe that?

461
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,211
-这样很好 -没错
- That's great. - I know.

462
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,482
现在我K
Now, I just...

463
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,176
没关系，去找你的女友
No, go on. Get your girl.

464
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,344
-我们说好去巴拿马K -以后吧
- How about Panama? We said... - some other time.

465
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,717
巴拿马又不会跑掉
Panama's not gonna go anywhere.

466
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,622
还有这个K之后要是遇上麻烦 可以派上用场
And this is in case you run into trouble down the road.

467
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,337
在河里
The river.

468
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,933
我要你丢下我
I told you to leave me behind.

469
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,903
对，我试过了K
Yeah, well, I tried.

470
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,341
可是我被绳子缠住逃不了，所以K
But, you know, I got tangled up in the rope, so...

471
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,580
-好，钥匙来了 -谢谢，还有K
- okay, here you go. - Thanks. And...

472
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,783
我们还需要一辆车
Think we'll need another car.

473
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,791
你真的认为钱被恋童癖独吞？
Do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?

474
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,434
要确定只有一种方法
Only one way to find out.

475
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,571
如果你是包威，拿到五百万
If you're Bagwell and you just got your hands on $5 million...

476
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,968
你会去哪里？
...where would you go?

477
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,264
（苏珊贺兰德 米贝瑞山庄1605号）

478
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,527
你以为只有你感到被人背叛？
You think you're the only one that feels betrayed?

479
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,532
我总有一天会出狱
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

480
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,133
等我出去K
And when I do...

481
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:01,171
别以为我会忘记你家门前的模样
...don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.

482
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,155
让我搞清楚 你付钱请那疯子揍我一顿？
Let me get this straight. You paid that meth head to whup my ass?

483
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,995
对，调查局在等我靠近你 这是唯一的办法
Yeah. Feds were waiting for me to come get you. It was the only way.

484
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,727
-奏效了不是吗？ -对
- It worked, didn't it? - Yeah.

485
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,031
对，害我缝了四针
Yeah, it got me four stitches.

486
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,005
这样比较有性格，拿去
Adds character. Here, take that.

487
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,372
里面有冰块，放在眼睛上
There's some ice in there. Put it on the eye.

488
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,639
可以消肿
Keep the swelling down.

489
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,849
我年轻时也曾打过架
I've been in a few fights in my day too.

490
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,085
太多次了
Too many.

491
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:53,991
（集合地点、日落、热）
"Rendezvous. Sundown. Hot."

492
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,418
还有一只纸鹤
There's one more bird.

493
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,499
每个角落打扫干净 要像她没回家过，快
Clean it. Every surface, like she never came home. Go.

494
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,362
在等你从犹他州飞回来时
Waiting for your flight from Utah...

495
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,725
我们有多余时间作审查
...we had a little extra time for due diligence.

496
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,197
我便更深入调查了你的背景
I decided to dig a little deeper on your history.

497
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,733
或者该说背景的匮乏
Or rather lack of one.

498
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,964
你的出身平凡，家境贫困 母亲宣称因家暴而离家
Starts off simple enough. Poor family. Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.

499
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,975
不过你父亲竟然得到监护权 从这些幼童医疗纪录来看
Somehow your dad holds on to custody, and by the look of these pediatric meds...

500
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,909
接下来四年他常对你拳打脚踢
...he beat you like a harp seal for the next four years.

501
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,414
你大受打击，没钱又受虐 未来无从选择，只能从军
Big shock: Poor abused kid, not a lot of options, he joins the military.

502
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,747
你是真的有问题 还是来炫耀的？
Will there be any actual questions or is this just a show-and-tell?

503
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,446
好，我想到一题 一个小步兵
Okay, I got one. How does a guy go from Infantry grunt...

504
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,455
绩效又不杰出
...with less than stellar marks...

505
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:32,289
怎么有能耐晋升波湾特别部队 然后到调查局
...to the Gulf I special ops, to the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

506
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,557
主导侦办本国 最大宗的越狱案件？
...leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?

507
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,133
资料都在我手上
I have all these dots.

508
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,794
可是因果我都连不起来
And there's just no way to connect them.

509
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,266
看来你得想办法提升层级
Looks like you need to work on your clearance level, Dick.

510
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,672
-我从你身上下手就好 -你想这么做？
- Maybe I'll just work on you. - You wanna do this?

511
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,541
我会把你绑在桌上 直到问出有用的答案为止
I will chain you to this desk until I get answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.

512
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,079
你确定要这么做？
You sure you wanna do this?

513
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,877
我知道军方在海外 叫你做什么勾当，亚历
I know what they tell you to do overseas, Alex...

514
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,015
让我清楚告诉你
...and let me make it perfectly clear.

515
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,248
美国本土上不能这么做
We do not do it on American soil.

516
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,153
长官，有你的电话
Sir, there's a phone call for you.

517
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,691
我待会再接
I'll take it later.

518
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,056
长官，你可能会想现在接
Sir, you're gonna wanna take this now.

519
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,130
是的
Yeah?

520
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,066
是，长官
Yes, sir.

521
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,342
我和他在一起
I'm with him now.

522
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,512
是，长官，再见
Yes, sir. Bye.

523
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,186
你要去哪里？
Where you going?

524
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,912
我以为我们谈得正起劲呢
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.

525
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,487
我们走
Let's go.

526
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,208
亚历
Alex.

527
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,573
你有东西要给我吗？
You got something for me?

528
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,376
打开它
Open it.

529
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,389
这些数字和电话上的字母相对应
The numbers correlate to the letters on a phone.

530
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,460
不过这组的字母 组合都不合理
Only on this one, none of the possible combinations make sense.

531
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,564
我们认为应该是和 史柯菲见面的地点
We think it's a location. A rendezvous point for Michael scofield.

532
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,962
只要你查出来，就能找到他
You find it, you find him.

533
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,400
你应该早点把我救出来的
You could've gotten me out of there sooner.

534
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,731
就连我们也得透过特定管道
Even we have to go through certain channels...

535
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,966
才能办好事让外界不起疑心
...to make sure things appear on the up-and-up.

536
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,702
你应该很了解吧，亚历？
You know all about that, don't you, Alex?

537
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,073
要把表面功夫做好
Keeping up appearances.

538
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,747
很好
Good.

539
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:39,517
我只是想确定 逮捕行动的方向没有变
I'm just making sure that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.

540
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,783
我能了解抓柏劳 和史柯菲背后的原因
You know, I understand the reasoning behind Burrows and scofield.

541
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,486
可是其他人虽说是罪犯
But the other men, criminals that they may be...

542
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,997
-但从他们的资料里看不出K -我们请你做好工作
...there's nothing in their profiles... - You've been hired to do a job.

543
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,797
原因不关你的事
The reasoning does not concern you.

544
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,700
你不质疑我们
You don't ask any questions about us...

545
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,673
我们就会继续 确保别人不质疑你，听清楚了吗？
...maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks questions about you. Are we clear?

546
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,939
他们都得死
They all die.

547
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,783
他们都得死
They all die.
