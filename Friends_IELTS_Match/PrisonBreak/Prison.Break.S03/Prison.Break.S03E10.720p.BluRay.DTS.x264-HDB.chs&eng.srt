1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,930
一个普通的渔夫怎么对 这公司这么了解?
How does a simple fisherman know so much about the company?

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,160
你到底干还是不干?
You gonna do this or not?

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,180
干 不过一旦我们出去了 你就是我们的担保了
Yes,but once we're out,I consider you collateral.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,130
林肯惹的祸比他解决的问题还多
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,250
他必须靠自己逃脱 我觉得你可以帮他
He needs to get way,and I think you can assist him.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,310
我只要领先一步 你就能拿到5万
I stay one step ahead,and you get 50 grand.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,920
怎么了?
What happened?

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,310
和你说的一样 她来找我了
She came up to me just like you said

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
给了我一笔钱 叫我在背后说你坏话
and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,310
-那么你还是按计划执行 对吗? -当然
-So we stick to the plan,right? -Yeah.

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,070
很好
Cool.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,500
我发现了一本护照
I found a passport.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,760
格雷・米勒是谁?
Who's gary miller?

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,920
我在想办法让我们两个在一起
I've been working on a way for us to be together.

15
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,700
詹姆斯 你叫我怎么相信你?
James,how-how can I believe you?

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,950
你让我如何再去相信你?
How can I believe anything anymore?

17
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,500
我们找到办法从这儿出去了吗?
we got a way out of this?

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,610
我们必须给地道找个支撑物
We need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,670
不然呢?
Or what?

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,000
不然地道会塌陷 我们会被活埋的
Or the whole thing collapses,and we're buried alive.

21
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,900
不用找借口了
No more excuses.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,400
帕帕的死都是因为这个美国佬
Papa's dead because of this yankee.

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,380
我要亲手杀了他
I'll kill him myself *****

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,800
除非他从笼子里生还了
if I hav he survived the box.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,280
那又怎么样?
So what?

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,210
狱警盯上了斯科菲尔德
The guards went after scofield.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,750
但赢的人是斯科菲尔德
Scofield won.

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,680
现在他是这儿的英雄了
He's a folk hero now.

29
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,630
听着 我和你一样都 非常想把斯科菲尔德干掉
Look,I want scofield dead as much as you,

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,100
但绝不会以起义为代价
but not at the cost of an uprising.

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,370
你的信
Mail call.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,390
那人是谁?
Who's that?

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,770
是我儿子
That's my son.

34
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,240
伯格威尔说一切安全
Bagwell gave the okay.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,750
暂时没人
The coast is clear.

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,360
我们得走了
We gotta go.

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,400
我没想到还能再见到你
I didn't think I'd see you again.

38
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,150
只要有人走进那笼子里 就会 
Once someone goes into the box,it'S 

39
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,530
那是一场误会
it was a misunderstanding.

40
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,380
他们想和你谈谈直升机的事 对吗?
They wanted to talk to you about the helicopters,right?

41
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,010
什么直升机?
What h were ****

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,080
你们真的打算逃出去?
you really trying to escape?

43
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,640
我不知道你在说什么 我想你自己也不知道吧
I don't know what you're talking about,and neither do you.

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,410
跟你说个事 伯格威尔跟我们一起走
Just so you know,bagwell's coming with us.

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,480
你当时不在
You were gone.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,640
他有我们需要的东西 我没别的办法
He**** we needed. I didn't have a choice.

47
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,110
好的
Fine.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,020
那么新的计划是什么?
So what's the new plan?

49
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,480
-你告诉他了吗? -是的
-Did you tell him? -Yeah.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,830
我要跟着你走
I am coming with you.

51
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,560
我无所谓
Okay by me.

52
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,930
大家都听到了吗? 你听到了吗? 警官
Everyone heau hear that,lawman?

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,150
但是你得待在这里
But you're staying up here.

54
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,520
我想我刚才说的还不够清楚
Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,670
楼下的工作需要两只手
The work downstairs requires two hands.

56
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,750
嘿
Hey.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,490
我们需要有人待在外面 以防萨米回来
We need somebody to stay outside in case sammy returns.

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,770
我还以为我们没法凿穿这玩意儿
I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff.

59
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,040
找跟柱子撑住是关键
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,810
除非地道有适当的物体进行支撑 不然会全部坍塌下来
Unless the tunnel gets the proper support,it's all going to come down on our heads.

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,440
我们该找些做支撑的材料
We should have the materials for the braces,

62
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,320
但是我们得找把锯子 把它们锯成合适的大小
but we'll need a a saw to cut them to size.

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,360
还要把锤子
And a hammer.

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,940
你能帮我们解决这问题吗?
Can you help us out?

65
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,100
好的 交给我吧
Yeah. I can do that.

66
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,320
只有2天
Two days.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,740
如果不行呢?
And if not?

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,650
只有2天
two days

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,120
古勒莫应该备好了我们需要的一切
Guillermo should have everything we need.

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,130
你知道他在哪儿 对吗?
You know where he is,right?

71
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,670
我觉得 呃 
I think it's,uh 

72
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,740
在这条走廊的左边
it's down this corridor on the left.

73
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,050
走到走廊中间部分
Halfway down.

74
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,930
40号牢房
Cell 40.

75
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,820
沿走廊走 靠左手边 40号牢房
Down the corridor on the left. Cell 40.

76
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,570
没问题
Okeydoke.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,930
你是不是已经迷路了? 西奥多
Are you lost already,teodoro?

78
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,580
不是
No.

79
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,540
不过迷路的是你
But you are.

80
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,080
越狱 第三季 第10集
This is my room now.

81
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,920
这个房间现在归我了
You're done in here.

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,810
这儿已经没你的事了
If you had gone after scofield today,all would have been forgiven.

83
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,410
如果今天你抓了斯科菲尔德 那还可以原谅
This is suicide.

84
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,370
你这是在自杀
Shut up,old man 

85
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,150
闭嘴 老东西 
I'll take my chances.

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,100
我会碰碰运气
yeah.You think you can run sona?

87
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,230
是啊 你觉得你管得了索纳?
You couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other,

88
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,170
你连两码头间运货都办不了
but I still keep you by my side.

89
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,480
但我仍然把你留在我身边
I'll let you walk out of here out of respect for what you were.

90
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,080
看在你过去的份上 我会让你离开的
Come on 

91
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,480
快起来 
Get the hell out of here 

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,720
滚出去 
All of you ready to do this?

93
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,170
你们都准备好了?
Until lechero gets back,we should start looking for pieces about four feet in length.

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,670
勒切罗回来前 我们得开始找材料了 像这样4英尺长的
I'm running things now 

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,990
现在开始我是头儿了 
Anyone got a p*****.

96
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,060
如果谁有意见
come get it 

97
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,880
就自己来领鸡爪 
Good.

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,110
非常好
First order of business,

99
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,600
第一件事儿
a case of rum to the man who brings me michael scofield 

100
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,940
谁带迈克尔・斯科菲尔德来见我 这箱朗姆酒就归他 
don't worry

101
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,320
别担心
we'll be there with all the cash

102
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,550
我们会带着钱去那儿的
okay? Gracias.

103
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,790
行了吗? 谢谢
Osberto.

104
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,160
奥斯伯特
That's who you want to talk to.

105
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
他是你们要找的人
This guy on the up-and-up?

106
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
这个人信得过吗?
The guy I was running things into sona for arranged this,

107
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,610
我给索纳安排的事 是这个人帮忙弄的
so it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal.

108
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,390
所以应该信得过
So,yes.

109
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,170
嗯 好吧
Osberto doesn't speak english,though,so how do you want to work it?

110
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,300
奥斯伯特不会说英语 你怎么办?
I need to meet with susan.

111
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,830
我去见苏珊
I'll take sofia. She can translate for me.

112
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,290
我带索菲亚一起去 她能给我当翻译
Don't worry about it.

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,990
这点不用担心
So when I meet with susan,what do you want me to tell her?

114
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,340
那么我见到苏珊的时候 你想让我告诉她什么?
Tell her whatever you think she wants to hear.

115
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,010
她想听什么 你就说什么
Just buy us enough time to do our thing,all right?

116
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,500
只要留给我们足够的时间 让我们干活就行 明白了吗?
Home stretch,papi.

117
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,900
最后关头了
Listen,man. I want to thank you for everything.

118
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,250
听着 伙计 我要感谢你 为了所有的事
Oh,linc,please.

119
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,130
林肯 别这么客气
When we get home,I got your back―

120
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,820
等我们到家了 我会照应你的
whatever you need,whatever you want.

121
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,660
你要什么 我都给你
That won't be necessary.

122
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,350
没这个必要
When I'm back home,I'm a saint.

123
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,020
等我回了家 我简直就是圣人了
I'm not even jaywalking.

124
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,320
连交通规则都不会违反
Osberto. Don't forget.

125
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,230
奥斯伯特 别忘了
Osberto.

126
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,950
奥斯伯特
Scofield steps outside that tunnel,he's a dead man.

127
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,670
斯科菲尔德一旦走出那个地道 他就死定了
Far as I can tell,we have two options.

128
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,260
就我所知 我们有两个选择
We can invite sammy on the escape 

129
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,230
我们能找萨米一起逃跑 
he can go to hell.

130
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,020
他可以去死
Which brings us to option number two.

131
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,880
这样我们就只能选第2个方案了
You wouldn't last a second in there with sammy.

132
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,610
你和萨米在一起 保证一秒都活不到
Would you?

133
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,100
那你呢?
Then I guess we'll just have to outsource.

134
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,750
那么我想我们只能让外人来做了
I felt sorry for the guy,

135
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,670
我为那家伙感到惋惜
but you don't chicken-footan ex-delta force and expect to make it out alive.

136
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,390
但你找一个前三角洲特种兵单挑 那是你自己活该
You're delta force?

137
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,810
你是三角洲特种兵?
Like chuck norris?

138
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,870
就像查克・诺里斯?
Norris? He wouldn't have made it through boot camp.

139
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,670
诺里斯? 他连新兵营都捱不过
Ex *****

140
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,480
打扰一下
I see you're making friends.

141
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,190
看来你在结交新朋友嘛
Hey,once you get the hang of it,this place ain't so rough.

142
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,660
一旦你适应了这里 就不会感到很难受了
Yeah.

143
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,960
是啊
Too bad.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,150
太遗憾了
Too bad what?

145
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,890
什么太遗憾了?
You were right. We got a little plan going on.

146
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,390
你是对的 我们正在密谋一个计划
But,you know,if you're putting down roots 

147
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,360
但是 如果你想要定居 
no,no.

148
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,500
没 没
You were saying 

149
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,030
你刚才说 
We're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours.

150
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,300
我们将在48小时内离开这里
Not through scofield.

151
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,660
不能靠斯科菲尔德
You heard the town crier.

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,680
你听到萨米叫嚣了吧
College boy's life is barely worth a case of booze.

153
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,790
那学生仔的贱命连一箱酒都不值
Hence our current conversation.

154
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,710
正因如此咱们才要谈谈
I know how you got your cherry yesterday,

155
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,410
我知道你昨天是怎么赢的
daubing your wraps in acetone,smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes.

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,640
往你的护腕里抹丙酮 把他熏晕
You do the same thing to sammy,and you're in.

157
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,510
如果你能对萨米这么干 你就加入
Chicken-foot sammy?

158
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,470
鸡爪萨米?
Chicken-foot sammy.

159
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,740
鸡爪萨米
It's all riding on you,champ.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,690
全靠你了 冠军
Thank you.

161
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,100
谢谢
This shouldn't take long.

162
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
很快就好
What are you getting?

163
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,710
你要弄什么东西?
Supplies.

164
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,930
有用的东西
For?

165
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,100
干啥用?
I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.

166
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
我不想再毫无准备
You know what that means?

167
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,040
明白什么意思吗?
No.

168
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,970
不
Well,these people obviously have a plan.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
那帮人肯定有计划
We're gonna need one,too.

170
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,760
咱们也得有个计划
Does that plan include screwing over james?

171
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,850
计划也包括干掉詹姆斯?
Is it james or gary miller?

172
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,990
是詹姆斯还是格雷・米勒?
Whatever his name is,there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them 

173
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,400
不管他叫什么名字 我不愿相信他是为那些人效力的 
'cause he's the man I loved,the man who went to prison for me,

174
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,660
因为他是我所爱的人 为我进监狱的人
the man who was going to take me to my first trip to paris.

175
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,440
要带我去巴黎初次旅行的人
I haven't turned my back to that man.

176
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,260
我不能背叛他
Do I have your word that he's gonna be all right?

177
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,590
你能保证他没事吗?
Yeah.

178
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,730
能
Now get in.

179
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,720
进来吧
Do I have your word? 

180
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,530
你能保证吗?
Yeah,you got my word.

181
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,450

Now get in.

182

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,450
希望你那有所进展 格雷
You nd out?

185
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,330
我刚刚发现
That"sucre"means"sugar."

186
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,950
苏克雷是糖的意思
Yeah.

187
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,940
对
So every time I say your name,I'm calling you"sugar."

188
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,640
所以每次呼唤你的名字 我都叫你甜心
Basically.

189
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,490
叫吧
I like that.

190
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,550
我喜欢那样
Look,I don't have a lot of information.

191
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,460
听着 我的情报不多
Which,I guess,that's good news for you,right?

192
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,190
我猜 这对你来说是好消息吧?
You care to elaborate?

193
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,120
你要详述吗?
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.

194
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,530
林肯没什么鬼点子
He's still planning on exchanging whistler for lj.

195
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,770
他仍打算用惠斯勒换LJ
He hasn't been talking about running any games.

196
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,600
他没提过什么策略
And did he become an eagle scout last night,too?

197
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,250
他昨晚也成了老鹰童子军了?
Lady,he got the message.

198
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,860
小姐 他知道事情的严重性了
He knows he doesn't have a choice,he has to play it straight.

199
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,210
他知道他别无选择 他只能乖乖听从你们
Look,I could have come up here and made something up just to get paid,but 

200
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,730
听着 我完全可以胡编乱造来糊弄你 但 
I'm not trying to get on your bad side either.

201
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,690
但是我也不想加入你那一方
You know what?

202
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,370
知道吗?
I believe you.

203
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,110
我相信你
So,I'll call you if anything comes up.

204
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,080
那 我有事就给你打电话
Whoa,whoa What am I,a toothless crack whore?

205

哇噢 哇噢 难道我是个卑鄙无耻的婊子?
Sit down.

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,690
坐下
I keep my promises.

207
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,110
我信守诺言
Le I work for,they don't like to deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky.

208
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,710
我的上司 他们不喜欢美钞 体积大 不好带
Cashier's check payable to cash.

209
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,070
银行支票可换现金

帮个小忙 
I got it. I said I got it.

217
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,210
可以了 我说可以了
That little piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight?

218
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,610
那一小块金属能承受全部的重量?
All right,let go,let go.

219
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,950
好 放开了 放开
So,how many more are we gonna need before we get to the top?

到顶之前还有多远?
20 maybe.

221
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,150
可能是20
That gets us to no-man's land.

222
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,860
那就能到禁区了
Then what?

223
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,850
然后咋办?
Helicopter'd be nice.

224
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,880
来架直升机不错
Hey,I was supposed to kill you.

225
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,000
我本应该杀了你
Oh,so you're not a fisherman?

226
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,550
哦 那你就不是渔夫喽?
They threatened to come after my family if I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter,

227
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,350
他们威胁我 如果我不杀了你 进直升机 就杀害我的家人
but I didn'T.

228
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,330
但我没那么做
I'm so grateful.

231
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,090
不知道
Maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here.

232
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,980
等咱们出来了也许就知道了
Well,it's a crazy world,isn't it?

233

Better think long and hard before you say another word,eh?

248
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,490

他胡子上有酒味 穿着难看的背心

I've wanted to shank that little calypso kid ever since I first met him.

头一次见那个小瘪三的时候就想揍他
I'm not a violent guy by nature,

255

我生来不是个暴力的人

如果你不打死他 咱们都会死
this isn't the best neighborhood.

00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,240
看起来不妙啊
I've been in a lot worse.

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,680
只不过牵涉的比我告诉你们的还深一点
I'm just maybe a little bit more connected than I've let on.

307
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,600
我觉得这个可以
I think this is gonna work.

308
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,390
嗯
Yeah.

309
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,770
我租船 真的 
You know,I run charters,just like I said 

310
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,460
很多年了
I have for years.

311
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,250
但突然间 那个黑发美女格雷琴・威尔
Then one day,that brunette,gretchen well,

312
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,380
她问我想不想包给她公司干
she asked me if I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation,right?

313
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,890
以她给的钱看
And,uh,well,with the money she was offering,

314
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,260
我知道不是捕三文鱼那么简单
I had a pretty good idea she wasn't just trawling for salmon.

315
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,840
你们俩还有交情啊
So you two have history.

316
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,970
自从那第一份工作起 她就是我生命中彻头彻尾的噩梦
Yeah. And she's been an absolute nightmare in my life ever since that first job.

317
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,180
艾力克斯 我要门楔
Alex,I need a wedge.

318
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,310
门楔
Wedge.

319
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,440
他们要送的东西我已经送到了
Look,I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em.

320
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,040
我得搞明白这些坐标 带回去
I have to figure out these coordinates and I have to take them back there.

321
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,670
别再自寻其辱了
Quit embarrassing yourself.

322
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,560
什么?
What?

323
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,290
我们不是酒吧里的妞 任你钓
We're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up.

324
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,850
-除非你想听? -不
-Unless you need to hear this? -No.

325
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,450
好的 行
All right,good.

326
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,900
你为他们工作
You work for the company.

327
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,830
你逃出去之后
And when you break out of here,

328
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,500
你还得听命于他们 没别的了
you're gonna do whatever the company asks you to do,period.

329
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,440
他们在利用我 就像在利用你们一样
Well,they're using me just like they're using you.

330
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,730
很好 很高兴你告诉我了
Good,I'm glad you shared that with me.

331
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,770
我们还是开工吧
So why don't we go back to work?

332
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,650
行么?
How's that sound?

333
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,990
让那些白痴自己窝里斗去吧
Let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want,huh?

334
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,230
但是如果有人想找我们麻烦 
But if one of them tries to use it on us 

335
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,670
你不用非跟他动手
you don't have to fight that guy.

336
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,940
这是我的告别演出
It's my farewell tour.

337
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,650
剩下的那些都不行
the rest of those pieces are no good.

338
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,800
我们需要那些工具 迈克尔
We're going to need those tools,michael.

339
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,260
我猜我们只能干等了
I guess we'll just have to wait.

340
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,570
那本书 就是一堆坐标 对吧?
That book of yours it's just a bunch of coordinates in there,right?

341
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,220
也有别的东西
Among other things.

342
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,090
那你不会介意 
So you wouldn't mind.

343
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,350
就是一堆数字 日期
It's just a bunch of,uh,numbers and dates.

344
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,570
"大门"
"Gate."

345
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,860
大门网业公司
Gate netting company.

346
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,080
我在那儿租渔网
That's where I rent my trammels.

347
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,240
"惊逃"
"Stampede."

348
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,880
我朋友的渔船
That's my buddy's cape islander.

349
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,350
这跟我们有什么关系?
And this is important to us how?

350
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,260
因为你们看错人了
It's important because I'm being accused of being someone I'm not.

351
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,730
我不想行动的时候 斯科菲尔德又把我甩了 
And I don't want scofield ditching me once it's time to leave 

352
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,920
他谁也不会甩了
he's not ditching anybody.

353
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,590
就算甩人 他也会先甩掉我
If he could have gotten rid of anybody,he would have gotten rid of me.

354
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,410
如果他想逃离本市
And if he tries to leave the city he knows that

355
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,510
他知道在他出市之前 我们就会把他供出去
we're gonna turn him in before he gets out of the city.

356
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,580
我上楼去找勒切罗和器材
I'm going upstairs to find lechero and his equipment.

357
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,480
我跟艾力克斯一起去
I'm with alex.

358
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,560
给我行吗?
Do you mind?

359
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,020
好像上面有人
Sounds like someone's up there.

360
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,660
如果勒切罗被困住了 我们也逃不出去
If lechero gets stranded up there,we're not getting out of here.

361
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,790
你认为什么时候安全了 觉得安全了 我们必须得去 上去
So when you think it's safe,or it feels like it's safe,we got to go,we got to go up.

362
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,810
我们谈论挑战萨米说了几个月了
we've been talking about chickenfooting sammy for months.

363
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,080
没人有那个胆
No one had the courage.

364
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,260
有油漆稀释剂吗?
do you have any paint thinner?

365
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,570
油漆稀释剂?
Paint thinner?

366
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,110
鞋油 打火机油 胶水?
Shoe polish,lighter fluid,glue?

367
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,330
你在这儿啊 老大
There you are,champ.

368
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,120
到点了
It's time.

369
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,920
跺他的脸 布拉德 
Stomp his face,brad 

370
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,280
这是个天大的误会
You know,this has all been one big misunderstanding.

371
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,020
我不是指萨米
I wasn't talking about sammy.

372
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,920
是 是他
It was that's him.

373
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,410
我指的是他
That's the guy I was talking about.

374
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,720
布拉德 我可没看见"古怪的小胡子""丑得要死的背心"
Yeah,I don't see no"fruity moustache,"and where's his"ugly-ass vest,"brad?

375
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,570
别担心 说不定你能赢
Don't worry,you stand a real chance of winning this one.

376
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,440
你不能整天东躲西藏的
you cannot just hide out all day.

377
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,740
我还能怎么样 啊?
What else can I do,huh?

378
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,710
我血腥统治了他们一年
I've ruled these men for a year with blood.

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,180
你觉得他们不想取前任老大的人头?
You don't think those men want to take the head of the man who wore the crown?

380
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,430
可能吧 但萨米就要砍下贝里克的头了
Be that as it may,bellick is about to lose his head to sammy.

381
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,130
这话也许不中听 但要是那样的话
You may not want to hear this,but once that happens,

382
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,370
我们都很清楚自己的下场
we are both very much hell you are.

383
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,440
斯科菲尔德会爬出洞来 直接撞上萨米
He's going to come crawling out of his hole and right into sammy's arms,

384
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,290
我们就再也逃不出去了
and then he and our escape are gone forever.

385
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,670
等等
wait.

386
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,040
拿了工具 立马回去
We get the tools and we come straight back.

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,310
快点
Come on

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,190
你们想看吗?
You guys want to watch the fight?

389
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,110
等下
You know,chill out.

390
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,010
我给你拿瓶酒
I'll get you a beer.

391
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,100

你的人在我手里
Hey,I've got your man out here.

403
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,410
不开门的话 他就倒霉了
If you don't open the door,he's the one who's going to pay the price.

404
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,140
我还用得着他 
I need him alive 

405
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,100
你见到他们了
You saw those guys.

406

你觉得他们会怎么处理我们?
What do you think they've got planned?

407
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,740
你们在考验我的耐心
All of you is trying my patience.

408
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,570
你的建议呢 艾力克斯?
What do you suggest,alex?

409
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,610
我们得准备好
Let's be ready for them.

It's a little thing called a tracing number on the check I gave you.

454
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,110
很明显 你的金融知识掌握的还是不够啊
Apparently your extensive expertise in banking failed you that day.

455
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,150
你匆匆忙忙把所有25000块汇给了
You promptly wired all 25 k to

456
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,250
在芝加哥的玛丽克鲁兹・德尔加多
maricruz delgado in chicago at 123

457
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,030
勿害我大道123号

458
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,020
-我发誓 如果她出了什么事 -如果什么?
-I swear to god,if something happens to her -if what? 

459
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,740
什么 混蛋?
What,jackass? 

460
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,070
你最好回去给我搞点有用的信息
You're going to go back there and you're going to get me some real information,

461
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,250
不然玛丽克鲁兹就要身首异处了
or maricruz and her head are going to part ways.

462
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,820
滚出我的车
Get out of my car.

463

嗨 小白脸
Hey,blanco.

我抓到了你的好伙伴勒切罗
I got your good buddy lechero here.

466
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,260
你干嘛不去敲敲门 好让他知道你来了?
Why don't you give it the secret knock so he know's you,huh?

密码

468
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,300
你怎么会以为我有密码?
What makes you think I have the combination?

469
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,310
照他说的做
Just do what he says.

470
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,220
你还要显摆这东西多少次阿?
How many times you gonna pull that little thing out?

471
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,730
当我觉得必要的时候
As many times as I feel necessary.

472
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,080
你觉得它能让你更强大吗?
What,you think it make you look strong?

473
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,250
它只能放大你的怯懦
All it does is magnify your weakness.

474
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,730
真有趣 我现在倒觉得更安全了
funny,I'm feeling pretty secure right about now.

475
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,560
快说 密码 老不死的
Now,the combination,old man.

476
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,260
我们不会再问一遍
We're not asking again.

你要和他一起越狱?

我打算告诉你这一切的 布瑞达

485
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,870
只是从来没有说出来 是吗?
It just never came up,eh?

486
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,660
拿去吧 这是你的了

但是你哪儿也去不了
But you ain't going nowhere.

00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,020
你们是怎么挖出这个洞的

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,950
答应我 你会带惠斯勒走
Promise me you'll take whistler with you.

493
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,410
你在和我讨价还价?
You making demands on me? Huh?

494
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,890
我了解 
I understand 

495
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,500
为什么你要杀我 但是他什么都没做
why you're going to kill me,but he's done nothing wrong.

带他一起走 我会告诉你一切需要知道的事
I'll tell you everything you need to know,just take him with you.

你会需要他的

498
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,910
是他一个人策划了这一切
He's the only one who figured this one out.

别担心 我会照顾好你朋友的
Don't you worry,I'll take care of your friend.

500
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,170
好吧
All right.

501
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,720
首先 你们要继续搭一些 能支撑住隧道的支架
First,you need to keep building braces to support the tunnel as you go.

502
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,830
你怎么做的?
How you do that?

503

惠斯勒会做给你看的
Whistler can show you how.

504
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,190
看上去你只是用了这些箱子上的木框

就象我说的 惠斯勒会做给你看的

不远了
Not far.

看上去不到十英尺了
Can't be more than ten feet.

不错啊 小白脸
Impressive,blanco.

很可惜你不能享受这个了
too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.

511
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,860
我们会被耽误多久?
how long is this going to set us back?

512
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,040
如果有警卫在无人区看到这个塌陷的大洞 我们就真的有麻烦了
What's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at a giant sinkhole out in no man's land.

513
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,030
迈克尔?
Michael?

我要加入
I'm in.

518
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,590
为什么 就因为你被狠狠的揍了吗?
For what,getting your ass kicked?

519
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,360
不让我加入 我就到屋顶上把一切都抖出来
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.

520
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,260

可以 就两个街区远
Yeah,I'm two blocks away.

526
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:28,010
如果他不带你去巴黎 我会的
If he doesn't take you,I will.

527
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,360
给你 擦擦这个

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,490
-谢谢 -擦那里
-Thanks. -Right there.

529
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,920
你知道吗 你总是让我证明我是个渔夫
You know,for all the times you wanted me to prove I was a fisherman,

530
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,600
我也应该问问你是不是真的工程师
I should have been asking if you were a real engineer.

531
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,650
我们中的一个也许也会被埋在下面
That could've been one of us buried down there.

我不会再让事情失控了
