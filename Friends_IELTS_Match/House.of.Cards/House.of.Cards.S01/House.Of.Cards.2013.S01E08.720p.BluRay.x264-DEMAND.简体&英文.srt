1
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,060
桑蒂诺军事学院  始建于1841年

2
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,820
堆书可控  高效节能
Control stacked, energy-efficient.

3
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,900
话说  全部馆藏估计
Now, mind you, the whole

4
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,280
一个电子阅读器就能装下
collection could probably fit on a Kindle,

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,430
至少下雨时学员们
but at least the cadets will have

6
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,200
又多了个地方躲雨
another placeto get out of the rain.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,950
你对图书馆设计提意见了吗
Did you have any input on the design?

8
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,230
我核准了蓝图
I approved the blueprints.

9
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,610
如果要把我的名字留在上面
If something's gonna have my name on it,

10
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,700
我得保证那东西建得没什么问题
I want to make damn sure they build it right.

11
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,620
我丈夫是把他自己当成建筑师了
I think my husband fancies himself a bit of an architect.

12
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,430
杰弗逊就设计了蒙蒂塞洛庄园
Well, Jefferson designed Monticello.

13
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,250
他还跟自己的奴隶乱搞
And he also fucked his slaves.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,540
幸好我没有奴隶
Luckily, I don't have any,

15
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,590
所以我从没受到过这种诱惑
so that particular temptation hasn't presented itself.

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,980
桑蒂诺[哨兵]学院
The Sentinel...

17
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,830
南卡罗莱纳最好的军事院校
South Carolina's premiere military college.

18
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,010
我在这儿学到了荣誉  职责和尊重的价值
They taught me the values of honor, duty, and respect.

19
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,890
也曾受到戏弄和打击
They also hazed me, tried to break me,

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,840
大四时险遭开除
and, senior year, nearly expelled me

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,360
那年我志愿参与参议员竞选  致使学业荒废
when I volunteered for a Senate Race and my studies suffered.

22
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,050
但30年后  他们还是为新建一座图书馆
But that didn't stop them from soliciting a hefty sum

23
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,660
向我要了一笔巨款
for their new library 30 years later.

24
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,100
在权力和财富的笼罩下
How quickly poor grades

25
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,140
糟糕的成绩就这样被甩在脑后
are forgotten in the shadow of power and wealth.

26
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,090
你这酒杯才一半满嘛  弗兰克
Your drink is only about half as full as it should be, Frank.

27
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,850
你想把我灌醉吗
Are you trying to get me drunk?

28
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:43,920
灌醉  昏倒在水沟里
Drunk, passed out in the gutter,

29
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,600
这样我就能把你妻子偷走了
so I can steal your wife.

30
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,680
你收到邀请步枪手的邮件了吗
Did you get the email about the riflemen?

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,210
-什么邮件  -发自我办公室的邀请邮件
- What email? - From my office about the invitations.

32
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,460
我还希望能见着他们呢
I was hoping they would be here.

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,210
我去查下客人名单
I'll check the list,

34
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,530
但我不记得收过这样的邮件啊
but I don't remember any email.

35
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,850
没关系  只是问一下罢了
Oh, not a problem. I was just wondering.

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,510
真是的  弗兰克  太抱歉了
Well, shit, Frank, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,730
千万别上火
Don't you sweat it for a second.

38
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,110
这样吧  你给我倒点酒  就算补偿我了
In fact, here's how you can make it up to me... freshen my drink.

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,630
没问题
That I can do.

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,690
祝贺你  议员先生
Congratulations, Congressman.

41
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,580
雷米  很高兴在这儿见到你
Remy. Nice to see you here.

42
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,090
格里和桑科的所有同僚都向你问好
Gerry and all the folks at Sancorp give you their regards.

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,740
很遗憾他们不能亲临现场
Well, I'm sorry they couldn't make it.

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,630
克莱尔在哪
Where's Claire?

45
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,720
她一定在哪里婉拒仰慕者呢
Oh, she's here somewhere, fending off admirers.

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,820
桑科对她回绝了他们的捐款感到非常失望
Sancorp was very disappointed she turned down their donation.

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,360
不难想象
I can imagine.

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,630
他们还很关心
And they're also concerned

49
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,070
彼得・罗素竞选州长一事
about Peter Russo running for Governor.

50
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,120
你怎么知道的
Now, how do you know about that?

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
宾州有四分之三的土地
Three quarters of Pennsylvania

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,520
下面有页岩天然气田
sits on top of the Marcellus Shale.

53
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,330
我连谁在竞选州长都不知道
If I can't find out who's running for governor,

54
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,480
那我就配不上他们给的酬劳了
I don't deserve a dime of what they're paying me.

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,230
弗兰西斯・J・安德伍德议员图书馆

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
罗素发起的流域法案
This watershed bill Russo sponsors

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,020
对天然气开采有很多限制
places a lot of restrictions on drilling.

58
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,670
雷米  国会在休息
Remy, congress is in recess,

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,470
这个周末不要谈工作
and this weekend is not about work.

60
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,650
抱歉  你说得很对
I apologize. You are absolutely right.

61
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,900
桑科是你唯一的客户吗
Is Sancorp your only account?

62
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,180
还有不少
I have plenty.

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,260
但其他客户不会为你的图书馆
But my other clients didn't pay for your library

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,640
和我来这儿的机票买单
or my plane ticket down here.

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,650
对你来说正好旅游了
It's a nice little junket for you.

66
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,580
真心希望你能去看看风景
I do hope you're taking in the sights.

67
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,450
这不是我第一次来查尔斯顿了
This isn't my first trip to Charleston.

68
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,450
不是作为我的新闻发言人肯定是第一次
But I'll bet it's your first time not as my press secretary.

69
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,610
没错
It is.

70
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,310
你还邀请了谁
Who else do you have coming in?

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,100
我不想请太多人
I didn't want to pack tonight too much.

72
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,640
要知道  这种宴会通常只招待有钱人
You know, these receptions are usually just for the money people

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,140
比如你
like yourself.

74
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,970
通常来说  现在我该开始絮叨
Normally, this is where I would start to drone on

75
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,370
桑蒂诺学院的历史  理念
about the Sentinel's history, its philosophy,

76
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,470
之类的
its yadda, yadda, yadda.

77
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,550
但我决定明天正式演讲时再讲这些
But I'm going to save that for my big speech tomorrow,

78
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,240
这样你们就不用受两次折磨
and that way I'm not gonna bore y'all to tears twice.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,770
今晚我们要把时间留给
Tonight we're going to turn it over

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,320
一位大家很熟悉的人
to a man who needs no introduction,

81
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,920
我们都清楚他是怎样一个混蛋
because we all know what a son of a bitch he is.

82
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,840
言归正传
Seriously, though,

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,490
弗兰克・安德伍德诠释了
Frank Underwood exemplifies

84
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,860
我们努力灌输给学生的所有美德
all the virtues we try to instill in our graduates.

85
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,720
我们很自豪拥有你样的校友  弗兰克
We're so proud to call you an alumnus, Frank,

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,520
更自豪将你的名字永远留在校园里
and to have your name as a permanent fixture on our campus.

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,080
有请国会议员弗兰克・安德伍德
Congressman Frank Underwood!

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
谢谢你  希金斯校长
Thank you, president Higgins.

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,860
我首先要感谢桑科工业
I first want to thank Sancorp Industries

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,040
为新建图书馆提供资金
for providing the funds to make the library possible.

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,230
我刚成为这里的学员时
When I matriculated here as a young cadet,

92
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,800
吉米・卡特刚当选总统
Jimmy Carter had just been elected president.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,170
毕业以后
After I graduated,

94
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,050
我真希望自己还能待四年
I wished that I could have had another four years,

95
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,570
吉米也是
just like Jimmy.

96
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,980
可惜我们都未能如愿
Well, neither of us got our wish.

97
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,780
但我带着愉快的记忆离开了校园
But I left this campus with fond memories.

98
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,100
我第一次...
The first time I ever...

99
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,860
噢  多希望我在棉花之地*
*Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton

100
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,120
旧时光难以忘怀*
*Old times there are not forgotten

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,270
看吧  看吧  看吧*
*Look away, look away, look away

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,800
我收到你的邮件了
I got your damn email.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
多希望我在迪克西*
*I wish I was in Dixie

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,750
万岁  万岁*
*Hooray, hooray

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,240
在迪克西  我会表明立场*
*In dixieland, I'll take my stand

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,630
生于迪克西  死于迪克西*
*To live and die in Dixie

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,930
走吧  走吧*
*Away, away

108
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,160
走吧  走吧*
*Away, away

109
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,440
一路向南去迪克西*
*Away down South in Dixie

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,670
走吧  走吧*
*Away, away

111
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,550
一路向南去迪克西*
*Away down South in Dixie

112
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,290
穿过蒙特祖玛的长廊*
*From the halls of Montezuma

113
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,650
去往的黎波里的海岸*
*To the shores of Tripoli

114
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,440
我们将为国而战*
*We will fight our country's battles

115
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,900
宝贝孩子
the honey child...

116
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,500
当她走向...
when she stepped out in the...

117
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,000
在《亚特兰大的主妇》里穿上胸罩
trying on the bra on housewives of Atlanta,

118
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,480
我取笑你来着
and I teased you about that,

119
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,950
我说...我叫它宝贝孩子
and I said... I called it the honey child,

120
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,050
因为她就是个宝贝孩子嘛
because she's the honey child now.

121
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,960
总之  问题是...
Anyway, here's the thing...

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,390
灯像这样多久了
How long has that light been like that?

123
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,040
不知道  大概一个月吧
I don't know. A month, maybe.

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,370
没人来修吗
And nobody's come to fix it?

125
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,050
这里没人修任何东西
Nobody don't fix nothing around here.

126
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,650
你问了吗
Well, have you asked?

127
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,520
嘘  我在看电视
Shh. I'm watching.

128
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,740
别管它  我都习惯了
Leave it alone. I'm used to it now.

129
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,020
好多了吧
Better, huh?

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,120
现在太暗了
Now it's too dark.

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,470
你这是干什么
What did you do that for?

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,470
听我说  妈  我要竞选州长
Listen, ma, I'm running for Governor.

133
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,870
再过几天我就要宣布了
I'm going to announce it in a few days.

134
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,640
所以我才来费城
That's why I came up to Philly.

135
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,040
明天有个社区会议
There's a community meeting tomorrow.

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,840
我要向船厂的人介绍一个计划
I'm going to talk to the shipbuilders about a plan

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,730
让他们重新找到工作
to bring their jobs back

138
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,290
这样他们就会在竞选中支持我
so they'll support me in the election.

139
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,970
这些事我一窍不通
I don't know nothing about that stuff.

140
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,310
我听不懂
It's over my head.

141
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,060
好  听我说  你会在新闻里看到
Okay, listen, there's going to be some stories

142
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,010
一些关于我的事
coming out about me in the news...

143
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,510
我的过去
about my past.

144
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,440
我只想给你提个醒
I just wanted to give you a heads-up

145
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,560
让你有个准备
so it doesn't catch you off guard.

146
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,160
我早就不看新闻了  全是垃圾
I don't watch the news no more. A bunch of garbage.

147
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,320
你想看看凯文和萨拉的照片吗
You want to see some pictures of Kevin and Sarah?

148
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,750
太暗了看不清
Too dark to look at pictures.

149
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,280
不不  照片在我手机里  不用...
No, no, no. It's on my phone. You don't need any...

150
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,440
拿远点  我讨厌那些东西
Get it away from me. I hate those things.

151
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,190
会致癌的
Brain cancer.

152
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,360
我是个匠人  有把热胶枪
I'm a crafter, and I have a hot glue gun,

153
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,570
我很会...
and I can very well do this my...

154
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,860
可不仅是在楼上
It wasn't just up the stairs,

155
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,020
要往上走三段楼梯呢
it was up three flights of stairs,

156
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,260
科学馆里面啊
in the science building.

157
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,520
格肯海默怎么说的来着
And Guckenheimer, what did he did...

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,030
"您今天美极了  州长夫人"
"Well, you look lovely today, Mrs. Governor."

159
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,630
然后那畜生竟然大便了
And the thing took a dump.

160
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,510
没错  他们后来一直没能要回来...
Right. And they couldn't get it back...

161
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,960
牵头牛上三段楼容易
You can get a cow up three flights of stairs,

162
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,090
牵下来就难了
but you can't get it down.

163
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,110
所以安迪才问
And that's why Andy said...

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,500
"晚餐想吃牛排吗"
"Who wants steak for dinner?"

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,150
-聊得怎么样  -高兴极了
- How are you boys doing? - We're good.

166
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,630
-你觉得我胖吗  -别理他
- You think I'm fat? - Take the Fifth.

167
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,400
我说真的  菲尔说我是老来发福
Seriously, Phil, here, thinks I got fat with old age.

168
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,050
那是宰相肚里能撑船
Ah, you're a big man with an even bigger heart.

169
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,140
听到了吧
There you go.

170
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,660
她是说你很丰满
She said you're chubby.

171
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,360
弗兰克  我先回酒店了
Frank, I'm going to go back to the hotel.

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,840
玩得开心点
Okay? Have fun.

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,850
-我爱这女人  -是啊
- I love this woman. - Yeah, she...

174
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,280
可别让他捅娄子
Don't let him get into too much trouble.

175
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,920
和我们几个鬼混一晚
They'll have grounds for impeachment

176
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,660
他就该被弹劾了
when we're done with him.

177
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,730
趁他们没关张再去弄点酒吧
Better get another drink before they close up.

178
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,750
你跟我去搬
You're coming with me to help carry them.

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,400
今晚你就是侍应生了
You're gonna be a waiter tonight.

180
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,900
真是懒鬼学员  懒鬼学员
Lazy-ass cadet. Lazy-ass cadet.

181
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
兄弟  等一下
Yeah, hold on a second there, partner.

182
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,190
你完全不知道我们会来吗
You had no idea we were coming?

183
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,510
完全是个惊喜
Complete surprise.

184
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,640
我还以为希金斯会
I thought Higgins might have...

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,840
没有  他装得可像了
No, he played it perfectly.

186
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,160
让我以为你们压根不会来
Made me think you weren't coming at all.

187
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,810
开玩笑吧  我们绝对不会错过的
Are you kidding? We wouldn't have missed it for the world.

188
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,970
图书馆上是写"弗兰克"还是"弗兰西斯"
On the library, are they going to put "Frank" Or "Francis"?

189
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,230
"弗兰西斯"  和我国会大厦
Francis. It's the same as the name

190
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,100
办公室门上的铭牌一致
above the door in my office in the Capitol.

191
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,270
"弗兰西斯"确实更适合命名图书馆
"Francis" is better for libraries.

192
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,830
"弗兰克"更适合作宣传贴纸
"Frank" is better for bumper stickers.

193
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,230
我还真那么干过
I got a few of those.

194
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,490
还有人喊你弗兰西斯吗
Does anybody ever actually call you Francis?

195
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,350
只有克莱尔这么叫我
Claire does. She's the only one.

196
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,430
她真是位难得的佳偶
She seems like a real prize.

197
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,350
的确
She is.

198
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,470
酒吧都关了  但看我拿到了什么好东西
Bar was already shut down, but look what I scored.

199
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,550
你好  卡洛琳
Hi, Caroline.

200
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,580
-你来干什么  -保罗在吗
- What do you want? - Is Paul around?

201
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,490
保罗  是你让他来的吗
Paul? Did you invite this man?

202
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,580
回答我  是你让他来的吗
Answer me. Did you invite him?

203
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,920
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,170
卡洛琳  别说了
Caroline, stop!

205
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,540
不  我就要说
No, you're not going to stop me.

206
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,710
保罗  有时间聊聊吗
Paul? You got a minute to talk?

207
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,270
没什么好聊的
There's nothing to talk about.

208
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,300
我想为上次在华盛顿的时候
I want to apologize for when I saw you last time

209
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,330
我的恶劣态度向你道歉
in Washington, how I treated you.

210
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,470
就这样吗
Is that it?

211
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,740
我还想和你谈谈船厂的事
And I want to talk about the shipyard.

212
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,120
我想到了补救的办法
I got a plan to fix it.

213
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,520
别把所有钱都放在个人退休账户里
You don't want everything going into the Roth IRA.

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,030
每年只要五千到一万
5, 10 grand a year,

215
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,130
我帮你做个多元化的好投资
I'll set you up with a nice, diversified package.

216
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,770
风险小  收益高
Low-risk, high-yield.

217
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,190
克莱尔和我能打理好
I think Claire and I have things pretty well under control.

218
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,400
如果连资深国会议员都投资我的基金
If I brought a senior U.S. Congressman into the fund,

219
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,170
那我在公司可就牛气多了
that would really up my stock in the company.

220
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,130
你们在那儿聊什么呢
What are you all gabbing about back there?

221
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,820
我们在聊老图书馆
We're talking about the old library.

222
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,770
是啊  要怎么处理它啊
Yeah, what's happening to it?

223
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,960
会拆掉吗
They gonna tear it down?

224
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
不知道  
I don't know.

225
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,820
他们可以翻修这地方
They could gut it.

226
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,470
把它改造成学生活动中心
They could turn it into a student center.

227
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,910
我们溜进去吧
We should sneak in there.

228
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,800
就像以前那样
Like we used to.

229
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,770
-我参加  -就这么定了
- I'm game. - Do it.

230
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,620
何乐而不为呢
Hell, why not?

231
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,820
好了  就是这样  能进了
That's it. There you go. That's it.

232
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,860
安静点  这可是图书馆
Shh. It's a library.

233
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,670
这里可是桑蒂诺
This is the Sentinel...

234
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
造船厂协会存了三百万美元
The association had about 3 million saved up

235
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,930
以备不时之需
in reserve for emergencies.

236
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,340
平分给一万两千人  每人所得寥寥无几
Split that up between 12,000 members, it's nothing.

237
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,670
仅够几周的食品杂货
A couple of weeks' groceries.

238
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,150
我在忙一项法案
There's a bill I'm working on.

239
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,460
大笔联邦政府资金投入修建公园绿地
Major federal funds going towards public parks,

240
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,900
绿色商业空间  以及清理垃圾场
green commercial spaces, cleaning up waste sites.

241
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,470
那就有建设工程  公园管理  零售
That's construction jobs, park management, retail...

242
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,910
-能带来多少岗位  -五千个
- How many? - 5,000 jobs.

243
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,290
-都不到一半  -这是个开始
- That's not even half. - It's a start.

244
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,510
-要多久  -一年  或者两年
- How soon? - A year, maybe two.

245
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,110
要两年
Two fucking years?

246
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,890
在那之前我们该怎么办
What are we supposed to do until then?

247
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,710
听着  明天有一场社区会议
Listen, there's a community meeting tomorrow.

248
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,380
我听说了
I heard.

249
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,940
我会把一切都详细说明
I'm gonna go over everything in detail.

250
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,630
-你会出席吗  -没这个打算
- You gonna be there? - Wasn't planning on it.

251
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,020
我希望你能去
I'd like you to be there.

252
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,960
大家都尊敬你
Everybody respects you.

253
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,500
想让我为你做担保
Want me to vouch for you?

254
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,440
听着  告诉你一件事
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that

255
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,170
只有少数几个人知道
only a handful of people know.

256
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,680
我要竞选州长
I'm running for governor.

257
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,390
不久就要宣布了
I announce soon.

258
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,850
但在此之前  我需要造船厂协会的支持
But I need the association behind me before I do that.

259
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,520
我知道  造船厂的事我让你们失望了
Now, I know I let you down with the shipyard.

260
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,030
但如果我成功当选州长
But if I win a governor's race,

261
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,650
我就能让一切重回正轨
I can get everything back on track.

262
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,450
你跑到我家来  求我原谅你
You show up on my doorstep asking for my forgiveness.

263
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,710
我都失业了  你想让我给你当宠物狗
Now you want me to be your lapdog after I lost my fucking job?

264
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,220
这份流域法案仅仅是个开始
This watershed bill is just the beginning.

265
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,530
如果我当上州长  我能做更多
If I'm governor, there's so much I can do.

266
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,540
都是胡说  你就是想利用我
It's bullshit. You just want to use me.

267
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,580
不是那样的
It's not like that.

268
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,590
就是这么回事
Yeah. It's exactly like that.

269
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,040
老天呐  彼得
Jesus Christ, Pete.

270
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,430
你们这群该死的政客
You fucking politicians.

271
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,150
保罗
Paul.

272
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,570
克莱尔
Claire.

273
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,560
没想到你和弗兰克也住这里
I didn't realize you and Frank were staying here.

274
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,530
每次来查尔斯顿我们都住这里
We always stay here when we're in Charleston.

275
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,750
你知道的  雷米
You know that, Remy.

276
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,490
08年竞选
The '08 campaign.

277
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,440
我发誓这纯属巧合
I promise it was a coincidence

278
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,140
是我助理订的
my assistant booked it.

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
弗兰克在吗
Is, uh, Frank around?

280
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,550
他不在  去和老同学狂欢了
He's not. He's off cavorting with old classmates.

281
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,590
过来坐下喝一杯吗
You want to sit down and have a drink?

282
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,030
他们给我订了蜜月套房
They booked me the bridal suite.

283
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,950
有冰镇香槟
There's champagne on ice.

284
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,330
天啊  自从离开了弗兰西斯
My, my, you've grown very confident

285
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,690
你变得很自信啊
since you worked for Francis.

286
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,410
我一直很自信  克莱尔
I've always been confident, Claire.

287
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,680
要是从前  你可绝不会邀我上楼
Oh, you never would have invited me upstairs.

288
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,060
以前没住过蜜月套房
Never had the bridal suite.

289
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,740
员工都住在四个街区外的
The staff always stayed in the Best Western

290
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,780
贝斯特韦斯特酒店
four blocks away.

291
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,720
好好享用你的香槟吧
Enjoy your champagne.

292
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,250
只是约你喝杯酒  绝没别的意思
I wasn't suggesting anything more than a drink.

293
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,550
是吗
Weren't you?

294
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,270
纯属礼貌之举
Purely being polite.

295
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,730
晚安  雷米
Good night, Remy.

296
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,460
蜜月套房在最顶层
The bridal suite's on the top floor

297
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,900
走廊的尽头
at the end of the hallway,

298
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,210
随时欢迎你
if you change your mind.

299
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,320
晚安  克莱尔
Good night, Claire.

300
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,100
山上有个姑娘*
*I know a girl upon a hill

301
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,390
穿着粉红衣裳*
*I know a girl all dressed in pink

302
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,570
-*她害得我*  -*满手味儿*
*- She made my... * *- Fingers stink

303
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,280
奏起军乐*
*Sound off, oo-wah

304
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,090
大声唱*
*Make it loud

305
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,210
三  四  到了
3, 4! Yeah!

306
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,910
过来吧
Here you go.

307
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,990
肯尼  我看你胖了一圈  钻不过来了
Hey, Kenny, I think you got a little too big for this.

308
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,630
是洞变小了
I think the hole got a lot smaller.

309
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,700
别让腰围阻挡你的脚步
Don't let a little girth stop you.

310
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,570
到了  快看  快看
Here it is. Look, look, look.

311
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,020
好家伙  你找到了
Oh, oh, you found it, killer.

312
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,750
快看
Oh, wow, look at that.

313
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,650
81届步枪兵  菲尔・兰登  弗兰克・安德伍德  蒂姆・科贝特肯・卡斯维尔

314
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,550
噢  仙纳度*
*Oh, Shenandoah

315
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,840
我多想听到你声音*
*I long to hear you

316
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,740
波涛翻滚  流向远方*
*Far away you rolling river

317
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,750
噢  仙纳度*
*Oh, Shenandoah

318
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,200
只求靠近你*
*Just to be near you

319
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,730
绵延向前*
*Far away

320
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,590
汹涌远去*
*Around the way

321
00:16:50,590 --> 00:17:00,160
跨越广阔的密苏里*
*Cross the wide Missouri

322
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,930
很好  你呢
Good, and you?

323
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,100
其实我在查尔斯顿
Oh, I'm in Charleston, actually.

324
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,440
你怎么在这儿
What are you doing here?

325
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,660
我想给你个惊喜
I thought I'd surprise you.

326
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,200
惊喜吧
Surprise.

327
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,200
来  带你看看我青春期住的房间
Come on. Let me show you where I went through puberty.

328
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,750
我完全想象得出你16岁的样子
I can totally see you here at 16.

329
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,770
在这床上惹了不少麻烦吧
Got in some trouble on this bed, huh?

330
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,480
吵醒了整个街区
Woke up the whole block.

331
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,320
跟保罗谈得怎么样了
Hey, how'd it go with Paul?

332
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,060
他让我滚蛋
He told me to fuck off.

333
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,170
我妈也用她独有的方式
Which is what my mother told me,

334
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,740
表达了同样的意思
in her own special way.

335
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,800
我能去见她吗
Am I going to meet her?

336
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,710
你不会想见她的
You don't want to meet her.

337
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,980
我就想顺道拜访一下
I just wanted to stop by,

338
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,160
打声招呼  见个面
say hey, see her face.

339
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,980
克里斯蒂娜  你能来真好
Christina, it was really sweet of you to come up here.

340
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,080
说真的  我完全确定
Seriously, I'm officially convinced

341
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,170
你是我交往过的最好的女朋友
you're the most amazing woman I've ever been with,

342
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,250
但这次我是真心想自己解决这事
but I meant it when I said I wanted to take this trip alone.

343
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,530
明天肯定会闹得很不愉快
This thing tomorrow isn't going to be pleasant.

344
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,600
所以我才来  来支持你
Which is why I came... to be here for you.

345
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,480
精神支持
Moral support.

346
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,260
我了解这些人
I know these people.

347
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,830
他们不会给我好脸色的
They're going to lay into me big time.

348
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,340
明天对竞选很关键
Tomorrow's an important day for the campaign.

349
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,030
别跟我争
Don't fight me on this.

350
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,030
好吧
Okay.

351
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,990
我是住酒店呢
So do I get a hotel?

352
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,100
还是留在这儿
Do I stay here?

353
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,740
拜托  别这样嘛
Come on. Don't be like that.

354
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,510
酒店要舒服点
A hotel would be more comfortable.

355
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,810
不能浪费宝贵的竞选经费啊
But it would be a waste of valuable campaign funds.

356
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,440
竞选经费
Oh, campaign funds.

357
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,730
看到天花板上那条裂缝了吗
You see that crack up in the ceiling?

358
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,940
我以前每晚都盯着它入睡
I used to fall asleep staring at it every night.

359
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,860
每一寸  每个转折我都熟悉
I know every inch and curve.

360
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,690
这儿好黑  我好怕啊
It's dark in here. I'm scared.

361
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
小心点  兄弟
Be fucking careful, man!

362
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,320
亮起来
Let there be light!

363
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,660
你在想什么
What were you thinking about?

364
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,270
你和弗兰克为什么不要小孩
How come you and Frank have never had kids?

365
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,530
你也没有小孩
You've never had kids.

366
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,160
没错  但我没结婚
Yeah, but I'm not married.

367
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,520
回答我
Answer the question.

368
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,800
我们就是不想要
We just decided not to.

369
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,840
不是什么大事
There wasn't some big conversation.

370
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,450
你在说谎
I think you're lying.

371
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,650
随你怎么想
Think whatever you want.

372
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,920
你真的没考虑过
You've honestly never thought about it?

373
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,230
也许想过一两次吧
I mean, yeah, maybe, once or twice.

374
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,200
我并不觉得少了什么
I mean, I don't feel there's some void.

375
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,680
没有孩子我也很开心
I'm perfectly happy without.

376
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,980
你呢
What about you?

377
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,920
你能想象我为婴儿擦屁股  换尿布吗
Can you imagine me wiping a baby's ass and changing nappies?

378
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,080
不能
No, I can't.

379
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,410
其实  我刚刚想了
Actually, yes, I just did.

380
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,990
我要挂电话了
I'm gonna have to get off the phone.

381
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,020
你破坏了气氛
You've ruined everything.

382
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,920
我们确实该挂了
Well, we really should get off.

383
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,900
都一个多小时了吧
It's been... over an hour, I think.

384
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,170
好
Okay.

385
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,100
-你挂吧  -我马上就挂
- Go on then. - I'm hanging up right now.

386
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,580
不  我先挂
No, I am.

387
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,450
加油  别放弃
Come on. Don't quit on me.

388
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,330
我忘记做了几个了
Oh, I lost count.

389
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,760
别  别放弃
Don't be... don't quit.

390
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,550
天啊
Oh... oh, God!

391
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,410
你赢了
Oh, you win.

392
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,280
但这不是公平竞争
Oh, but it's not a fair fight.

393
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,930
你开了家漂流公司
You run a rafting company.

394
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,740
而我整天坐在办公室里
I sit behind a desk all day.

395
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,790
我倒想看看你拿着划桨
Oh, I'd love to see your ass with a paddle,

396
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,560
在四级急流里上蹿下跳
bouncing through a class-four rapid.

397
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,460
我能让国会俯首称臣
If I can whip congress into submission,

398
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,270
就不怕那点浪花
I'm not afraid of a little white water.

399
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,930
你无法驯服急流  弗兰克
You can't tame a rapid, Frank.

400
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,400
我心脏跳得好快
My heart is beating so fast...

401
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,940
如果我心脏病发  就是你的错
If I have a heart attack, it's your fault.

402
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,200
我也跳很快
Mine too.

403
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,070
来
Here.

404
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,690
我得再喝一杯
I need another drink.

405
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,780
我也是
I think I'll have another too.

406
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,420
别一人独享
Don't bogart that.

407
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,070
你觉得是这里造就了我们吗
Do you think this place made us?

408
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,980
什么意思
How do you mean?

409
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,410
我今天在校园里走
When I walked on campus today,

410
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,220
不禁在想  这地方有意义吗
I wondered, "Did it mean anything?

411
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,270
只是我们度过四年时光的地方
"If it's just a place we spent four years of our lives...

412
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,910
还是有别的意义
or was there more?"

413
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,990
我不知道
I don't know.

414
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,490
但我一直知道  终有一天
I do know you were always the guy

415
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,060
会有栋楼以你的名字命名
that was gonna get a building named after him.

416
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,380
我们都是小屁孩
I knew that the moment I saw you

417
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,600
你却能骂走教官  那时我就知道
cuss out the drill sergeant when we were knobs.

418
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,410
图书馆是个幌子
The library is a sham.

419
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,380
希金斯要我帮个忙
Higgins asked me a favor.

420
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,260
我让别人帮个忙
I asked someone else a favor.

421
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,300
他们就把我名字放了上去
They slapped my name on it.

422
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,030
和其他事一样  只是政治
Politics. Like everything else.

423
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,350
不是所有人都会被请去帮忙
Not everybody gets asked those favors.

424
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,270
也不是所有人都帮得上
Or knows how to deliver on 'em.

425
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,720
五十年后  那里也会被别的建筑取代
Oh, in 50 years they'll just replace it with something else.

426
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,710
就像这里被我的楼取代
Just like they're doing with this for mine.

427
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,550
你还是造过栋楼  不论它能维持多久
You still built something. However long it lasts.

428
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,750
图书馆没什么要紧
The library doesn't matter.

429
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,210
但我希望这里有些意义
But I want to think this place did.

430
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,080
它对那时的我们意义重大
I think it meant a lot to us. Then.

431
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,470
那我们呢
And what about us?

432
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,510
说实话  我没想过那么多
Honestly, I haven't really thought about it that much.

433
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,250
很久以前的事了
It's a long time ago.

434
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,170
我们以前那么好
We were so close.

435
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,650
像兄弟
Like brothers.

436
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,180
不止兄弟
More than brothers.

437
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,870
我们当时还小  弗兰克
We were kids, Frank.

438
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,270
闯过几次祸
We messed around a couple of times.

439
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,380
我被你深深吸引
I was so drawn to you.

440
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,200
我总能让你开怀大笑
I could always make you laugh.

441
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,500
我们怎么断了联络呢
How did we lose touch?

442
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,650
你上了法学院  我去当兵了
You went to law school. I joined the army.

443
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,350
你竞选议员  我搬去了科罗拉多
You ran for congress, I... I moved to Colorado.

444
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,820
三十年过去了
30 years goes by.

445
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,840
我的孩子都比那时的我们大了
I got children older than we were back then.

446
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,730
你有孩子吗  弗兰克
Do you have anyone, Frank?

447
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,340
我有克莱尔
I have Claire.

448
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,310
除了克莱尔呢
Besides Claire.

449
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,660
时不时会有
I have. From time to time.

450
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,140
我想要谁就是谁
If I want someone, I want them.

451
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,720
魅力使然
It's attraction.

452

在水上漂流时
When you're on the water,

00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,400
你能想的只有眼前的事

我认为两年是比较实际的估计

你认为  你有信心

518
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,300
你不能百分百保证
you can't predict 100%.

519
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,850
对我们有什么用
How does any of that help us?

我们会开展带薪培训项目

我承认  比在造船厂赚的少

527
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,910
-那是多少  -每小时6美元

528
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,540
那都达不到最低工资标准
That's not even minimum wage.

529
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,540
你要把它看做一笔投资

530

培训计划是很有价值的资源

我无力做投资

6美元一小时我全家都要睡马路了

你想让我怎么样  做五份兼职吗

如果你找一份兼职  再加上培训计划

536
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,380
你知道我是怎么想的吗
Do you wanna know what I think?

537

我觉得你整天在华盛顿无所事事
I think you sit around in Washington

538
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,110
想出一些在文件中看上去很好的
coming up with all sorts of fancy numbers and solutions

539
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,000
数据和解决方案
that look good on paper.

540
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,680
对我们来说却根本不适用
But that doesn't cut it for the rest of us.

541
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,180
你说你会照顾我们  你这个骗子
You said you had our backs, you lying piece of shit!

542
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,760
那些文件不能填饱肚子
We don't eat paper for dinner.

543
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,250
也不能用来遮风避雨
You can't put a paper roof over your head.

544
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,990
我们为你投票的时候
When we all voted for you,

545
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,690
我们都没有想到自己是在
I didn't think that every one of those votes

546
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,900
自掘坟墓
was another nail in our own coffin.

547
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,570
大家稍坐十分钟
Everybody just sit down for ten minutes.

548

551
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,000
就好像他们根本不想要解决方案
It's like they don't want to find a solution.

552
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,090
他们害怕了
They're scared.

553
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,670
我知道他们害怕了
I understand that they're scared,

554
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,450
但也不代表他们不能听取建议
but that doesn't mean they can't listen.

555
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,140
你不了解这些人  克里斯蒂娜
You don't know these people, Christina.

556
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,240
我在你的办公室工作了三年

我和他们谈过话  我接过他们的电话

可你没跟他们一起长大
You didn't grow up with them.

560
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,740
我不需要和他们一起长大
I don't need to grow up hand to mouth

561
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,770
来同情现状...
to empathize with the fact that...

562
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,780
他们不需要同情
they're not interested in empathy.

563
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,850
房子钥匙在我外套里
The house keys are in my jacket.

564
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,290
我回头打给你
I'll call you.

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,360
-彼得  -我说了我回头打给你
- Peter. - I said I'll call you.

胡扯
Nah, baloney.

604
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,570
我可以假装忙活一阵
I could have pretended to do more.

605
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,450
但我不相信活在过去
But I don't believe about living in the past.

606
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,760
我只在乎未来
I only care about the future.

607
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,930
还有一个你们很难接受的事实
Here's another truth that's gonna be hard to swallow.

608
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,110
你们只有我了
I'm all you've got.

609
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,480
华盛顿没有人在乎你们
Nobody in Washington gives a fuck about you.

610
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,770
没有人
No one.

611
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,360
他说的没错
He's right.

612
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
不管你们怎么看彼得
Whatever you think of Petey,

613
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,880
我们就只有他给的这一条路
we either go with him or we got nothin'.

614
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,980
我的提议
Now, does what I'm offering you

615
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,020
的确距你们想要的  应得的差得很远
come anywhere near what you want or deserve? No.

616
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,110
但你们要打开眼界  着眼当前
But you gotta open your eyes and take what's in front of you.

617
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,380
这是一个基础
We can build on that.

618
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,230
五千个工作岗位变成一万个
5,000 jobs becomes 10,000.

619
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,090
然后变成一万五千个  的确要等一段时间
Then 15,000. Not in the snap of a finger,

620
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,650
但绝对比停滞不前快
but faster than doing nothing will.

621
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,570
我能指望你们大伙吗
Can I count on all of you?

622
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,180
好的  我就当你们默许了
All right, I'll take that as a yes.

623
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,700
请留下你们的联系方式
We'll need your contact information

624
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,330
好给你们寄去材料和你们的朋友分享
so we can send you materials to share with your friends.

625
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,400
现在来说一下
Now, let's talk about the way

626
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,680

627
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,560
钱分六步到位  第一步
It's gonna happen in six stages. Stage one...

628
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:00,550
你看那星条旗*
*Oh say does that star-spangled

629
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:05,100
是否还依旧飘扬*
*Banner yet wave

630
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,890
在这自由的国度*
*For the land of the free

631
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:19,870
勇士的家乡*
*And the home of the brave

632
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,440
向左转  齐步走
Left face. Forward march.

648
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,680
没有什么是永恒的  即使是我身后的建筑
Nothing is permanent. Not even this building.

649
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,310
我不是不领情

我有幸和几位好朋友一起度过了

654

00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,050
很长时间没有见面的好朋友

我
I...

664
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,360
我真不知怎么说...
I wish I could describe...

665
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:04,290
和谐  这就是一直萦绕在我脑海的词
Harmony. That's the word that stuck in my mind.

666
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,670
和谐
Harmony.

667
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,260
与持久或永恒无关
It's not about what's lasting or permanent.

668
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:17,160
而是不同的声音  汇集在一起
It is about individual voices coming together.

669
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,590
只有那一瞬
For a moment.

670

那个瞬间
And that moment lasts...

671
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,260
只有一息之长

672

这就是我对自己在这里的那段时光的看法
That's what I think about my time here.

673
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,280
请你们原谅我
You'll have to forgive me.

674
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,390
我昨晚多喝了几杯威士忌
I had more than a few whiskeys last night.

675
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,300
我还是个学员的时候  我们可以通宵畅饮
You know, when I was a cadet, we could drink all night

676
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,670
早上起来还能行军20英里
and then get up in the morning and march 20 Miles,

677
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,440
但现在我能上这三步台阶都算幸运
