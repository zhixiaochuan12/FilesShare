1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,910
弗兰克  我们会面的目的
The whole reason we do these meetings, Frank,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,850
就是为从你那儿得到准确的信息
is so I can get accurate information from you.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,090
我始终说票数会很胶着
I always said it was going to be close.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,100
那为什么昨天我读到的报道
Then why did every article I read yesterday

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,550
都说领导集团相信法案会通过
say the leadership was confident the bill would pass?

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,140
您知道简宁・斯克斯基吗
Do you know Janine Skorsky?

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,110
她曾任《先驱报》驻白宫记者
She used to be the Herald's White House correspondent.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,170
我记得简宁
I remember Janine.

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,200
她为头条网写了篇文章
She wrote an article for Slugline

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,030
报道了一份经核实的计票结果
reporting a verified vote count.

11
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,210
一旦被媒体拿到  那东西就满天飞了
Once the media got ahold of that, it went everywhere.

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,530
我不知道她哪弄到的数字  
I don't know where she got that number.

13
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,410
或许是她编造的
Maybe she made it up.

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,810
是不是她编的不重要
It doesn't matter if she made it up.

15
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,230
外界认为民主党出现了分歧  
The democrats seem divided.

16
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,550
领导集团就显得很无能
The leadership looks incompetent.

17
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,240
与财政预算和我们的教育法案相比
But compared to the the budget and our education act,

18
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,870
这不过是个小法案  先生
well, this was a minor bill, sir.

19
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,940
可它恰恰却受全国瞩目
That happened to be in the national spotlight,

20
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,270
这是你想要的
which is what you wanted.

21
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,060
计票我算错了
I got the count wrong.

22
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,710
这很罕见  但确实发生了
It rarely happens, but it happens.

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,030
令我担心的是  白宫方面的影响
What worries me is that the White House's influence

24
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,950
没能在国会给你支持
isn't translating into support on the hill.

25
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,000
琳达的参与没起到丝毫作用
Linda's involvement had no effect?

26
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,800
并不是这么回事  先生
I wouldn't say that that's the case, sir.

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,650
教育法案之争有没有带来
Did you sense any push-back, any fallout

28
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,640
什么阻力和影响
from the education battle?

29
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,220
先生  事实是我并未出席 
Sir, the truth is I wasn't there.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,610
我当时必须得去趟加州
I had to make a trip to California

31
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,670
为我儿子去见斯坦福的教务长
to meet the Provost of Stanford for my son.

32
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,190
我上周跟您提过
I told you about it last week.

33
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,640
这是我的主意  先生
It was my decision, sir.

34
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,710
我当时认定
I made a judgment call

35
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,540
没有她的帮助法案也能通过
that we could pass the bill without her help.

36
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,620
但事实是  这种差距甚微的投票
But, look, tight votes like this,

37
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,310
分析不出个所以然来
you can analyze them to death,

38
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,900
最终结果就是我们票数落后
but at the end of the day, we came up short.

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,590
这只归咎于我个人  绝非琳达的错
That's my fault, no one else's. Certainly not Linda's.

40
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,280
我当时就不该离开
I shouldn't have gone.

41
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,160
那场会面毫无成果
The meeting didn't even work.

42
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,070
你不是说他们会重新考虑
I thought you said they were reconsidering.

43
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,700
不  我今早收到一封邮件
No. I got an e-mail this morning.

44
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,450
他们决定不推翻招生办的决定
They decided not to overturn the admissions decision.

45
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,790
天呐  真是遗憾  琳达
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.

46
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,050
今天不怎么顺利
Not a great day so far.

47
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,380
不过还是要谢谢你刚才为我打圆场
But I appreciate your covering for me in there.

48
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,200
或许琳达的噩运能变成我的机遇
There may be a way to turn Linda's bad luck into my good fortune.

49
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,370
不过首先我要解决组织内的背叛
But first I must deal with treason within the ranks...

50
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,930
那两个投反对票的叛徒
the two renegades who voted against the bill.

51
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,280
我绝不容忍背叛行为
I have zero tolerance for betrayal,

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,660
很快  他们就会永远记住这点
which they will soon indelibly learn.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,180
我知道投票失利的原因
I know why you lost the vote.

54
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,120
有人去找了范德博格和艾布拉姆斯
Somebody got to Vanderburgh and Abrams.

55
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,000
雷米・丹顿
Remy Danton.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,450
你妻子
Your wife.

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,830
我在他们两边都有联络人
I've got contacts on both their staffs.

58
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,810
他们三人见过一面
There was a meeting between the three of them.

59
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,090
我知道  我安排的
I know. I arranged it.

60
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,430
-她让他们投反对票  -不是这样
- She told them to vote no. - No, not true.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,140
那两边的人怎么说法完全一致
Sources on two different staffs saying the exact same thing?

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,820
这完全没道理
That makes no sense.

63
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,480
我不是在跟你讲道理
I'm not telling you what makes sense,

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,930
我是在陈述事实
I'm telling you facts.

65
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,090
这可是个猛料  弗兰西斯
This is a juicy story, Francis.

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,040
卡莉绝对会喜欢
Carly will love it.

67
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,990
多数党党鞭的妻子在背后捅他刀子
The majority whip's wife stabs him in the back.

68
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,060
当心点  佐伊
Be careful, Zoe.

69
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,400
我在给你提供信息  
I'm feeding you.

70
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,420
现在你该给我提供信息了
Now you have to feed me.

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,890
给我点更好的新闻
So give me something better.

72
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,770
回答我的问题
Are you going to answer my question?

73
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,610
她有没有那么做
Did she or didn't she?

74
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,980
快说  否则上帝保佑
Tell me now, or so help me God,

75
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,750
我会倾尽一生
I will make it my mission in life

76
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,540
毁掉你们的职业生涯
to not only destroy your careers,

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,020
碾碎你们努力博得的一切幸福与希望
but to obliterate all hope and happiness that you manage to cling to.

78
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,650
-她说我们可以  -在背后捅我刀子吗
- She said it would be okay... - To backstab me?

79
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,500
做我们认为对的事
To do what we thought was right.

80
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,630
那她的确让你们投反对票了
So she did tell you to vote no.

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,350
她说即使法案不通过也不是世界末日
She said it wouldn't be the end of the world if the bill failed.

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,450
这是她的原话
Those were her exact words.

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,740
这件事不许跟任何人说  明白了吗
You discuss this with no one. Is that understood?

84
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,170
没待在华盛顿为法案拉票你感到自责吗
Do you blame yourself for not being in Washington to secure the votes?

85
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,600
这么大的法案要靠团队合作
A bill this size is a team effort.

86
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,370
还有其他联署人呢
There are a lot of sponsors.

87
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,260
但你是主发起者  法案的负责人
But you were the chief sponsor and the bill manager.

88
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,970
话是不错
That's true.

89
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,450
那你不是该留在华盛顿吗
So shouldn't you have been in Washington?

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,930
我在竞选州长
I'm running for Governor.

91
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,700
我要履行对宾州人民的职责
I have a commitment to the people of my state.

92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,670
你是否知道斯沃夫阵营
Are you aware that the Swofford campaign

93
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,720
今天放出新的宣传语
is putting out a new commercial today that says,

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,250
"如果彼得・罗素在国会都撑不下去
quote, "If Peter Russo can't follow through in congress,

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,930
他还能抵住酒精的诱惑吗"
can he follow through with sobriety?"

96
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,130
访问到此结束  非常感谢各位
That's all. Thank you very much.

97
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,630
-你不作出回应吗  -谢谢各位
- Do you want to comment? - Thanks, guys.

98
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,500
议员先生
Congressman!

99
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,170
我不过是说了你常说的  凭良心投票
All I said was what you always say... to vote their conscience.

100
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,000
你鼓动他们违抗我
You encouraged them to defy me.

101
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,930
我见过他们了  你要我...
I met with them. That's what you asked me...

102
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,210
不  你不是只见面了
No, that is not what you did.

103
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,750
我明确说了需要他们投赞成票
I specifically told you I needed them to vote yes on this bill.

104
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,470
根本毫无歧义
There was no room for interpretation.

105
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,280
你存心撒谎  不要再粉饰了  克莱尔
It's a deliberate lie, so don't try to sugarcoat it, Claire.

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,800
我需要雷米的帮助  你又不帮我
I needed Remy's help. You wouldn't offer any.

107
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,380
等下
Oh, wait.

108
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,850
你是为雷米这么做的
You did this for Remy?

109
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,610
不是  为我自己  我要把货从苏丹运出来
No. For myself. To get my shipment out of Sudan.

110
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,050
他施以了援手
He provided assistance.

111
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,500
以否决法案作为代价
In exchange for defeating the bill.

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,860
不  只是没有促成法案通过
No. In exchange for not helping it succeed.

113
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,870
不就是一回事吗
Which is the same goddamn thing.

114
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,370
你知不知道你危及了
Do you realize you have endangered

115
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,110
我们一直以来苦心经营的一切
everything that we have been working toward?

116
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,900
一切都安排好了啊  克莱尔
There was a timetable here, Claire.

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,720
直到最后一刻我们都得保持这股劲头
We needed strong momentum right up until the last minute.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,690
你遇事不和我商量  我怎么依计划行事
I can't operate based on plans you haven't shared with me.

119
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,090
那你也该先问我一下
Then you should've asked me first.

120
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,810
不  我不会每次做决定
No, I'm not going to ask for your blessing

121
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,400
都征求你的意见  弗兰西斯
on every decision I make, Francis.

122
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,650
我们是一起做决定
We make decisions together.

123
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,680
我怎么没觉得
Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that.

124
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,340
至少过去六个月不是这样
Not for the past six months.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,010
我没觉得我们是在并肩作战
I don't feel as though I'm standing beside you.

126
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,080
有人知道这事  克莱尔
Other people know, Claire.

127
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,250
这可能成为我们的把柄
This could become a story about us.

128
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,210
而且是一竿子就能把人打死的事
And that's something you do not recover from.

129
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,000
-谁知道  -这种事永远洗刷不掉
- Who? - That's something that follows you for life.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,090
谁知道
Who knows?

131
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,350
佐伊
Zoe.

132
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,650
你不是说她可以信任吗
I thought you said she could be trusted.

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,900
那我们之间的信任呢
What about our trust?

134
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,540
你无法控制她  是吧  弗兰西斯
You can't control her, can you, Francis?

135
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,100
你如果没撒谎  她就不是问题
She wouldn't have been a problem if you hadn't lied.

136
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
不  如果你没跟她上床
No, she wouldn't have been a problem

137
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,440
她才不是问题
if you hadn't dropped your pants.

138
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,750
你来我办公室  痛斥我一顿
And you come in here, to my office, and berate me

139
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,800
而实际上这都是你的错
when you're the one who's exposed us?

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,580
你休想把矛头指向我
Don't you try to turn this around on me.

141
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,460
我为你解雇了一半的员工
I fired half of my staff for us.

142
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,610
回绝了送上门的捐款
I have turned down donations for us.

143
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,000
起草了彼得的法案
I drafted Peter's bill for us.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,470
搁置我自己的理想  去忙你的事
I diverted time and energy away from my goals for us.

145
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,160
好吧  我本不想这么说的
Okay, I don't wanna have to say this,

146
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,090
但你或许该听听
but maybe you need to hear it.

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,600
净水计划是重要
C.W.I. is important, yes,

148
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,060
但它根本比不上我们努力奋斗的目标
but it doesn't come close to what we are trying to accomplish.

149
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,370
你要认清这一点
You must see that!

150
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,670
我只是实事求是
I'm just being honest.

151
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,110
那就老实承认你利用了我
Then be honest about how you've been using me

152
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,010
就像你利用其他人
just like you use everybody else.

153
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,820
可从没说过会是这样
That was never part of the bargain.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,610
是因为潮热[更年期症状]吗
Is it the hot flashes?

155
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,930
滚出去
Get out.

156
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,630
给我滚
Get out.

157
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,500
回家再见
I'll see you back at the house.

158
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,950
我在去办公室的路上
I'm on my way to the office.

159
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,040
到那儿给你电话
Let me call you when I get there.

160
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,300
不  现在就谈
No, no. We need to talk now.

161
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,420
我知道你很生气  彼得
I know you're upset, Peter,

162
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,630
但那也没有用
but that's not going to achieve anything.

163
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,110
我不止生气  弗兰克
I am more than upset, Frank.

164
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,900
注意你的语气  我没心情
Change your tone. I'm in no mood.

165
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,020
-我不在乎  -再见  彼得
- I don't give a fuck! - Good-bye, Peter.

166
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,960
你挂我电话  就别怪我接下来去找谁
You hang up on me now, you're not gonna appreciate who I call next.

167
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,860
-你说什么  -我承诺给我的人民工作
- Excuse me? - I promised my people jobs.

168
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,430
你承诺会让这份法案通过
You promised me you could get this bill passed.

169
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,150
你食言了  但我不会
You failed on your promise. I'm not gonna fail on mine.

170
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,510
无论你想什么办法  把这问题解决掉
So however you need to fix it, you figure it out.

171
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,620
否则  我就把科佩尼科和科恩社论的事抖出来
Otherwise, I go public with Kapeniak and the Kern editorial.

172
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,080
你需要冷静
You need to cool down

173
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,610
仔细地考虑下刚才说的话
and think very carefully about what you just said.

174
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,570
你不明白  我不再怕你了  弗兰克
You don't understand. I'm not afraid of you anymore, Frank.

175
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,910
那你就大错特错了
Then you're misguided.

176
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,260
我的过去已经公开了
My past is out in the open.

177
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,460
你再也不能以此威胁我了
You don't hold that over my head anymore.

178
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,920
他们不知道所有事  彼得
They don't know everything, Peter.

179
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,580
你毁了我  就是毁你自己
You destroy me, you destroy yourself.

180
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,090
快解决
Fix it.

181
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,200
-你要我怎么做  -加快进度
- What do you want me to do? - We have to accelerate things.

182
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,450
是不是早了点
Isn't it too early?

183
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,760
离选举还有近两个月
It's almost two full months into the election.

184
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,230
这样白宫的审查能做得很充分
That gives the White House too much time to vet somebody.

185
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,380
彼得越界了
Peter's crossed the line.

186
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,910
我们为他建立自信  现在控制不住他了
We built up his confidence, and now we're losing control of him.

187
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,690
也许他只是在发脾气
Maybe he was just blowing off steam.

188
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,580
不  他主意已定  我们得马上行动
No. He's determined. We have to act now.

189
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,660
你那边准备妥当了吗
You have everything you need on your end?

190
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,840
给我时间地点就行
Give me a when and a where.

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,170
最好是社交场合
Some sort of social setting's preferable.

192
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,090
-还有吗  -我需要现金
- Anything else? - I'll need cash.

193
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,270
大概三千
About three grand.

194
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,450
明早放在你上层抽屉里
It'll be in your top drawer by tomorrow morning.

195
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,400
先生
Sir...

196
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,840
一旦这么做  就不能回头了
Once we do this, we're committed.

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,920
-我知道  -我无法预测他的反应
- Understood. - I can't predict how he's gonna react.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,510
我不能忍受勒索
Well, I won't be blackmailed.

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,670
谁
Hello?

200
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,980
佐伊・巴恩斯
Zoe Barnes?

201
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,040
是的  你是谁
Yeah. Who is it?

202
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,730
克莱尔・安德伍德
Claire Underwood.

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,390
佐伊
Zoe?

204
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,710
很抱歉我没有按门铃
I apologize for not buzzing.

205
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,080
我在楼下时  正好有人进楼
Somebody was coming in the building when I was downstairs,

206
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,220
所以我就...
so I just figured...

207
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,670
有防火梯  不错啊
This is nice... fire escape.

208
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,660
你能别乱碰我的东西吗
Hey, could you please not go through my things?

209
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,340
对不起  我打扰到你了吗
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I intruding?

210
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,710
是啊
Yeah, actually. You are.

211
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,270
那我们真是彼此彼此了
Well, that makes it a two-way street, I suppose.

212
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,620
如果你是来惩罚我的
Okay, if you... if you came here to punish me...

213
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,680
好吧  我懂的
Fine. I get it.

214
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,900
真可惜
Such a shame,

215
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,970
你太天真了
how naive you are.

216
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,120
-我不天真  -是吗
- I'm not naive. - No?

217
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,260
我从一开始就知道一切  佐伊
I've known everything from the beginning, Zoe.

218
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,550
我和我丈夫之间无话不谈
My husband and I tell each other everything.

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,520
你不信我吗
Don't you believe me?

220
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,830
这里有蜘蛛让我抓吗
Is there a spider I can trap?

221
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,790
我不是来惩罚你  或是叫你停手
I'm not here to punish you or to tell you to stop.

222
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,670
我只是想让你睁大眼睛看清事实
I just thought I should open those big bright eyes.

223
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,520
我想你该走了
I think you should leave.

224
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,260
我想也是
I think I should too.

225
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,550
也许你没那么天真
Maybe you're not that naive.

226
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,660
换个小丫头连门都不敢开
A lesser woman wouldn't have opened the door.

227
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,230
到联合车站
Union Station, please.

228
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,660
我是克莱尔  现在不能接听你的电话
This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer the phone,

229
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,670
如果你留了言
but if you leave a message,

230
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,490
我会尽快回复你
I'll be sure and get back to you shortly.

231
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,270
谢谢
Thank...

232
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,880
-喂  -佐伊
- Hello? - Zoe.

233
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,630
你不用轻手轻脚的
You don't have to tiptoe.

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,050
我以为你睡着了
I thought you fell asleep.

235
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,220
没有  在想工作的事
No. Just thinking about work.

236
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,460
我现在还没有料给你  很快就有了
I don't have anything for you yet. I will soon.

237
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,010
我知道
I know you will.

238
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,340
你愿意的话  可以在这里过夜
You can spend the night if you want.

239
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,010
还要早起开会
Early meetings.

240
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,580
那样就没时间回家换衣服了
Wouldn't have time to get home and change.

241
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,110
-你好像心神不宁  -烦心事太多
- You seem distracted. - I have a lot on my mind.

242
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,000
比如
Like what?

243
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,490
-工作的事  和你一样  -克莱尔呢
- Work, just like you. - No Claire?

244
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,460
或者她也算工作
Or maybe she qualifies as work.

245
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
她什么都没提吗
She didn't mention anything?

246
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,630
提什么
About...

247
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,670
你们不是无话不谈吗
I thought you didn't keep things from each other.

248
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,340
想说什么就说
Look, just say what you want to say.

249
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,800
她几个小时前来过
She came by here a few hours ago.

250
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,070
我们聊了一会儿
We had a nice little talk.

251
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,000
你走吧
Don't let me keep you.

252
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,900
你该回家休息一下
You should go home, get some rest.

253
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,020
代我向克莱尔问好
Tell Claire I said hi.

254
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,550
我是克莱尔  现在不能...
This is Claire. I'm unavailable to answer...

255
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,650
沃顿家的灯待会儿就要亮了
The lights in the Whartons' house will go on in a few moments.

256
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,580
他们总是6点45准时起床
They always get up precisely at quarter to 7:00,

257
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,800
如果克莱尔在这儿
which is just the time that Claire would be going for her run,

258
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,400
她就会这时去跑步
if she were here.

259
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,690
谁都不听话
Rebellion on all fronts...

260
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,260
克莱尔  佐伊  罗素
Claire, Zoe, Russo.

261
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,670
我不能失去决心
I must not lose my resolve.

262
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,070
我会继续向前
I will march forward,

263
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,840
即便我必须
even if I have to do so...

264
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,400
独自前行
alone.

265
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,860
说中了吧
See? Told ya.

266
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,890
早上好
Good morning.

267
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,830
你好  弗兰克
Hi, Frank.

268
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,730
-你好吗  -很好
- How are you? - I'm good.

269
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,920
-收到克莱尔的消息了吗  -嗯  她的短信
- Have you heard from Claire? - Yeah, I got her message.

270
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,930
-她感觉怎么样  -好多了
- How's she feeling? - A lot better.

271
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,180
很好  她说她下周前都没法来
Good. She said she'd be gone for the rest of the week.

272
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,580
-是流感吗  -差不多
- Is it the flu or something? - Something like that.

273
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,250
我就过来到她办公室拿点东西
I just came over to pick up a few things from her office.

274
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,030
-我可以找人送去的  -不  没事的
- I could've sent somebody over. - Oh, no. It's no big deal.

275
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,440
其实  我还想来请你帮个忙
In fact, I also came here to ask you a favor.

276
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,160
你念的斯坦福  对吧
You went to Stanford, correct?

277
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,070
-还致了告别辞  -对
- Valedictorian? - Yeah.

278
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,610
-你认识教务长吗  -沃伦・泰斯戴尔
- Do you know the provost? - Warren Tynsdale.

279
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,590
他让我组织募捐活动
He flies me out to do fund-raising events.

280
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,050
可能我是校友的杰出代表吧
Supposedly I'm the poster child for alumni.

281
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,880
让世界更美好
Making the world a better place.

282
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,350
那很好  这事很重要
Well, that is good, because this is important.

283
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,810
琳达・瓦斯奎兹  总统的幕僚长
Linda Vasquez, the President's chief of staff...

284
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,420
她的儿子鲁本递了申请
her son, Ruben, applied.

285
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,550
我希望你能打电话给泰斯戴尔
I'd love for you to get on the phone with Tynsdale

286
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,580
告诉他学校应该录取他
and tell him that they should accept him.

287
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,890
这...我从没推荐过别人
I don't know. I... I've never recommended anyone.

288
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,090
这样更好  更有分量
All the better. It'll carry more weight.

289
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
我能先见见鲁本吗
Can I meet Ruben first?

290
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,310
我其实不想让琳达知道
I would really prefer that Linda not know.

291
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,210
其实  最好让他们母子
In fact, it would be better if both she and Ruben

292
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,570
都以为他是因为出色而被录取
believed he got in on merit alone.

293
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,560
能帮我和克莱尔这个忙吗
Will you please do this favor for Claire and me?

294
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,350
也算帮了总统
And for the President.

295
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,340
谢谢
Thank you.

296
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,570
增加对比度
More contrast.

297
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,950
我们要捕捉他的面部轮廓
We need to catch the edge of his face.

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,310
重新剪裁吧  左边加四分之一英寸
Let's re-crop it. Bring it in a quarter of an inch on the left.

299
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,020
能去...
Would you...

300
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,330
有个克莱尔找你
Somebody named Claire?

301
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
雷米
Remy.

302
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,810
饿吗
You hungry?

303
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,590
我不吃猪肉
I don't eat pork.

304
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,750
什么时候的事
When did that happen?

305
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,420
开始给肉类加工业游说时
When we started lobbying for the meatpacking industry.

306
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,640
弗莱迪  给我半块肋排
Freddy, half a rack for me,

307
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,080
再给我朋友来点羽衣甘蓝
and some Collard Greens for my friend here.

308
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,580
不用了  我吃过午饭了
I'm good. I already ate lunch.

309
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,180
半块肋排马上就好
Half a rack coming up.

310
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,510
我一般不在这儿谈公事
I don't usually do business here.

311
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,110
这里是我的小秘密
This is my little secret.

312
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,000
希望你别说出去
I'd love it if we could keep it that way.

313
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,690
你不用担心我会带客户过来
I don't think you have to worry about me bringing clients by.

314
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,130
你好像很紧张  雷米
You seem tense, Remy.

315
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,290
流域法案的事你很生气吧
I assume you're upset about the watershed bill.

316
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,320
我不怪你  你只是在做本职工作
Not with you. You were just doing your job.

317
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,990
但我也得做好我的工作
But now I have to do mine.

318
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
我想建立合作关系
I'd like to propose a partnership.

319
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,930
我一向愿意合作  弗兰克
I'm always open to partnerships, Frank.

320
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,700
如果彼得・罗素支持天然气开采
If Peter Russo were a pro-natural gas candidate,

321
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,730
对桑科有多大的价值
how valuable would that be to Sancorp?

322
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,470
但流域法案反对开采
The watershed bill was anti-drilling.

323
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,910
彼得是支持就业  不是反对开采
Peter's pro-employment, not anti-drilling.

324
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,190
他只是想为选民创造更多就业机会
He just wants to bring employment to his people,

325
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,920
而桑科刚好在建设精炼厂
and Sancorp is building refineries.

326
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,300
但大多数都建在当地
Mostly on site.

327
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,260
你认为桑科会考虑
Do you think they would be open

328
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,850
在费城建厂吗
to considering Philadelphia?

329
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,840
我可以和他们谈谈  但不能保证
I can talk with them, but I can't make any promises.

330
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,210
我不需要保证  你就先去和罗素谈谈
Oh, I don't want any promises. Just engage with Russo.

331
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,140
描绘一下美好前景之类的
You know, give him a glimmer of good fortune.

332
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,980
来了  弗兰克
Frank, here you go.

333
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,160
闻闻这香味
Come on. Smell that.

334
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,880
真不想改主意吗
You sure you don't want to reconsider your stance on pork?

335
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,770
健脑食品啊  兄弟
Brain food, brother.

336
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,940
-我喜欢这地方  -每月850美金
- I love it. - 850.

337
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,110
能付得起吗
You can afford that?

338
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,320
没问题
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

339
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,860
首末两月的租金已经付过了
First and last month are taken care of.

340
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,900
押金也付了
So is the security deposit.

341
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,730
用这笔钱买点家具吧
That's to buy some furniture.

342
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,560
我会还给你的  我保证
I'll pay you back. I promise.

343
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,050
不用了
It's not necessary.

344
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,170
不过我确实要请你帮个忙
But I do need you to do one thing for me.

345
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,430
-人们会觉得我是个伪君子  -你得增加就业
- I come across as a hypocrite. - You need jobs.

346
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,150
谁会在乎那些职位是怎么来的
Do you really care how you deliver them?

347
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,710
我先是主张加强对流域的管制
First, I advocate for more regulation for the watershed,

348
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,480
然后又去投奔开采业
then I cozy up to the drilling interests?

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,610
但天然气是大势所趋  彼得
Yeah, but natural gas is the future, Peter.

350
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,190
这一产业能在未来十年
This is an industry that could bring

351
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,290
给你家乡带来十万个工作岗位
100,000 jobs into your state over the next decade.

352
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,480
我和彼得想法一致  这样做有点出尔反尔
I agree with Peter. It seems like flip-flopping.

353
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,370
流域法案的流产要归咎于桑科的游说
Sancorp's lobbying efforts is why we lost the watershed bill.

354
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:40,530
但他们也会成为强大的盟友
But they can also be a very powerful ally.

355
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,930
我们的竞选口号是"崭新的开始"
Our message is a "Fresh start."

356
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,910
这么做会让人觉得你并没改变
This makes you look like business as usual.

357
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,260
这是政治
This is politics.

358
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,050
你可以抓住机会  也可能错过机会
There are seized opportunities and missed opportunities.

359
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,950
抓住这个机会  彼得
Seize this one, Peter.

360
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,180
桑科能保证在费城新建精炼厂吗
Sancorp can commit to building new refineries in Philly?

361
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,020
桑科能保证和你商讨此事
Sancorp will commit to discussing it with you.

362
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,600
-这可不够  -你让我解决问题
- I need more than that. - Look, you asked me to fix a problem.

363
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,340
我在24小时之内就给出了解决方案
I've come to you in less than 24 hours with a solution.

364
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,880
你能不能也做出让步呢
Can you meet me halfway?

365
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,410
第一步要怎么做
What would be the first step?

366
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,580
很好  还记得雷米・丹顿吗
All right. You remember Remy Danton?

367
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,080
得了吧  就是他牵头反对流域法案的
Oh, come on. He led the charge against the watershed bill.

368
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,560
我知道  但这不重要
I know. That's not the point.

369
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,540
麦克奈利癌症研究所也是他的大客户之一
One of his other big clients is the McNeally cancer institute.

370
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,520
他们今晚将举办一场宴会
They're having a big gala tonight...

371
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,530
鸡尾酒会  宴请捐款人
a cocktail party... for their donors.

372
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,660
雷米也会到场
Remy will be there.

373
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,370
我们在哈弗福德和格莱德文有活动...
We have events in Haverford and Gladwyne...

374
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,900
这件事更重要
Yeah, well, this is more important.

375
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,810
你明早还要跟匹兹堡当地的电台
You also have a radio interview tomorrow morning

376
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,350
做连线访谈  对吗
with a local Pittsburgh station?

377
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,700
-是的  -好吧
- Yes. - All right.

378
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,960
今晚和雷米谈谈
Meet with Remy tonight.

379
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,380
如果谈得顺利而且你也愿意
And if it goes well and if you're comfortable,

380
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,730
就在明早访谈的时候
tomorrow morning on the radio,

381
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,900
表示支持他们开采
you support their drilling efforts.

382
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,370
雷米已经向我保证  如果你这么做了
And Remy has assured me if you do that,

383
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,700
他会说服桑科跟我们合作
he can push Sancorp in the right direction.

384
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,370
取消明天的活动
Cancel the events tomorrow.

385
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,800
回费城去  尽力弥补损失
Head back to Philly, do some damage control.

386
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,730
-我明天下午就过去  -彼得
- I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. - Peter...

387
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,260
拜托
Please.

388
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,420
好吧
Okay.

389
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,750
我去打几个电话
I'm gonna go make some calls.

390
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,630
彼得  你跟她提过科佩尼科吗
Peter, have you mentioned anything to her about Kapeniak or...

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,860
没有  我没跟任何人说过
No. I haven't mentioned it to anybody.

392
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,330
好吧  明早斯坦普会过去
All right. Stamper will come by in the morning

393
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,110
向你说明要点
and brief you on the talking points.

394
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,960
这是什么时候拍的
When did you take this?

395
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,170
大概是早上七点
Oh, it was about 7:00 in the morning.

396
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,690
太阳刚出来
The sun had just come up.

397
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,990
你正在酣睡  就在这里
You were asleep... right here.

398
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,910
光线很完美
The light was perfect.

399
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,780
我情不自禁
I had no choice.

400
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,310
在这个公寓我一向睡得安稳
I always slept so well in this apartment.

401
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,820
这次要待多久
How long are you in town for?

402
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,760
我不知道
I don't know.

403
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,570
还没想好
I haven't decided.

404
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,810
你没带行李
You have no luggage.

405
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,940
这里的味道还是一样
It smells the same.

406
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,820
感觉也没变
Feels the same.

407
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,280
不在费城占有一席之地
I think Sancorp is missing out,

408
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,620
是桑科的损失
not having a significant presence in Philadelphia.

409
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,810
以大城市为中心是有好处
There are advantages to centralizing in a major urban center.

410
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,590
但也有缺点  商业地产的地价
But the disadvantages are commercial real estate prices,

411
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,120
缴城市税  铺设管道
city taxes, building a pipeline.

412
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,390
这些都耗资巨大
It's all very costly.

413
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,250
那就得从其他方面削减开支
So they'd have to reduce costs elsewhere.

414
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,580
-当然  -我能帮上什么忙
- Significantly. - How can I help with that?

415
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,660
开放全州土地
Statewide permitted-use zoning.

416
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,430
去除区划限制
No more conditional zoning.

417
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,330
地方政府阻碍了发展
The municipalities are slowing down development.

418
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,130
但这是宾州法律啊
That's the state legislature.

419
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,820
你要是支持开放土地
You come out in support of permitted use,

420
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,260
就能当选州长了
and you get elected Governor.

421
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,180
这能给立法机构造成压力
That'll put pressure on the legislature.

422
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,300
桑科很愿意在哈里斯堡[宾州首府]
Sancorp is very interested in having

423
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,790
结交一位有分量的朋友
a powerful friend in Harrisburg.

424
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
我的对手也支持开采
My opponent's pro-drilling.

425
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,370
但你的对手没说要在费城建精炼厂
Your opponent isn't asking for refineries in Philadelphia.

426
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,900
我们更喜欢靠得住的朋友
We prefer friends we can count on.

427
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,550
让你的客户明早7点45分收听WZPZ
Have your clients listen to WZPZ tomorrow at a quarter to 8:00.

428
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,050
是匹兹堡的电台
It's a Pittsburgh station.

429
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
聊得很愉快  议员先生
It's been a pleasure, Congressman.

430
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,520
希望能尽快再谈
I look forward to talking again soon.

431
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,780
有打火机吗
You got a light?

432
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,840
这可是癌症研究宴会
This is a cancer research event.

433
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,320
我知道  我也帮忙组织了啊
I know. I helped organize it.

434
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,020
-你在研究所工作  -不  是酒店
- You work for the institute? - No. The hotel.

435
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,630
他们让你在这儿抽烟
And they let you smoke here?

436
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,480
不  经理会杀了我的
No. The manager would kill me.

437
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,500
不过至少让你开口了
Well, at least it got you talking.

438
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,760
今晚很顺利吗  你看起来很高兴
Are you having a good night? You look happy.

439
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,210
是啊  很顺利
Uh, I am. I am. I'm having a great night.

440
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,340
-为什么  -刚刚收到了好消息
- Why? - I just got some very good news.

441
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,500
那得庆祝一下  你要喝什么
We should celebrate. What are you drinking?

442
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,950
其实我正打算走了
You know, I was just leaving, actually.

443
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,670
你还没问我叫什么呢
You haven't even asked my name yet.

444
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,730
-抱歉  但我得走了  -我叫瑞秋
- I apologize, but I have to go. - It's Rachel.

445
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,680
我不想失礼  但我明天还有个重要会议
I'm not trying to be rude, but I got a big meeting tomorrow.

446
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,510
那就别失礼  再待会儿
Then don't be rude. Just stay a few more minutes

447
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,290
这样我就不用找人攀谈了
and keep me from having to mingle.

448
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,820
我被男伴甩了  
My date ditched me.

449
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,620
你要是现在撇下我  那就很失礼了
So if you abandon me now, that would be very rude.

450
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,260
高跟鞋真要命
These heels are killing me.

451
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,920
摸摸看  这些水泡  
Feel that. Feel that blister.

452
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,430
我有女朋友了
Hey, I...I have a girlfriend.

453
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,070
要没有才奇怪呢
I'd be surprised if you didn't.

454
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,750
你的男伴为什么要甩了你  
Why'd your date ditch you?

455
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,320
说来很丢人
Mmm. Very scandalous.

456
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,750
怎么回事
What happened?

457
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,030
碰个杯
Clink glasses with me.

458
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,930
我虽然个子小  但很能喝
I'm petite, but I can hold my liquor.

459
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,210
看出来了
Obviously.

460
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,280
我一喝醉了就...
When I do get drunk, though...

461
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,080
就怎样
What then?

462
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
就脱衣服
I get undressed.

463
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,410
你呢
What about you?

464
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,260
你喝醉了会怎样
What are you like when you get drunk?

465
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,760
-不太好看  -好看不顶用 
- It's not pretty. - Pretty's overrated.

466
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,310
我反而喜欢不堪的场面
I like it when things get a little bit ugly.

467
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,500
我要是工作到很晚  
When I work late nights,

468
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,860
他们就让我住酒店
they let me stay at the hotel

469
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,490
我就不用开车回家了
so I don't have to drive home.

470
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,950
这张给你
This one is yours.

471
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,130
1121号房间
Room 1121.

472
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,080
先生
Sir?

473
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,210
在这儿
In here.

474
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,690
您找我吗
You wanted to see me?

475
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,440
我要你找一个人
I need you to locate somebody.

476
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,150
谁
Who?

477
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,990
我太太
My wife.

478
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,740
你有办法做到吗
Do you have a way of doing that?

479
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,320
有  先生
I do, sir.

480
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,040
我认识一个人  失踪人口部的...
I know a guy in missing persons...

481
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,180
她没有失踪  我只是
She's not missing. I just...

482
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:45,080
不知道她现在在哪里
don't know where she is at the moment.

483
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,380
我信任他
I trust him.

484
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,830
我们可以私下办
We can do this off the books.

485
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,750
很好
Good.

486
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,280
我这就去办
I'll get on it right away.

487
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,750
来嘛  再说个笑话
Come on. Give us another one.

488
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,950
不  我告诉你
No. I'll tell you why.

489
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,500
我妈妈以前总让我多笑笑
Because my mother always used to tell me to smile more.

490
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,670
总让我抓狂  她会说  "克莱尔
Always drove me crazy. She'd say, "Claire",

491
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,890
你怎么总是愁容满面
"Why have you that scowl all the time?

492
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,340
你笑起来的样子美多了"
You look so much more beautiful when you smile."

493
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,380
我们从来没真正聊过
It was never a real conversation.

494
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,180
她从来不会问我  "你感觉怎么样"
There was never, "Oh, what do you feel?"

495
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,500
或者"你在想什么"
Or "What are you thinking?"

496
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,520
只要我看上去漂亮幸福
Just so long as I looked beautiful and happy.

497
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,350
她只关心这个
That's all she cared about.

498
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,380
那你是希望我问你
So you want me to ask you

499
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,570
你在想什么  感觉怎么样
what you're thinking and feeling?

500
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,570
一直问
All the time.

501
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,480
其实我也挺好奇你的想法和感觉
I actually do wanna know what you're thinking and feeling.

502
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,630
-我真可悲啊  -是啊  不如你先说
- How sad am I? - Yes, so tell me first.

503
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,180
-什么  -你先告诉我
- What? - Tell me first.

504
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,660
-我还是去穿衣服吧  -什么  为什么
- I think I'd better get dressed. - What? Why?

505
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,590
因为...
Uh, because...

506
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,470
我约了朋友来
I've got friends coming over,

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,300
作为主人  总得穿件衣服
and as a host, I should probably wear clothes.

508
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,450
-真的吗  -对
- Really? - Yeah.

509
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,100
-那是为什么  -你懂的
- Why do you do that? - Well, you know.

510
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,730
-比较妥当  -差不多
- It's proper? - Kind of.

511
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,490
该死
Oh, fuck.

512
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,630
还以为你不来了呢
Thought you might have bailed.

513
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,950
坐吧
Sit down.

514
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,990
伏特加还是威士忌
Vodka or whiskey?

515
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,820
你喝吧
Uh, you go ahead.

516
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,280
拜托  你在楼下装乖就算了  在这儿不用啊
Come on. You can be a good boy downstairs, not up here.

517
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,330
真的  我不用
Seriously, I'm good.

518
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,600
威士忌吧
Whiskey, I think.

519
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,990
你的好消息是什么
So what's your good news?

520
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,400
我想知道我们在庆祝什么
I wanna know what we're celebrating.

521
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,740
你的男伴为什么甩了你
Why did your, uh... why did your date ditch you?

522
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,760
-我先问的  -我在楼下就问了
- I asked you first. - I did, downstairs.

523
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,620
他在国会工作
He works on the Hill.

524
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,820
工作人员之类的
Some staffer or something.

525
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,340
我也不清楚  可能就是个普通职员
I don't know. I think he's a glorified gofer.

526
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,280
一个朋友介绍的
A friend set me up with him.

527
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,770
我说他今晚可以过来陪我
So I said he should come tonight, keep me company.

528
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,050
但他只想和我闲扯
But all he wanted to do was schmooze.

529
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,280
我就带他去了女盥洗室
So I brought him into the women's bathroom,

530
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,160
跟他说他是个混蛋
told him he was being an asshole.

531
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,100
他反过来说我幼稚
He told me I was being childish.

532
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,240
我就扇了他一巴掌
So I slapped him.

533
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,700
你扇他耳光
You slapped him?

534
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,450
没错  脸上五道红指印
Yeah. Big red hand mark right across his face.

535
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,260
我想他怕被人看见丢脸
I think he was embarrassed to be seen by the Schmoozerati.

536
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,560
所以就走了
So he left.

537
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,970
这是我最后一次
And that is the last time

538
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,830
和戴国旗胸针上班的人约会了
I go on a date with a guy who wears a flag pin to work.

539
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,590
我也是其中之一
I'm one of those guys who wears a flag pin to work.

540
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,220
我们也不是在约会啊
This isn't really a date, is it?

541
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,270
我真的不该来这儿的
I really shouldn't be here.

542
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,950
这样才有趣
That's what makes it fun.

543
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,280
告诉我你的好消息  我们为什么干杯
Tell me your good news. I wanna know what we're toasting to.

544
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,110
我们为你干杯
Let's toast to you.

545
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,440
我就是你的好消息  好啊  干杯
I'm your good news? Okay, I'll toast to that.

546
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,500
你这是...

我不想在《先驱报》报社等
I didn't wanna wait at the Herald.

548
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,990
我本来想给你打电话  但是
I was gonna call you, but...

549
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,380
我今晚能住你家吗
Can I stay at your place tonight?

550
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,370

Uh, stay with me?

家里待不下去
I can't be in my apartment.

555
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,000

我早准备好了

598
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,620
除了我上回喝醉了跟踪你
Except for when I drunkenly stalked you at your...

599
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,390
-嗯  -挺可爱的
- Right. - That was kind of adorable.

600
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,060
应该说是发疯或是可悲
It was either psychotic or sad.

601
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,030
哪里可爱
Not adorable.

602
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,480
真的挺可爱
Yes, it was.

603
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,040
能把枕头递给我吗
Can you hand me that pillow?

604
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,530
为什么要离开公寓
So, why do you need to get out of your apartment?

605
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,840
感觉太小
It just felt small.

606
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,870
不会比我这儿还小
Well, it can't be smaller than my place.

607
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,190
不  不是面积小  是...
No. I don't mean size. I mean...

608
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,310
我感觉像一只困兽
I felt trapped.

609
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,510
好像我并不住在那里
Like I was in a place that I didn't actually live.

610
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,240
你能明白吗
Does that make any sense?

611
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,970
或许吧
I guess.

612
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,010
好了
Okay.

613
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,150
搞定
There you go.

614
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,730
你什么时候起床
Um, anytime you need to get up?

615
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,650
我用手机定闹钟就好
Um, I'll just set an alarm on my phone.

616
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,670
好吧  想看电视就看
All right. Well, feel free to watch TV.

617
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,010
再大声我都睡得着
I can sleep through anything.

618
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,320
谢谢你  卢卡斯
Hey, thank you, Lucas.

就剩这么点了
Hey, that's the last of it.

620
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,790
那可得好好利用
Better make it count, then.

621
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,350
喝光
Drink up.

622
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,770
你觉得我面熟吗
Do I look familiar to you?

623
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,400
面熟吗  不觉得
Familiar? No.

624
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,880
-脸和身体  -没印象
- My face? My body? - No.

625
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,970
那我的声音呢
How about my voice?

626
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,740
我们以前...
Have we...

627
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,950
没有
No.

628
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,880
不  我只是好奇
No. I was just wondering

629
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,140
你是不是偏爱蓝眼睛的褐发女人
if you had a thing for brunettes with blue eyes.

630
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,010
你去哪  回来
Hey, where you going? Come back here.

631
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,720
我想看得清楚点
I wanna see you better.

632
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,620
该死  天亮了
Shit. The sun's up?

亮了有一会儿了
Has been for a while.

634
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,530

- Oh, fuck. What time is it? - 7:15.

635
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,810
该死  我半小时后有个采访
Fuck. I have an interview in half an hour.

636
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,050
-别做了  -不行  必须得做

沙发床里有个弹簧还是什么  我的背

That's okay, Congressman.

686
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,220
这么早难免有点犯糊涂
It happens all the time this early in the morning.

687
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,900
议员先生  流域法案
So, Congressman, the watershed act.

688
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,380
是啊  我为此感到羞愧
Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed of the...

689
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,370
不  我并不感到羞愧  不对
well, I'm not ashamed. That's not the right, um...

690
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,140
我很失望  因为
I'm disappointed, um, because, you know,

691
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,660
流...
the water...

692
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,850
就是  其实我想说的是...
It's, um... it's... actually, what I'd like to discuss is...

693
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,810
大家都知道我们州的...
we all know that natural gas...

694
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,740
天然气一直...在发展
that it's... it's a growing... uh, in our state...

695
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,950
它是经济的...
it's a... it's a big part of, um...

696
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,330
重要部分...就目前情况而言
economically, the way things are going.

697
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,750
我想说...想宣布
And I'd like to say... to announce...

698
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,790
就某些方面
in terms of, um...

699
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,630
你熟悉开采条例吗
Are you familiar with drilling regulations...

700
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,180
开放使用和限制使用的
permitted use versus conditional use?

701
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,570
我们是在说流域法案吗
Are we still talking about the watershed?

702
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,460
不  开采  天然气
No. Drilling. Natural gas.

703
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,620
先生  你之前支持加大监管啊
Sir, you supported increased regulation.

704
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,630
不  我...
Well, no. I... I...

705
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,970
可能看起来是这样  但...
it may have looked that way, but, uh,

706
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,150
事实上  其实我是赞成少些...
in fact, to be clear, I'm for less...

707
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,720
监管的
regulation.

708
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,570
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

709
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,000
但流域法案中  清楚表明...
In the watershed bill, the language clearly stated...

710
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:23,760
但它没通过
It didn't pass.

711
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
没错  这就是我的问题
Well, right. That's what I'm asking about.

712
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,490
-什么意思  -它为什么没通过
- What about it? - Why it didn't pass?

713
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,810
我刚说了
I just said.

714
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,130
不  先生  我认为你没有
No, sir. I don't think you did.

715
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,510
它就是没通过
It just didn't.

716
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,280
先生  三天前  你预测说...
Sir, three days ago, you predicted...

717
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,410
我在说他妈的天然气
I'm talking about fucking natural gas.

718
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:42,800
对不起
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,090
议员先生  我得问你一个问题
Congressman, I have to ask you a question,

720
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,860
可能会有点唐突
and it may come across as indelicate,

721
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,880
你是不是喝醉了
but are you drunk right now?

722
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,990
什么  没有  没有  我没事  没事
What? No. No. I'm fine. I'm fine.

723
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,750
我只是...很累
I'm just... I'm really tired, you know?

724
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,690
佐伊  你要我提供些更好的新闻...

725
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,250
我忙了几周的竞选活动了
I've been on the campaign trail for a few weeks now,

726
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,050
议员先生
Congressman?

727
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,140
议员先生  议员先生  
Congressman? Congressman?

728
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,920
都是我的错
It's my fault.

729
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,520
我不该让你做的
I shouldn't have let you.

730
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,620
我完蛋了
I'm fucked.

731
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,030
听着  我们先帮你醒酒
Okay. Listen. We sober you up.

732
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:27,140
再尽快发表个声明
We'll make some kind of announcement as soon as possible.

733
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,280
说什么都没用了
There's nothing I can say.

734
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,010
我们会想出对策的
We'll figure this out.

735
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:34,850
起来
Come on.

736

这就对了  来吧
There you go. Come on.

739
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,540
有多糟
How bad is it?

740
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,820
关键要看
It all depends on whether

741
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,270
主流媒体会不会报道
it gets picked up by the mainstream press.

742
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,510
-那要告诉总统吗  -不用  先别说
- Well, shall I fill in the president? - No. Hold off on that.

743
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,660
我要和彼得谈一谈  协调一下他的竞选
I need to speak to Peter, coordinate with his campaign.

744
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,280

You'll be the first call I make.

745
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,680

Frank, before you go,

746
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,850
我早上收到一封电邮
I got an e-mail this morning.

斯坦福改变了决定
Stanford reversed their decision.

748
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,010
