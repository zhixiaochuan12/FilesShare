-副总统先生  -弗兰克
- Mr. Vice President. - Frank.

14
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,830
先生  请站在姓名标识处
Sir, I'm gonna need you to stand on your mark.

15
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,160
我站这儿就好了
I'm fine right here.

16
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,260
各位  还有两分钟
Two minutes, people.

17
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,280
他们把我从车里拖出来
So they pull me from the car.

18
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,320
俩腿都断了  颅骨撞裂了  
Both legs broken, fractured skull,

19
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,510
肺也刺穿了
punctured lung.

20
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,820
心脏停止跳动  整整两分钟
My heart stops. Two full minutes.

21
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,330
医生人工起搏  没反应
They're pumping my chest. Nothing.

22
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,740
又用了除纤颤器   嘭
They grab the defibrillators. Pachoom!

23
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,080
还是没反应
Nothing.

24
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,910
到第三次  心脏才开始跳动
Third time, the pistons start firing.

25
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,270
医生们说我能活下来是个奇迹
Doctors tell me it's a miracle I'm alive.

26
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,020
但要知道  这是上帝敲的警钟
But, seriously, you talk about a wake-up call from God.

27
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,640
死里逃生这种事不会有第二次
You don't get to come back from the dead twice.

28
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,110
美利坚合众国总统
The President of the United States.

29
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,430
早上好
Good morning.

30

《教育改革和成就法案》
that I sign into law today

32
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,470
与全国的孩子及家长息息相关
will affect every child and parent in the United States,

33
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,910
它将改善未来数十年的教学水平
will ensure a better educated workforce for decades to come,

34
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,390
巩固并强化美国
and will reinforce America's

35
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,760
作为教育强国的领先地位
preeminence as an intellectual superpower.

36
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,420
在此我要特别感谢一个人
And I'd like to thank one man in particular

37
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,180
他富有远见卓识  
who never lost sight of the larger mission,

38
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,600
并带领完成了这部法案
who spearheaded this bill from the beginning,

39
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,280
他就是弗兰克・安德伍德议员
and that's congressman Frank Underwood."

40
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,430
各位贵宾  东厅备有点心  请随我们来
Invited guests, please join us in the east room for refreshments.

41
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,450
媒体朋友们   
Media, we will

42
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,280
我们马上将在简报室集中开会
convene immediately in the briefing room for our conference.

43
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,550
谢谢你  琳达  法案能够顺利通过
Linda, thank you so much for all the help you gave us

44
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,510
你功不可没啊
in getting this bill passed.

45
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,820
不  谢谢你  弗兰克
No, thank you, Frank.

46
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,580
这完全是你的心血
This was your baby from the beginning.

47
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,900
幸好你能坚持己见  弗兰克
I appreciate you standing your ground on this one,  Frank.

48
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,000
我还知道有错就该承认
I'm smart enough to admit when I was wrong.

49
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,250
我刚才还跟弗兰克说该每周碰次面
I was just telling Frank we should set up a weekly

50
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,270
让他向我们汇报众议院那边的动态
so he can keep us up to date on what's going on in the house.

51
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,940
听上去是个好主意
That sounds like a great idea.

52
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,420
恭喜  先生
Congratulations, sir.

53
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,310
加勒特  我们能谈一下吗
Garrett, I was wondering if we could talk for a few minutes.

54
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,190
几周前我对你提起的那件事
That thing I mentioned a couple of weeks ago

55
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,280
有关就业税收抵免
about the jobs tax credit...

56
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
我想了很多  吉姆
I've been giving it a lot of thought, Jim,

57
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,280
觉得这主意不错
and I think it's a good idea.

58
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,260
不介意的话我想去翻翻备忘录
But I'd like to look over my notes first, if you don't mind,

59
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,890
这样就能和你自如探讨了
so I can talk about it intelligently with you.

60
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,480
先生  首相来电
Sir, you have your call with the Prime Minister.

61
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,320
大忙人
Busy man.

62
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
没错
Yes, he is.

63
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,050
弗兰克  听说你打算
Frank, I hear that you are heading up

64
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,220
去我家乡参与一场补选
the special election in my home state.

65
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,880
-彼得・罗素  -在正式声明前
- Peter Russo. - We're trying to keep that

66
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
我们打算低调行事
under the radar until he officially announces.

67
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,790
事实上  在那之前
In fact, we're not even working

68
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,380
我们都不在我办公室办公
out of my office until that happens.

69
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900
-那在哪呢  -我家地下室
- Where are you working from? - The basement of my house.

70
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,850
民主党全国委员会
Any reason why the D.N.C.

71
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,280
怎么不就候选人征询我呢
didn't ask my advice on the candidate?

72
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,600
我以为他们或琳达获得了你的首肯
Well, I thought they passed it by you, or Linda did.

73
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,580
-但他们没有  -这真是无法接受
- Nobody did. - Well, that is unacceptable.

74
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,510
而且我对罗素持怀疑态度
And I have major doubts about Russo.

75
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,050
-经验不足吗  -对  他立足于城市
- His inexperience? - Yes, and he's urban-based.

76
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,230
不知道他能不能和农村选民打交道
I don't know if he'll connect with rural voters.

77
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,400
老实说  这也是我的顾虑之一
Look, frankly, that's one of my concerns as well.

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,420
我们正在想办法
We're working on that.

79
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,470
但如果你能跟他一起做竞选宣传
But if you were to come out and stump with him,

80
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,790
那对他将极为有利
that would go a long way to convince...

81
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,220
弗兰克  我不能为我不信任的人作宣传
Frank, I can't stump for somebody I don't believe in.

82
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,120
现在还早  希望你别急着下定论
It's early days yet. I'd ask you to keep an open mind.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,340
如果想让我
And let me know if you want me

84
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,930
安排你们见面尽管说
to set up a meeting between the two of you,

85
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,470
因为你的支持  先生
because, sir, an endorsement from you

86
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,470
对他是莫大的帮助
would be a big coup for him.

87
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,520
见到你真好  副总统先生
It's good to see you, Mr. Vice President.

88
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,530
弗兰克
Frank.

89
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,860
安德伍德议员
Congressman Underwood?

90
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,370
巴恩斯小姐  我怎么记得
Miss Barnes, I was under the impression

91
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,940
你不想来做白宫记者
you didn't wanna cover the White House.

92
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,650
头条网昨天才拿到许可
Slugline just got access yesterday.

93
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,250
-我听说了  -我离开《先驱报》
- I know. - I left the Herald

94
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,860
正是因为不愿来白宫
because I didn't wanna cover the White House,

95
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,920
现在我还是来了
and now here I am.

96
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,260
许可和镣铐还是有点区别的
Access isn't the same as a ball and chain.

97
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,400
我只有在签法案时才能见到你咯
Am I only gonna see you at bill signings now?

98
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,810
我已经三周没有你的消息了
I haven't heard from you in three weeks.

99
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,430
没有安全感很无聊
Insecurity bores me.

100
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,450
居高临下也让我觉得无聊
I feel the same way about condescension.

101
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,230
今晚你家见
Your place, this evening,

102
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,350
来之前我会给你短信
and I'll text you when I'm about to arrive.

103
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,590
要是我到时候在忙呢
What if I'm busy?

104
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,140
你只是怕再被放鸽子
You're just afraid I'm gonna stand you up again.

105
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,100
我只想确定这值得我等
I just wanna make sure it's worth my while.

106
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,590
会值得的
It'll be worth your while.

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
这是对上次的补偿
This'll make up for last time.

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,340
历史的见证物
It's a piece of history.

109
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,790
从总统手里传到了你这儿
From the President's hand to yours.

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,670
你相信他们刚刚说的上帝什么的吗
You believe in all that higher-power stuff they talk about in the room?

111
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,950
我相信总有事情是我们无法掌控的
I believe there are things beyond our control.

112
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,530
至于谁掌控着这些事  我不知道
Who or what's controlling them... that I don't know.

113
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,660
我不相信上帝
I don't believe in God.

114
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,610
天堂  地狱  什么都不信
Heaven, hell. None of it.

115
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,340
-天主教会学校上多了  -或许吧
- Too much catholic school? - Maybe.

116
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,660
彼得  我不是说你非得信上帝
I'm not saying you have to believe in God, Peter,

117
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,280
或者其他任何事
or anything, for that matter.

118
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,330
但也别急着否定一切
But you shouldn't rule anything out.

119
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,430
我要走了
I should go.

120
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,200
帐记在竞选经费上
It's on the campaign.

121
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,300
道格・斯坦普  收

122
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,260
我还需要钱  别塞嘴里

123
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,460
民调数据显示81%可能投票的选民
Our crosstabs show 81% of likely voters

124
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,360
会考虑投给戒酒的候选人
are willing to consider a recovering alcoholic.

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
如果换成可卡因的话这个数字会下降
Now, those numbers dip a little when you introduce cocaine,

126
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,160
但不会下降很多
but not by much.

127
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,140
兰迪
Randy?

128
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,940
有风险  不过轰动是肯定的
It's a risk, but it'll make waves.

129
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,150
免费得到主流媒体的关注和报道
Free coverage across the board.

130
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,910
竞选主题得是救赎
The narrative has to be redemption.

131
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,450
凤凰从灰烬中涅
A Phoenix from the ashes.

132
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,050
就别提灰烬了
Well, let's not focus on the ashes.

133
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,560
别让大家觉得彼得过去一团乱
We don't want people to think Peter was a disaster.

134
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,520
不  我们侧重积极的一面
No, no. We focus on the positive.

135
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,550
"崭新"或"干净"的开始
A "Fresh start" And a "Clean start"

136
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,790
焦点小组对这两个词都很喜欢
both did well in focus groups.

137
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,150
"干净的开始"听着像是洗白的
"Clean start" sounds too much like "Clean slate."

138
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,290
-我喜欢"崭新的开始"  -我也是
- I like "Fresh start." - Yeah, I do too.

139
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,470
筹款怎么样了
How we doing on the fund-raising?

140
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,000
酗酒史会使他失去一些州内捐款
The alcoholic thing will turn off some of the in-state donors,

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
但这不是大型选举
but it's an off-year election.

142
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,490
我们可以去纽约和加州找找老金主
We can hit up the usual suspects in New York and California.

143
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,820
沃尔特  我们有多少弱点
Walter, how vulnerable are we?

144
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,190
这还难说
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

145
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,930
彼得还没向我忏悔呢
Peter and I have yet to perform the holy sacrament of confession.

146
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,830
关闭造船厂一事我们也得有所表示
We still need to address the shipyard closing too.

147
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,040
这方面克莱尔在处理
Claire's helping us with that.

148
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,700
我们在推动一项
We are pushing a bill

149
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,870
《特拉华河流域法案》
called the Delaware river watershed Act,

150
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,540
预计将在三年内
and I think it's going to bring about

151
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,820
为彼得的选区带来约五千个岗位
5,000 jobs into Peter's district over the next three years.

152
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,280
我们已经完成了一份草案
We have a draft of the bill completed.

153
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,290
彼得正在找法案的连署者
Peter's in the process of securing cosponsors.

154
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,280
对了  你都问过谁了
And who have you called, by the way?

155
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,110
我发了几份邮件
I have some e-mails out,

156
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,540
大多数想先看看法案
but most of them wanna see a bill first.

157
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,480
船厂那边你约过谁见面了吗
Have you set up a meeting with the shipbuilders yet?

158
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
我不认为他们会支持我
I don't think they're gonna back me.

159
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,110
法案就是为了他们啊  彼得
That's the entire point of the bill, Peter.

160
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,890
如果我去跟他们说
Well, if I go to them and I say,

161
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,690
你们有些人可能会重新找到工作
"Hey, some of you maybe will get your jobs back,

162
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,270
不过不是明天  而是三年后
"Not tomorrow, but three years from now,

163
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,410
大多数还得继续失业在家
and most of you won't be getting your jobs back anyway... "

164
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,710
好吧  先找联署人  这事暂且放一边
All right, let's put a pin in this until we get more sponsors.

165
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,770
我要回趟办公室  晚点再过来
I have to go to the office. I'll catch you all later.

166
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,890
好了  说一下竞选方案吧
Okay, let's move on to our field plan.

167
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,560
要逐个区讨论...
I want to go through the regions one by one...

168
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,510
弗兰西斯
Francis.

169
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,650
我们在这个法案上花了六周时间
We spent six weeks on that bill.

170
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,450
不会有问题  他会想明白的
It'll be fine. He'll come around.

171
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,170
那晚上见
I'll see you later tonight?

172
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,620
我有约了
I have an appointment.

173
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,110
那我明天早上才能见到你了
So I won't see you until morning.

174
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,930
我会在你起床前回来
I'll be back before you get up.

175
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,200
感谢你今天能抽出时间过来  先生
I appreciate your taking the time today, sir.

176
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,150
经济研究小组起草的
Did you get that tax credit memo

177
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,650
税收抵免备忘录你拿到了吗
the economic research team put together?

178
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,300
你叫我来不是为了讨论备忘录吧
You didn't ask me here to talk about memos.

179
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,020
有话直说吧  琳达
I know small talk when I hear it, Linda.

180
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,140
总统希望你
The President has asked

181
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,420
不要过分插手宾州的事务
that you take a step back from Pennsylvania.

182
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,920
你最近经常去那儿
You've been taking a lot of trips there,

183
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,620
与立法者会面...
meeting with legislators...

184
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,680
那是我的家乡  而且正面临着就业危机
It's my home state. There's a jobs crisis.

185
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,440
我们不能偏帮单个州
We can't afford to play favorites.

186
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,890
我们的方针是五十个州  一套解决方案
The message is 50 states, one solution;

187
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,920
而不是一个州  五十套方案
not one state, 50 solutions.

188
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,350
我并没指望能参与每一项政策和决策的制定
I never expected to be involved in every policy or decision,

189
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,610
但我现在是什么事都被蒙在鼓里
but I have been completely cut out of everything.

190
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,130
我们很重视你的意见  副总统先生
We value your input, Mr. Vice President,

191
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,940
但现在我们不能...
but right now, we can't...

192
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,100
别一副高高在上的口气  琳达
Don't condescend, Linda.

193
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,590
甚至都没人问我希望由谁来接替州长一职
No one even asked me who I thought should fill my seat.

194
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,390
为什么这事是弗兰克・安德伍德牵头而不是我
Why is Frank Underwood leading the charge on that, not me?

195
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,030
那是民主党全国委员会的决定
That is a D.N.C. issue.

196
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,000
我们不会插手  你也一样
We are staying out of it and so should you.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,090
那我就只能负责剪彩和出席葬礼吗
And so I'm supposed to just cut ribbons and go to funerals?

198
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,390
你应该清楚你的职责范围
You knew what you signed up for.

199
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,810
谢谢你  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

200
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,960
我没拿到我的钢笔
I didn't get my pen.

201
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,320
-你的钢笔  -签署法案的笔
- Your pen? - From the bill signing.

202
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,520
我们会想办法解决的
Oh, we'll see what we can do about that.

203
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,970
我看到你的保镖了
I can see your security guy.

204
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,210
密查姆吗
Meechum?

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,420
他可真帅
He's cute.

206
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,630
他不会喜欢你的
He'd never go for you.

207
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
为什么
Why not?

208
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,940
你令他生畏
You're too intimidating.

209
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,400
可他有枪啊
He's the one with the gun.

210
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,430
但你有议员
But you're the one with the congressman.

211
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,680
我们做完再谈
We'll talk after.

212
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,250
我们谈完再做
We'll talk before.

213
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,320
彼得・罗素
Peter Russo.

214
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,620
宾州第一选区的议员
Pennsylvania's first district.

215
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,470
他会竞选州长
He's gonna run for governor.

216
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,620
接替马修斯的职位
Fill Matthews' seat.

217
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,210
这会是一篇独家专访
It's an exclusive profile.

218
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,980
但对象是个无名小卒
With someone no one's ever heard of.

219
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,770
报道角度呢
What's the angle?

220
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,370
酗酒  吸毒
Alcohol, drugs.

221
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,820
他是个出身贫寒的野孩子
He's a kid from the streets.

222
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,320
我希望专访能在他宣布参选后马上发布
I want the profile to come out as soon as he announces,

223
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,750
并且向着他说话
and I'd like it to be kind.

224
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,520
我不写吹捧报道
I don't write puff pieces.

225
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,660
那就找别人写
Then get someone else to write it.

226
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,620
我以为你有料给我
I thought you had something for me.

227
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,210
人们很容易就会猜到我是你的消息来源
It's too easy for people to link me as your source.

228
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,230
那就危险了
It's dangerous.

229
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,200
把头条让给别人  我得不到好处啊
I don't benefit from handing out headlines to other people.

230
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,770
别低估了慷慨的力量  佐伊
Generosity is its own form of power, Zoe.

231
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,660
第六步
Step six.

232
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,650
第七步
Step seven.

233
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,170
你总是大晚上戴墨镜吗
You always wear sunglasses at night?

234
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,620
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

235
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,770
我猜你肯定是公务员
I figured you had to be in government.

236
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,700
就在网上搜索  终于找到你的照片
I kept googling till I found your picture.

237
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,740
这招没用的
This won't work, what you're doing.

238
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,140
那次是一锤子买卖
It was a one-time deal.

239
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,120
你不能一直要挟我
You don't get to keep coming back for more.

240
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,250
我会去报警
I'll go to the police.

241
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,840
他们只会当面嘲笑你  瞧你这样子
They'll laugh in your face. Look at you.

242
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,490
如果警察不信我
If the police won't listen to me,

243
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,130
我就爆料给电视台
I'll call TV stations.

244
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,950
我知道你们是谁
I know the names...

245

道格拉斯・斯坦普  彼得・罗素
Douglas Stamper, Peter Russo,

246
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,650
弗兰克・安德伍德
Frank Underwood.

247
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,580
你现在走的是条危险的路
You are walking down a road you do not want to walk down.

248
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,930
求你了  我不会说出去的
Please, I won't call anyone.

249
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,920
但我需要你的帮助
But I need your help.

250
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,970
我无处可去  没有人可以联系
I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have anyone I can call.

251
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,720
我不再想做我现在做的一些事了
I've had to do things. And I don't wanna do it anymore.

252
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,320
现在我身上就这么多
That's all I've got right now.

253
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,920
找个住处  告诉我地址
Find a place to stay and let me know where you are.

254
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,220
我会再想办法的
I'll figure something out.

255
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,620
饿吗
You hungry?

256

266

-天呐  怎么可能  -在孩子面前抽过吗

268
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,900
听着  我不是个绝世好爸
Look, I'm not the world's best dad,

269
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,140
但我绝不会做那种事
but I would never do that.

270
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,690
好的  我们来谈谈招妓问题吧
Fine. Let's move on to prostitution.

271
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,810
还要问多久
How long is this gonna take?

272
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,630
直到我完全了解你为止
Until there's nothing I don't know about you.

273
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,020
我全都写下来了
I wrote all this down.

274
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,250
我做这行很久了  议员先生
I've been doing this a long time, congressman.

275
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,320
我知道什么时候才算完
I know when I've scraped all the shit off the shoe.

299
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,600
你想知道我来过几次高潮吗
You wanna know how many times I came?

300
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,990
我根本不在乎你能否当选
I honestly don't care whether you win.

301
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,250
但你想当选  就得跟我合作
But if you do, work with me.

302
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,990
你在特区多久招一回妓
How often did you solicit prostitutes in D.C.?

303
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,520
两到三个月一次
Once every two or three months.

304
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,270
有时频繁些  有时会少些
Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.

305
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,240
你有理由相信她们中有人未成年吗
Do you have reason to believe any of them were underage?

306
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
天呐  没有  大多是高端妓女
Jesus! No. Look, they were mostly high-end.

307
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
那不代表她们都到18岁了
That doesn't mean they were 18.

308
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,850
我得休息一下
I need a fucking break!

309
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,050
怎么了
What's going on?

310
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,530
他道行太浅  弗兰克
He's an amateur, Frank.

311
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,340
如果我不到一小时就激怒了他
If I can get under his skin in less than an hour,

312
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,940
面对媒体攻击他能撑多久呢
how do you think he'll hold up under the press?

313
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,240
会被人当活靶子打
It'll be a Turkey shoot.

314
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,480
知道了  我会跟他谈的
All right. I'll speak to him.

315
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,520
弗兰克  这...不行
Frank, it's just... it's not gonna work.

316
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,580
我会被折磨死的
I'm gonna get crucified.

317
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,250
没事的  我们有最好的团队帮你
You'll be fine. We've got a crack team behind you.

318
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,590
不是说团队好就行了
It doesn't matter how good the team is.

319
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,040
像我这样的过去  算了吧
I mean with my past? Come on.

320
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,400
我一开始就把方案告诉你了
From the very beginning, I said this was the plan.

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,260
-你也同意的  -当时我没考虑清楚
- You agreed to it. - I didn't think it through.

322
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,600
我们必须直面这些问题
We have to tackle this head-on,

323
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,890
否则共和党就真要整死你了
or the G.O.P. will crucify you.

324
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,350
我们需要借力打力
We have to steal their ammunition from them.

325
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,650
坦诚是你最佳防御也是最佳攻击
Honesty is your best defense and offense.

326
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,510
要上镜头说这些话的人是我
I'm the one that has to get in front of these cameras and say this shit.

327
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,190
他们又不用说  是我
They don't have to say it. I do.

328
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
-彼得...  -我想成为州长  真的
- Peter... - I wanna be governor. I do.

329
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,870
但不能以这种方式  我做不来
But not this way. I just can't do it.

330
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,100
如果你现在没打退堂鼓
If you weren't unsure now,

331
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,720
那才叫有毛病呢
there'd be something wrong with you.

332
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,360
这是预料之中
I expected this.

333
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,510
我们要你做的事并不容易
Not easy... what we're asking you to do.

334
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,460
犹豫是正常的
It's okay to vacillate a little.

335
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,540
我不是想妨碍你们
I'm not trying to throw a wrench in the works.

336
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,300
这我知道  跟你说
I know you're not. I'll tell you what.

337
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,510
你今天先回去吧
You take the rest of the day off.

338
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,360
回你办公室去
You go back to your office,

339
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,690
赶一下落下的工作
you catch up with whatever you have to catch up on,

340
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,700
回去睡个好觉  明天开个会
you get a good night's sleep, you go to a meeting tomorrow,

341
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,770
然后再过来  我们把整件事好好谈谈
and then you come here and we'll talk the whole thing through.

342
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,290
这你总能办到吧
Can you give me at least that?

343
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,820
好的  没问题  弗兰克
Yeah. Okay, Frank.

344
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,890
很好
Good.

345
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,150
那些小折纸是怎么回事
What's going on with all the little sculptures?

346
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,350
我在餐桌上看到一朵花
I found a flower on the dining room table

347
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,200
几天前床头柜上还有只鸟
and a bird on the nightstand a few days ago.

348
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,400
那是天鹅
It's a swan.

349
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,680
都是你做的
You made them?

350
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,440
是的
Yes.

351
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,970
新爱好吗
A new hobby?

352
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,630
不是
No.

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,320
只是心血来潮而已
It's an interest.

354
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,420
能说说我留意到的另一件事吗
May I bring up something else I've noticed?

355
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,370
什么事
What's that?

356
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,080
你...
You...

357
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,040
站在冰箱前面
standing in front of the refrigerator.

358
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,100
你为什么一直都没有跟我谈
Is there a reason you haven't talked to me about it?

359
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,380
因我觉得没必要
I haven't felt the need to.

360
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,280
严重吗
Is it bad?

361
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,990
不是什么好事
It's not pleasant.

362
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,740
不过  并不严重
But, no, it's not bad.

363
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,770
我能做什么吗
What can I do?

364
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,720
不用
Nothing.

365
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,060
如果有需要我会告诉你的
If there was something, I'd ask.

366
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,810
我打电话给你  你觉得奇怪吗
Did you think it was weird that I called you?

367
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,430
简直太奇怪了
Totally weird.

368
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,270
不过我那时也正好想打给你
Except for the fact that I was planning on calling you.

369
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,940
是吗  为什么
Really? Why?

370
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,330
我在《先驱报》时对你态度很不好
I was a real grade-A bitch to you at the Herald,

371
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,290
在白宫见到你时  我差点想道歉了
and I almost apologized when I saw you at the White House,

372
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,290
但我退缩了
but I chickened out.

373
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,600
反正我也喝高了  对不起
So, anyway, I am drunk enough, and I am sorry.

374
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,230
你为什么打电话给我呢
Why did you call me?

375
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,210
我只是想知道
I was just wondering how

376
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,640
咱们老地方现在怎么样了
things were going at the old stomping ground.

377
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,820
-你的酒  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

378
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,660
汤姆离开后就不一样了
It's just not the same since tom left.

379
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,590
我倒不怪你那么做
And I don't blame you for doing what you did.

380
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,700
可新来的这家伙
But this new guy?

381
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,450
在网版《娱乐周刊》干了六年
Six years running E.W. Online

382
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,520
可不是做总编的材料
does not a managing editor make.

383
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,550
你想过来我们这儿工作吗
Would you ever wanna come work with us?

384
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,940
那可是个大事啊
I mean, it'd be a huge fucking deal.

385
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,870
《先驱报》的首席政治记者
Chief political correspondent of the Herald

386
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,380
跳槽到头条网
moves to Slugline?

387
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,630
是卡莉・希斯让你来劝我的吗
Did carly heath put you up to this?

388
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,880
不  跟她没关系
No. Not at all.

389
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,160
不过如果你想  我可以跟她谈谈
But if you want, I can talk to her.

390
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,250
你觉得她会同意吗
You think she would go for it?

391
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,390
老实说  我也不知道
Honestly, I don't know.

392
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,860
她对正统比较不屑一顾
She's got this sort of anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.

393
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,350
常规的新闻她不感兴趣
Conventional news bores her.

394
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,750
但你要是有猛料...
But if you had something gritty to show...

395
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,510
要是你有兴趣  我倒是有料
I've got a story if you want it.

396
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,030
而且是惊天猛料
It's pretty fucking great.

397
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,610
你要把新闻让我
You would give away a story?

398
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,000
如果你没兴趣就算了
If you're not interested...

399
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,090
不  我感兴趣
no, I'm interested.

400
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,630
如果我有点像宿醉未醒  是因为事实如此
If I seem a little hung over, it is because I am.

401
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,890
其实还不止有点
A lot hung over, actually.

402
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,710
天呐  我都戒了几个月了
God, I almost had a couple of months,

403
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,430
然后昨天晚上  我...
and then last night, I...

404
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,020
其实我也不太记得了
Well, I don't remember much, so...

405
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,980
无论如何  我回来了
But anyway, here I am.

406
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,280
坚持来
Keep coming back.

407
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,700
努力就会有回报
It works if you work it.

408
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,220
谢谢你的分享  戴安
Thank you for sharing, Diane.

409
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
我是道格  我是个酒鬼
I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic.

410
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,190
道格  你好
Hi, Doug.

411
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,420
我工作的一部分就是数数
One of the things I do for a living is count.

412
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,130
我数选票
I count votes.

413
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,720
同意票  反对票  中立票  弃权票
Yeas, nays, neutrals, abstaining.

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,560
而且我很熟练
And I'm good at it.

415
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,770
不过对我最重要的数字跟工作无关
But the most important count I do has nothing to do with work.

416
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,650
而是从1999年4月4日至今的天数
It's the number of days since April 4, 1999.

417
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,200
截止今早  一共有5185天
As of this morning, that's 5,185.

418
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,360
数字越大  我越感到害怕
The bigger that number gets, the more it frightens me,

419
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,230
因为我知道一杯酒就能让数字清零
because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero.

420
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,120
很多人认为恐惧是弱点
Most people see fear as a weakness.

421
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,910
有时是的
It can be.

422
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,570
有时由于工作的关系  我要让他人生惧
Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear in other people.

423
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,670
我知道那样不对
I know that's not right.

424
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,170
但如果按第四步说的那样  实话实说
But if I'm honest, like the fourth step asks us to be,

425
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,990
互诫会的"十二步骤"  第四步: 做一次彻底勇敢的自我道德反省

426
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,930
我必须残忍  因为我不能失败
I have to be ruthless, because failure is not an option.

427
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,600
戒酒也是如此
The same goes for my sobriety.

428
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,050
我要对自己残忍
I have to be ruthless with myself.

429
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,960
我得利用恐惧
I have to use my fear.

430
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,570
它让我变得坚强
It makes me stronger.

431
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,850
就像在座各位  我无法改变本性
Like everyone in this room, I can't control who I am.

432
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,390
但我能控制那个零
But I can control the zero.

433
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,460
让那个零去死吧
Fuck the zero.

434
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,910
多谢分享
Thanks for sharing.

435
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,250
努力就会有回报
It works if you work it.

436
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,970
接下来谁想分享
Who would like to share next?

437
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,360
-他参加互诫会了吗  -是的
- Was he at the meeting? - He was.

438
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
之后我想找他
I tried to find him afterwards,

439
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,050
但我追上去时他已经没影了
but he was gone before I could catch up with him.

440
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,650
-他说什么了吗  -没有
- Did he say anything? - No.

441
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,170
他从不分享  满腹心事的样子
He never shares. He looked preoccupied.

442
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,080
-他今天会去众议院吗  -我不清楚
- You think he'll show up at the house today? - I have no idea.

443
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,730
他不接我的电话
He's not answering my calls.

444
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,080
也不接我的  还有别的事吗
Mine neither. Anything else I need to know?

445
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,130
我听见沉默了  我可不喜欢那声音
I hear silence. I don't like that sound.

446
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,040
出了些事情  我在处理
Something came up. I'm handling it.

447
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,070
-严重吗  -严重但能解决
- Something serious? - Serious but solvable.

448
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,460
我需要知道更多吗
Do I wanna know more?

449
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
不用  我们会没事的
I don't think you do. We'll be okay.

450
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,230
我可能会要南茜帮忙  但愿用不着
I might have to involve Nancy. I'm hoping I won't have to.

451
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,950
即使别无他法  也不会让她知道什么不利的事
But if I do, she'll have no knowledge of anything damaging.

452
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,610
好吧  你自己想好就行
All right. Use your best judgment.

453
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,990
当然  先生
Of course, sir.

454
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,600
我得挂了
I've gotta go.

455
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,430
盖拉格小姐
Miss Gallagher?

456
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,120
议员有话想和你说
Can the congressman have a moment?

457
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,340
事情  很复杂
Things are... they're complicated.

458
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,180
我知道  但他真的需要你
I realize that, but he truly needs you.

459
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,290
我不知道能和他说什么
I don't know what I could say to him.

460
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,020
我想你的出现就能让他好很多
I think just showing up would do him a world of good.

461
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,560
我今天很忙  议长的日程表很满
Today is tough. The speaker has a full schedule...

462
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,600
我已经和鲍勃谈过了
Look, I already spoke to Bob,

463
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,240
他同意让你今天休假
and he said he'd be fine if you took the rest of the day off.

464
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,230
事实上  如果你想休半年
In fact, he said he'd be fine if you wanted to take

465
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,350
-他也同意  -什么
- the next six months off. - What?

466
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,890
我想让你做副竞选经理
I want you to be deputy campaign manager.

467
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,790
在纳什・埃伦斯手下干
You work under Nash Aarons.

468
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,750
不  我给彼得当了好几年的拐杖
No. I spent years being Peter's crutch.

469
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,740
如果你只是想让我去...
If you just want me there...

470
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,920
我们当然想让你去帮忙  但不是做拐杖
Well, of course we want you there to help, but not as a crutch.

471
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,940
彼得是个有才华又有潜力的年轻人
Peter is a talented young man with a lot of potential.

472
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,850
这他知道  但他需要我之外的人的认同
He knows this, but he needs to hear it from someone other than me.

473
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,500
某个他真心在乎的人
Someone he truly cares about.

474
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,150
抱歉  我一下子接受不了
I'm sorry. This is just a lot right now.

475
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,660
你不用马上做决定
Well, you don't have to make a decision now,

476
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,950
但至少和彼得谈谈
but at least talk to Peter.

477
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,150
这总没什么坏处  是吗
I mean, there's no harm in that, now, is there?

478
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,290
一万块
Ten grand.

479
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,640
从你的竞选账户里出
We divert it from your campaign accounts.

480
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
-分散款项  做成...  -等等
- We itemize it so it looks like... - Wait.

481
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,500
你要我为这事买单
You want me to pay for this?

482
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,940
去用弗兰克的连任基金
Use Frank's reelection fund.

483
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,090
局长  你筹集到的大部分钱
Commissioner, the majority of the money that you've raised

484
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,770
都来自于我们为你找的资助人
has come from people we've sent your way.

485
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,920
那是因为
And you sent them because

486
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,040
我摆平了罗素的事在先
I sprung your boy Russo in the first place.

487
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,160
我们扯平了  我不欠你的
We're even. I don't owe you shit.

488
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,460
这女孩有麻烦  我们得帮她
There's a girl in trouble. Let's help her out.

489
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,260
-不是我的问题  -这难说
- Not my problem. - It could be.

490
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,540
我们不管她
We put her back on the streets,

491
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,820
她不一定会做出什么事
there's no telling what she could do.

492
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,450
比起一个妓女
I'm a hell of a lot more afraid

493
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,510
我更怕联邦检察官
of the U.S. attorney than I am of some hooker.

494
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,470
这是张廉价的保单
This is a very inexpensive insurance policy.

495
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,450
我已经犯过一次法了  道格
I already broke the law once, Doug.

496
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,860
我绝不会违反竞选法规
There's no fucking way I'm gonna mess with campaign finance regulations.

497
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,740
我不想再听这些屁话了
I don't even wanna be hearing this shit.

498
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,970
前日本大使的葬礼  明早九点半
Funeral for the former ambassador of Japan tomorrow at 9:30,

499
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,840
接下来是美国女童子军
followed by a luncheon for the national board

500
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,290
全国理事会的午餐会
of directors for the girl scouts of America.

501
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,480
-总统先生  -吉姆
- Mr. President. - Jim.

502
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,980
之后是和决赛选手的见面会...
After that, you've got a meet and greet with the finalist...

503
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,360
等会儿再说吧
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

504
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,780
这边走  先生
This way, sir.

505
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,320
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

506
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,560
议员先生让我过来的
The congressman wanted me to come over.

507
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,480
-为什么  -他要我帮你竞选
- Why? - He wants me to work for your campaign.

508
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,910
-做你的副竞选经理  -弗兰克
- Deputy Manager. - Frank!

509
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,080
他说你还有些顾虑
He said you're having some doubts.

510
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,770
我正想告诉他我决定不参选了
I was just about to tell him that I decided not to run.

511
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,060
好吧  如果你已经决定了
Okay. Um, if you've made up your mind,

512
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,720
那我或许该走了
then I should probably get going.

513
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,760
他把整个计划都告诉你了吗
Did he tell you about the whole plan?

514
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,860
要我坦白一切
About coming clean?

515
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,400
对  他说了
Yeah, he did.

516
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,560
我得为凯文和萨拉考虑
I have Kevin and Sarah to think about.

517
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,820
-每个人都有过去  -但不像我这样
- Everyone has a past. - Not like mine.

518
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
你不知道我太多事  克里斯蒂娜
You don't know half the things I've done, Christina.

519
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,750
我的孩子识字  他们的朋友识字
My kids read. Their friends read.

520
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,280
我不能冒这个险
I can't take that chance.

521
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,050
如果你不想竞选  那就退出
Look, if you don't wanna run, then you shouldn't.

522
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,060
我想竞选
I do wanna run.

523
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,060
如果我不想就不会走到这一步
I wouldn't have let it go this far if I didn't want it.

524
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,730
那或许这会是件好事...
Then maybe it's a good thing...

525
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,930
直面你的过去  对你的孩子也好
confronting your past, even for your kids.

526
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,550
他们比你想的要坚强得多
They're a lot stronger than you give them credit for.

527
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,250
如果安德伍德和民主党全国委员会
Look, if Underwood, if the D.N.C.,

528
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,380
他们都认为你能行  那么...
if they all think you can do it, then...

529
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,170
我不在乎他们怎么想  我在乎你怎么想
I don't care what they think. I care what you think.

530
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,800
我认为你会很棒的
I think you'd be great.

531
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,690
-她真想来  -反正我是这么觉得
- So, she really wants this? - That's the impression I got.

532
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,550
她脾气怎么样  我可不想招个耍大牌的来
What about ego? I don't need to be dealing with a diva.

533
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,710
她不是那样的  她是个有15年经验的
She's not a diva, she's an award-winning journalist

534
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,400
获过奖的记者
with 15 years' experience.

535
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,470
是你跟我说她待你很糟
You told me she treated you like shit.

536
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,000
我们之间是有过不快
There was some friction.

537
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,430
那你现在为什么替她说话
So why are you going to bat for her?

538
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,130
难道你不想和最优秀的人一起工作吗
Don't we want to work with the best people?

539
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,710
再说  这对网站也很有利
Plus, it'd be big for the site.

540
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,470
《先驱报》的资深政治记者
The Herald's senior political writer?

541
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,770
话是没错  但她太保守了
Sure, but she's so old guard.

542
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,760
什么都照规矩做
Everything's by the book.

543
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,920
这可没什么意思
There's no bite to it.

544
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,820
她跟我说了她正在做的一篇专访
She told me about a profile she's working on.

545
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,320
-很有意思呢  -关于什么的
- It's got serious bite. - What is it?

546
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,520
让她自己告诉你  你应该跟她谈谈
She can tell you herself. You should talk to her.

547
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,600
这是我的条件
Here's the deal.

548
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,250
不要牵涉到我的孩子
My children stay out of the limelight.

549
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,750
不让他们上镜  或面对媒体
No photo ops, no press.

550
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,630
这是当然
We wouldn't dream of it.

551
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,690
那好
Okay.

552
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,100
我们干吧
Let's do this.

553
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:51,040
汽车旅馆

554
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,950
坐下吧
Sit down.

555
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,020
-你是哪里人  -林奇堡城外
- Where you from? - Outside of Lynchburg.

556
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,800
-弗吉尼亚州的  -对
- Virginia? - Yeah.

557
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,630
-你父母还住那儿吗  -我不能去找他们
- Are your parents still living there? - No. I can't.

558
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,170
如果我给你找个地方住
If I find a place for you to stay for a while,

559
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,610
你能乖乖的吗
can I count on you to be smart?

560
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,510
-什么样的地方  -很不错的地方
- What kind of place? - A nice place.

561
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,340
安全的地方  让我们有时间想出长久之计
A safe place until we can figure out something permanent.

562
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,940
但我需要知道你不会再做这种事了
But I need to know that you won't pull anything like this again.

563
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,510
向我保证
Promise me.

564
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,270
我保证
I promise.

565
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,520
看着我的眼睛说
Look at me when you say it.

566
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,730
我向你保证
I promise you.

567
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,590
钱还够花吗
How you doing on money?

568
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,390
不够明天花的
I don't have enough for tomorrow.

569
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,390
你干什么
What are you doing?

570
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,520
我以为你要我...
I thought you wanted me to...

571
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,890
你说过不再干了
You said you were done with that.

572
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,380
我会联系你的
I'll be in touch.

573
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,030
性行为: 男性性伙伴: 无; 女性性伙伴: 多个

574
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,310
如果只承认其中一部分事
If you own up to some of the shenanigans,

575
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,400
把其他的掩盖起来  或许还有机会
sweep the rest under the rug, you might have a shot.

576
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,790
得掩盖多少
How much do we have to sweep under?

577
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,630
性经历  招妓  非传统性行为

578
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,450
这孩子隐藏踪迹倒是有一套
Well, the kid had a talent for covering his tracks.

579
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,520
我把他该承认的东西都标出来了
I've highlighted all the items I think he should admit to.

吸毒: 从未吸食海洛因; 曾吸食可卡因; 酗酒

00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,160
其他的就别提了
The rest I wouldn't mention.

582
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,600
不能说的还挺多
It's a lot not to talk about.

583
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,520
-我需要你帮忙  -现在吗
- I need your help with something. - Right now?

584
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,930
-对  -重要吗
- Yes. - Is it important?

585
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,760
你之前说我这周末可以早点下班
Because you told me I could leave early this weekend

586
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,350
去弗吉尼亚看望我女儿
to go visit my daughter down in Virginia.

587
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,280
你家里有客房吧
You have a guest room in your house, right?

588
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,750
有  原来是玛丽的房间
Well, it's Mary's old room, but, yes.

589
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,420
我想让一个年轻女人去你那儿住一段时间
I need you to put someone up for a while. A young woman.

-什么  谁  -她叫瑞秋

只能告诉你这些
I can't tell you anymore than that.

592
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,840
我不明白  你为什么
I don't understand. Why do you need...

593
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,080
别问了  南茜  我需要你帮我
No questions, Nancy. I just need you to do this for me.

594
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,990
如果不重要我就不会开口了
I wouldn't be asking if it weren't serious.

595
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,340
要住多长时间
Put up for how long?

596
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,020
不知道  可能得有一段时间
I don't know. It could be a while.

597
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,470
你让一个陌生人去我家住
I'm supposed to put up a complete stranger

598
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,320
还不许我提问吗
and not ask any questions?

599
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,070
南茜  求你了
Nancy, please.

600
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,120
你是我唯一能信任的人
You're the only person I can trust.

601
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,830
有什么违法的事吗
Is something illegal going on?

602
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,350
没有  她只是碰上了点麻烦
No. She's just a girl in trouble

603
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,520
需要找个地方避避
who needs a place to stay.

604
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,870
-我们得小心点  -至少让我先见见她吧
- We have to be discreet. - Can I at least meet her first?

605
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,880
我现在就要答复
I need to know now.

606
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,380
好吧
Okay, I guess.

607
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,550
谢谢
Thank you.

608
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,400
没什么条件  拉里
There's no catch, Larry.

609
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,380
款项落实  你的选区就能拿到两千多万
Your district gets over 20 million if the numbers hold.

610
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,070
其中大多数将用于经济发展
And most of the money is earmarked for economic development,

611
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,270
而非科研
not research.

612
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,500
太棒了  但我不仅需要你的支持
That's great, but I need more than your support.

613
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,950
我需要你跟我连署
I need you to be a sponsor.

614
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,050
好极了  拉里
Fantastic, Larry.

615
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,530
太棒了  我要挂了
Great. I'll put you down.

616
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,400
你也是  再见
You too. Bye.

617
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,540
那就只剩克雷伯恩...和普莱斯是吗
So that just leaves Clayburn... and Price?

618
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,950
詹宁斯仍在观望
With Jennings on the fence.

619
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,800
我认识罗杰  我打给他
And I know Roger. I'll call him.

620
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,740
我这周末会跟进另外两人
And I'll track down these other two over the weekend.

621
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,520
今天真的很棒  彼得
Really good work today, Peter.

622
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,220
你看见我的手提包了吗
Do you know where I put my purse?

623
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,130
在这儿
It's right here.

624
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,480
这些是你折的吗
Did you make those?

625
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,320
抱歉  我不是有意偷看的
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

626
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,110
这个吗  我最近瞎折腾的
Oh, this? I've been fooling around with it a little bit.

627
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,840
我能看看吗
Can I see?

628
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,490
萨拉在美工课上学折这种鸟
Sarah learned how to make these birds in her art class.

629
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,660
她又教会了凯文  他俩就着迷了
Then she taught it to Kevin, and they got obsessed,

630
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,710
家里到处都是小纸片
and there were little pieces of paper all over the apartment.

631
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,630
拿去给孩子们吧
Do you wanna take them for the kids?

632
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,670
不用了  我不能拿
Oh, no. I can't.

633
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,200
拿去吧  反正我最后也会丢掉
Oh, please. I'll just throw them out eventually.

634
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,030
谢谢  他们一定很喜欢
Thank you. They'll love them.

635
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,020
哪天带你的孩子来我家吧
So you should bring the kids by the house

636
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,100
让我见见他们
sometime so I can meet them.

637
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,600
凯文和弗兰克可以一起打电玩
Kevin and Frank can play the video games.

638
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,190
他告诉你的吗
He told you that?

639
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,080
必须承认  我当时有点惊讶
I was a little surprised, I have to admit.

640
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,500
如果有人知道他每天回家都...
If anybody knew he came home every day to...

641
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,570
-可太丢人了  -还有更可怕的秘密呢
- it's embarrassing. - There's worse secrets to have.

642
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,000
是啊  我想也是
Yeah, there are, I suppose.

643
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,640
我跟克雷伯恩和普莱斯谈过后
I'll call you Monday after I talk

644
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,480
周一会给你打电话
to Clayburn and Price.

645
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,360
好的  太棒了  周末愉快  彼得
Okay, great. Have a good weekend, Peter.

646
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,110
你也是
You too.

647
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,030
我让琳达跟副总统谈过了
I had Linda talk to the Vice President.

648
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,470
-他不会过问的  -太感谢了
- He'll keep his nose out of it. - I appreciate that.

649
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,480
他人挺好的
He's a good man,

650
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
但现在正是竞选的敏感时期
but this is a very delicate moment in the campaign.

651
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,620
有人提出质疑...
You start spreading doubts, and...

652
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,710
他就是个讨厌鬼  我们都知道
He's a pain in the ass. We all know it.

653
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,760
没必要拐弯抹角  弗兰克
You don't have to mince words, Frank.

654
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,400
不得不说  先生  副总统还是有道理的
I have to say, sir, the Vice President has a point.

655
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,340
我并不十分赞成罗素
I'm not 100% sold on Russo.

656
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,870
我们真的要选经验这么浅的人吗
Do we really wanna go with someone this untested?

657
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,550
弗兰克
Frank?

658
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,830
我们还在打磨他  先生
We're grooming him, sir.

659
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,160
-你什么时候宣布  -下个月
- When do you announce? - Next month.

660
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,520
-时间不够  -你看中他什么
- That's not enough time. - What do you see in him?

661
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,350
我也好奇  他没什么特别之处
I was wondering the same thing. There's not that much to see.

662
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,310
他是个曾经吸毒  正在戒酒的人
What I see is a recovering alcoholic with a history of drug abuse.

663
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,990
-什么  -你说什么  弗兰克
- What? - Excuse me, Frank?

664
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,390
他已经戒了  戒一年了
But he's clean now. Has been for a year.

665
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,730
这是一个救赎的故事  总统先生
This is a redemption story, Mr. President.

666
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,350
一个重回正轨的聪明的年轻人
This is a bright young man who's put his life back on track.

667
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,510
如今他还想帮宾州重回正轨
Now he wants to help put Pennsylvania back on track.

668
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,020
吸毒  弗兰克
Drugs, Frank?

669
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,660
人们喜欢失败者  琳达
People love an underdog, Linda,

670
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,610
人们喜欢看到浪子回头
and people love someone who stands up after they've fallen.

671
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,010
结合这两点  就是个有力的竞选主题
Combine those two, it's a very powerful narrative.

672
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,830
我们所有的民调都显示这会成功
All of our polling indicates this is gonna work.

673
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,700
你想让我们支持一个有药物滥用史的人
You want us to endorse someone with a history of substance abuse?

674
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,340
我们把故事讲给选民听
Let us get his story out there

675
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,850
然后看他们对此的反应
and watch it connect with the voters.

676
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,360
我只在乎胜利  弗兰克
All I care about is a win, Frank.

677
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,610
我认为罗素是我们的最佳选择
And I believe Russo is our best chance.

678
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,020
这不是听天由命  总统先生
This is not a hail Mary, Mr. President,

679
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,570
-这是缜密思考过的一步棋  -总统先生
- this is a well-thought-out game plan. - Mr. President...

680
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,430
我知道我有时会打破常规
I realize that I sometimes think out of the box,

681
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,730
但我上次这么做的时候
but the last time I did,

682
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,430
我们签署了一份教育法案
we signed an education bill.

683
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,450
好  我们不会反对
All right. We won't stand in your way.

684
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,100
但如果事与愿违  弗兰克
But if it backfires, Frank...

685
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,340
我会全程指导彼得
I'll guide Peter every step along the way.

686
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,470
我们不会让您失望  总统先生
We will not disappoint you, Mr. President.

687
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,690
好
Okay.

688
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,900
谢谢您  先生
Thank you, sir.

689
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,200
琳达
Linda.

690
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,710
我没打算这么快都告诉他
I didn't plan on telling him so much so soon,

691
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,480
但如果我不说  琳达会动摇他
but if I didn't, Linda would've swayed him.

692
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,830
打破疑虑最好的利器
There's no better way to overpower a trickle of doubt

693
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,830
莫过于赤裸裸的事实
than with a flood of naked truth.

694
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,040
所以说教育法案很重要
This is why the education bill was so important.

695
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,290
它在我最需要的时候给了我影响力
It bought me influence precisely when I needed it most.

696
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,490
你酒龄有多少年了
How long have you been drinking?

697
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,180
很多年  从我小的时候就开始了
A long time. Since I was a kid.

698
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,800
你第一次喝酒时几岁
How old were you when you had your first drink?

699
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,870
-9岁  -9岁
- Nine. - Nine years old?

700
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,080
没错  我爸在我9岁生日时给了我瓶啤酒
Yeah. My dad gave me a beer for my ninth birthday.

701
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,620
你开始吸毒是什么时候
When did you first start using drugs?

702
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,750
我不会说太细
I won't go into too many specifics

703
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,390
只能说  我过去曾吸食大麻
other than to say I had a few minor brushes

704
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,170
和可卡因  但次数很少
with marijuana and cocaine in the past but not recently,

705
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,750
近年内没有了
and only a handful of times.

706
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,340
除了大麻和可卡因没有其他毒品吗
No other drugs besides marijuana and cocaine?

707
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,960
没有
No.

708
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,180
都是些什么场合
Under what circumstances?

709
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,170
偶尔的社交聚会  不能再多说了
Occasional social gatherings. That's the most I'll say.

710
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,890
你任公职后吸过毒吗
Ever while you were in public office?

711
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,220
不  从没有过  我主要问题是酗酒
No. Never. My chief problem was alcohol.

712
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,010
你戒酒多长时间了
And you've been sober how long now?

713
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,700
-一年多一点  -你为什么戒酒
- A little over a year. - And what made you want to get sober?

714
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:50,110
两个原因  我的孩子们
Two things. My children,

715
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,430
我爱他们胜过一切
whom I love more than anything else in the world,

716
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,800
再就是对上帝重拾信念
and my renewed faith in God.

717
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,120
佐伊
Zoe.

718
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,760
卢卡斯
Lucas.

719
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,060
我凑巧在附近  我想
I was just in the neighborhood, and I thought...

720
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,970
不  那是撒谎  我在街角的酒吧
No. That's a lie. I was at the bar around the corner.

721
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,950
那间有
The one with the, uh...

722
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,760
我记起有次
and I remembered that time

723
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,310
我送你下班
that I dropped you off after work.

724
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,470
我记得
I knew it was...

725
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,140
是这个街区
This block.

726
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,760
我按了门铃  然后等着
And I, uh, buzzed, and then I waited...

727
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,350
-你喝多了  -我喝多了
- you're wasted. - I'm pretty wasted.

728
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,040
你想知道个大秘密吗
Do you wanna know a deep, dark secret?

729
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,170
现在我们已经不在一起
Now we don't work together...

730
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,990
工作了
anymore.

731
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,140
卢卡斯
Lucas...

732
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,480
我真是受宠若惊
I'm really flattered.

733
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,360
可是我现在
But I'm just not in a place

734
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,080
心思完全不在这方面上
where I'm even thinking romantically right now.

735
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,200
我很抱歉  我
I'm sorry. I, uh...

736
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,800
好吧
Yeah.

737
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,640
现在停过去吗  先生
You want me to pull up now, sir?

738
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,010
我还有钥匙
I still have my key.

739
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,940
如果你需要什么的话  我在厨房
I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything.

740
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,610
谢谢
Thank you.

741
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,990
我买了酒  但是找不到开瓶器
Hey, I got us wine, but I can't find a corkscrew anywhere.

742
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,950
给我
Give it to me.

743
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,550
我需要笔
I need a pen.

744
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,900
-总统给你的那支行吗  -可以
- The pen the President gave you? - That'll work.

745
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,910
你和斯克斯基小姐谈了吗
Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?

746
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,700
谈了  她说当时挺动情的
I did. She said it was intense.

747
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,000
我觉得卡莉会请她去头条网工作
I think Carly's gonna offer her a job at Slugline.

748
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,390
-是你推动的  -简宁也有兴趣
- Was that your doing? - Janine expressed interest.

749
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,740
我只是做了个顺水人情
I took the next step.

750
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,070
做的好  让别人欠你人情总是好事
Well done. Always good to be owed favors.

751
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,160
我之前在想  你介意我的年龄吗
I was wondering. Do you ever think about my age?

752
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,160
没有  你介意我的年龄吗
No. Does my age bother you?

753
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,030
你肯定有其他的情人  比我年轻的男人
You must have other lovers... men that are younger than me.

754
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,160
-没有  -我并不介意
- No. - Not that I would mind.

755
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,710
毕竟我已经结婚了
I am married, after all.

756
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,390
我没时间找其他情人
I don't have time for other lovers.

757
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,670
该死
Mm. Shit.

758
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,130
变质了  给我
It's turned. Give me that.

759
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,030
你可以直接踩死它
You could've just stepped on it.

760
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,530
我找过管理员让他找人除虫
I have asked the super to get an exterminator in here,

761
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,460
可他不肯
and he won't do it.

762
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,890
所以我每次看到蟑螂或蜘蛛什么的
So anytime I see a cockroach or a spider, or whatever,

763
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,610
我就抓住它们  然后放到他的门口
I try and trap it, and then I leave it by his door.

764
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,480
你真应该找你父母借点钱
You really ought to get your parents to let you borrow some money.

765
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,730
这样你就不用生活在第三世界了
Then you wouldn't have to live in the third world.

766
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,370
我绝不会拿他们的钱
I would never take money from them.

767
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,610
因为他们没有  还是你不想要
Because they don't have it, or because you don't want it.

768
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,980
我不想要
Because I don't want it.

769
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,080
今天是父亲节
It's father's day, you know.

770
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,690
是吗
It is?

771
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,240
你应该给你父亲打个电话
You should call your father.

772
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,990
我明天再打给他
I'll call him tomorrow.

773
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,270
明天你就是忘记父亲节的女儿
Tomorrow you'll be the daughter that forgot father's day

774
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,760
而不是记得这个日子的乖女儿
instead of the one who remembered.

775
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,370
去吧  给他打电话
Go ahead. Call him.

776
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,450
爸爸  抱歉这么晚打给你
Hey, dad. Sorry it's so late.

777
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,580
因为上次我打给她的时候你不在家
'Cause you weren't home the last time I called her.

778
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,130
我和她永远不会对彼此倾吐太多
There's so little she'll ever reveal to me or I to her.

779
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,140
我猜她父亲知道的更少
I bet her father knows even less.

780
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,160
她讲电话的声音肯定要高半个八度
I'm sure she's speaking half an octave higher.

781
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,640
就像她16岁时那样的声音
Same voice she had when she was 16.

782
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,230
跟他说她找到了新工作
Telling him all about her new job,

783
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,600
十分想他
how much she misses him,

784
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,890
很抱歉没给他寄张贺卡
and sorry she didn't send a card.

785
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,770
告诉他一切  唯独不说真话
Telling him everything but the truth.

786
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,120
就像她不告诉我刚才楼下的那个小伙子
Just like she wouldn't tell me about that young man downstairs.

787
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,660
我这不是给你打电话了吗
I'm calling now, all right?

788
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,510
别让我因为这个难受
Don't make me feel bad about it.

789
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,870
这是最好的结果
It was the best thing that could've happened.

790
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,200
我在那儿不合适
I didn't fit in there.

791
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,510
我听过更难听的话  爸爸
I've been called worse, dad.

792
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,750
保守秘密是有价值的
There's a value in having secrets.

793
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,720
像我  像克莱尔  像佐伊这样的人
Creatures like myself, like Claire, like Zoe...

794
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,730
没有秘密  我们就不是自己
we wouldn't be ourselves without them.

795
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,770
另一方面  彼得・罗素
But Peter Russo, on the other hand...

796
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,710
他被他的秘密所束缚
he's trapped by his secrets.

797
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,970
而我就是在给他一个重获自由的机会
What I'm trying to do is give him the opportunity to set himself free.

798
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,050
我不知道
I don't know.

799
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,520
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

800
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,020
毕竟  我们多少只是
After all, we are nothing more or less

801
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,650
我们选择表现出来的样子
than what we choose to reveal.

802
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,160
我在克莱尔和佐伊面前是不同的人
What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe,

803
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,580
就像佐伊在我和她爸爸面前也是不同的人
just as Zoe is not to me what she is to her father.

804
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,380
也许要到感恩节
Probably Thanksgiving.

805
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:58,850
在那之前我可能都回不去
'Cause I don't think I can make it back before then.

806
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,860
好吧  我尽量
Okay. I'll try.

807
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,470
我说了我尽量
I said I'll try.

808
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,270
圣诞节吗  不行
For Christmas. Uh... no.

809
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,870
没有  我现在没在谈恋爱
No. I'm not seeing anyone right now.

810
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,300
不想谈
I don't feel like it.

811
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,540
因为没兴趣
Because I'm not interested in that.

812
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,180
我会告诉你的  爸爸
I would tell you, dad.

813
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,220
是的
Yeah.

814
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,310
好的
Okay.

815
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,910
别担心我
Don't be worried about me.

816
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,670
我很好
I'm fine.

817
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,030
是的
Yeah.

818
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,260
爸爸  我
Dad, I'm in...

819
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,240
我现在过得很好
I'm in a really great place right now.

820
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,000
我尽量
I'm gonna try.

821
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,770
我尽量回去
I'm gonna try to come, okay?

822
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,840
父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day.

823
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,450
你不祝我父亲节快乐吗
Aren't you gonna wish me a happy Father's Day?

824
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,620
你又没有孩子
You don't have any children.

825
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,140
