1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,020
你干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,380
天哪
Jesus!

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,560
你看清肇事的车了吗
Did you get a good look?

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,670
只看到是辆蓝色丰田佳美
Blue Toyota Camry, it's all I saw.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,340
是沃顿家的狗
It's the Wharton's dog.

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,920
-天哪  -他撑不了多久了
- Oh, man. - He's not gonna make it.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,440
去看看他们在不在家
Go see if they're at home.

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,590
没事了
It's ok.

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,600
痛苦分两种
There are two kinds of pain.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,130
一种让你变得更强...
The sort of pain that makes you strong...

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,760
另一种毫无价值
or useless pain...

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,560
只是徒添折磨
The sort of pain that's only suffering.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,990
我对没价值的东西也没耐心
I have no patience for useless things.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,120
这种时刻  需要有人采取行动
Moments like this require someone who will act...

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,180
或做一些不好的事
or do the unpleasant thing,

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,410
但也是必要的事
or the necessary thing.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,710
好了...
There...

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,420
痛苦结束了
No more pain.

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,990
肇事逃逸  我很遗憾
It was a hit and run, I'm awfully sorry.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,050
他肯定又自己跳出了庭院
He must have jumped over the fence again.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,370
史蒂夫会就肇事车信息报案
Look, Steve's gonna file a report on the car,

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,380
他会派下属去处理
he'll put his people on it.

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,710
我们会找到那个司机的
We'll track him down.

24
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,740
你真是光彩照人
You're stunning.

25
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,380
我们走吧
Shall we?

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,460
三...二...一...
Three two...one...

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,000
新年快乐
Happy New Year!

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,130
当选总统  加勒特・沃克
Oh, President elected Garrett Walker.

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,450
我喜欢他吗  不
Do I like him? No.

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,460
我信任他吗  这不是重点
Do I believe in him? That's beside the point.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,720
任何一个能获得七千万选票的政客
Any politician that gets 70 million votes

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
他所象征的含义早已超过了自身
has tapped into something larger than himself,

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,290
当然也超过了我  尽管我不愿意承认
larger than even me as much as I hate to admit it.

34
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,220
看那胜者的笑脸  那些信任的眼神
Look at that winning smile, those trusting eyes.

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,120
我一早便抓住了他  并扮演了重要角色
I clung to him early on, and made myself vital.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,070
在国会待了22年
After 22 years in congress

37
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,340
我能嗅到风头的走向
I can smell which way the wind is going.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,520
吉姆・马修斯  尊敬的副总统阁下
Jim Matthews, his right honorably Vice-President.

39
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,440
前宾夕法尼亚州州长
Former Governor of Pennsylvania.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,760
他帮总统拿下了宾州
He did his duty in delivering the Keystone State.

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,830
上帝保佑他
Bless his heart.

42
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,650
现在他们想让他退休了
And now they're about to put him out to pasture.

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,740
但他看上去挺开心的  不是吗
But he looks happy, now doesn't he?

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,210
在有些人看来  就是椅子大点罢了
For some, it's simply the size of the chair.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,600
琳达・瓦斯奎兹  沃克的幕僚长
Linda Vasquez, Walker's chief of staff.

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,010
是我找来了她  她是个女人
I got her hired. She's a woman, check.

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,300
又是拉丁裔
And a Latina, check.

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,690
但更重要的是  她像一块廉价牛排一样坚韧
But more important than that, she's as tough as two-dollar steak.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,110
样样都符合标准
Check, check, check.

50
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,450
要入住白宫
When it comes to the White House,

51
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,770
你不仅要揣好钥匙
you not only need the keys in your back pocket.

52
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,320
还需要一个看门人
You need the gatekeeper.

53
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,340
而我  我只是卑微的众议院多数党党鞭
As for me, I'm just a lowly house majority whip.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,060
我维持这个被琐事
I keep things moving in a Congress

55
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,360
和倦怠堵塞的众议院的运转
choked by pettiness, and lassitude.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,670
我的工作就是疏通管道  让污泥流动
My job is to clear the pipes, and keep the sludge moving.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,330
但我这水管工要退休了  我尽了职责
But I won't have to be a plumber much longer. I've done my time.

58
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,120
我支持了对的人
I backed the right man.

59
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,280
付出与索取
Give and take.

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,310
这就是华盛顿
Welcome to Washington.

61
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,490
你该理发了
You need a haircut.

62
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,940
是吗
You think?

63
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,490
稍修剪一下
A little trim.

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,080
你准备穿什么
What are you gonna wear?

65
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,360
-去会面吗  -正式宣布的时候
- You mean for the meeting? - For the announcement.

66
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,400
我准备穿海军蓝  带细条纹的那套
I'm wearing my navy blue, the one with the pinstripes.

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,430
很好
Good.

68
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,290
那套西服很衬你
You look handsome in that suit.

69
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,350
难说他们会不会在你的董事会前宣布
I don't know if they will announce it before your board meeting.

70
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,650
只要这笔捐款保证能拿到就行
Well, as long as I can say the donation is coming.

71
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,740
一正式宣布  桑科公司就会给你支票
As soon as it's official, Sancorp will write you the check.

72
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,630
今年对我们将会是重要的一年
This is going to be a big year for us.

73
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,720
哪一个委员会
Community of what?

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,920
我猜是移民  银行或者教育  但是...
I would say immigration, banking or education, but...

75
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,350
但我常规的联络人都无法确认
None of my regular sources can confirm that.

76
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,300
那...
Because...

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,620
他们是不知道  还是不愿说
They don't know, or because they're not talking?

78
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
他们不知道
Because they don't know.

79
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,750
继续查  挖点东西出来
Keep at it, get me something.

80
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,630
对不起  真抱歉  汉默施密特先生
Sorry, I'm so sorry Mr. Hammerschmidt.

81
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,110
我是佐伊...
Zoe...

82
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,820
-巴恩斯  -嗯
- Barnes - Right.

83
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,510
他当年也过了一年才记住你是谁吗
Did it take him a year to remember your name?

84
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,510
不止
Longer.

85
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,260
早上好  卢卡斯
Good morning, Lucas.

86
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,540
有什么事吗  佐伊
What can I do for you, Zoe?

87
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,060
我受不了费尔法克斯的郡议会了
I am sick of the Fairfax county council.

88
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,470
-你每天都这么说  -让我做网络报道
- You tell me everyday. - Move me online.

89
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,600
让我开博客
My own blog.

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
第一人称  主观视角  五百字篇幅
First person, subjective, 500 words.

91
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,870
-没门  -我去挖掘秘密
- Not gonna happen. - I'll go underground.

92
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,690
幕后消息  甚至去翻夜壶
backrooms, the urinals!

93
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,490
去争取国会的人
I'll win over staff members on the Hill.

94
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,460
他们也需要发泄
They need a place to vent.

95
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,850
-八卦专栏  -不  是事实真相
- A gossip column? - No. We'll lift the veil.

96
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,350
现在到底怎么回事
What's really going on.

97
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,900
这里是《华盛顿先驱报》  佐伊  
This is the Washington Herald, Zoe.

98
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,460
不是...名人消息网  
 It's not...TMZ.

99
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,230
你知道有多少人浏览名人消息网吗
Do you know how many people who watch TMZ?

100
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,130
我一点也不关心
I couldn't care less.

101
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
所以报刊新闻业在衰落
Which is why print journalism is dying.

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,300
那也不失体面  至少这份报纸是如此
Then it will die with dignity. At least with this paper.

103
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,220
你还活在20世纪吧  卢卡斯  
You are stuck in the 20th century, Lucas,

104
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,550
缺乏想象力
you lack imagination.

105
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,910
也许吧  但我现在不需要想象力  
Maybe so, but right now I don't need imagination,

106
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,240
我需要报道
I need copy.

107
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,740
你自己的时间随意支配
Your nights and weekends are yours,

108
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,400
你想做什么我都没意见
I applaud whatever you want to do,

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,710
但不能占用工作时间
as long as its not on my time.

110
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,770
-你是让我去干活儿吗  -没错
- You're telling me to go back to work? - I am.

111
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,650
但你实际上是叫我滚蛋
What you're really telling me is to fuck off.

112
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,980
两者都有
I'm telling you both.

113
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,180
普罗旺斯基金的查普曼先生在等你
It's Mr. Chapman already, from Provence Trust.

114
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,270
不要接进电话  克里斯蒂娜
Hold my calls, Christina.

115
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,630
亨利
Henry.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,630
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

117
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,550
-到这儿几天了  -今天刚来
- How long are you in town for? - Just today.

118
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,910
那你一定得来看就职典礼
What? You gotta come back down for the inauguration.

119
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,250
我可以帮你联系一下
I can hook you up.

120
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,150
不如帮我联系一下
How about you hook me up with

121
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,460
你答应会修改的分区法吧
the zoning laws you promised to get changed?

122
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,070
为了一块不能建房的空地
We got 12 millions sitting in escrow

123
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,830
我们一千二百万被托管
for an empty lot we can't build on.

124
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,940
我知道  但你要明白
I know, but you gotta understand...

125
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,740
这是地方政府的问题  
It's a local municipal issue.

126
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,970
我不能随便打个电话就...
I can't just pick up the phone...

127
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,770
你不能了吗
You can't?

128
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,320
你求我们捐款五万的时候
Because that's not what you lead us to believe

129
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,340
可不是这么说的
when you begged for 50 grand in donations.

130
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,370
嗯  我
Right, I...

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,250
稍等片刻
Just one second.

132
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,670
克里斯蒂娜  我说了不要转接
Christina, I said no calls,

133
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,510
我和查普曼先生会面时不接电话
not while I'm meeting with Mr. Chapman.

134
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,520
当选总统
The President-elect?

135
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,590
-你不介意吧  -不  接吧
- Do you mind? - No, go ahead please.

136
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,250
把电话接进来  克里斯蒂娜
Put him trough Christina.

137
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,530
当选总统先生
Mr. President-elect?

138
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,030
谢谢  
Thank you.

139
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,520
是的  我们很高兴以两位数优势胜出
Yes, we were pleased to win by double digits.

140
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,630
当然  乐意效劳
Absolutely, anything you need.

141
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,220
我需要你把你湿长灵活的舌头
I need you to put your long, wet, talented tongue

142
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,710
伸入我两腿之间
between my tights

143
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,610
让我像莫妮卡・莱温斯基那样尖...
and make me squeal like Monica Lewin...

144
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,670
我也是
Me too.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,950
我也是
Me too.

146
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
好的  谢谢您  先生
Okay, thank you, sir.

147
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,360
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry...

148
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,250
刚才说到哪了
where were we?

149
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,120
沃克
Walker...

150
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,120
他什么样
what's he like?

151
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,450
当选总统迟到了吗
The President-elect running late?

152
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,950
不  他来不了  我会跟他汇报的
No, he couldn't make it. I'll brief him, though.

153
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,580
好的
Okay.

154
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,220
这是我起草的备忘录
This is the memo, I've drafted,

155
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,170
关于我们在商讨的中东政策
on our Middle East policy we've been developing.

156
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,570
我想借用里根的说法
Now, I want to borrow from Reagan.

157
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,790
造个新词  叫"滴入式外交"
I'd like to coin the phrase "Trickle-down diplomacy".

158
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,300
-这样  -弗兰克  我得打断你
- That way... - Frank. I'm gonna stop you there.

159
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,820
我们不打算提名你为国务卿
We are not nominating you for the Secretary of State.

160
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,480
我知道他向你承诺过  
I know, he made you a promise,

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,380
但现在情况有变
but circumstances have changed.

162
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,930
所谓承诺  琳达
The nature of promises, Linda,

163
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,110
就是不论情况如何变化也不受影响
is that they remain immune to changing cicumstances.

164
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,730
加勒特已经深思熟虑过了
Garrett has thought long and hard about this.

165
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,750
他认为我们需要你留在国会
And he's decided we need you to stay in Congress.

166
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,070
这是什么时候的决定
When was this decision made?

167
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,180
为什么我没参与商讨
And why wasn't I part of a conversation?

168
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,540
我很抱歉  弗兰克  如果由我决定
I'm sorry, Frank, if it been up to me,

169
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,130
我也不会等到现在才告诉你
I wouldn't have waited this long to tell you.

170
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,570
那你早就知道要这么做
So you knew, you were going to do this.

171
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,900
我们的确谈了很久
It has been an evolving discussion.

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,060
这就是懦夫的做法
It's a chicken-shit move.

173
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,380
-弗兰克  -我都做过审查了
- Frank... - I was vetted.

174
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,640
-那都是晃我吗  -不是的
- Was that a ruse? - No.

175
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,210
我们打开天窗说亮话
Let's be absolutely clear,

176
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,710
没有我  你们赢不了
you wouldn't have won without me.

177
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,810
你说的没错  但我们现在执政了
You're right, but now we have to lead.

178
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,560
所以得做出艰难的决定
And that means making tough choices.

179
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,310
你知道  教育是我们的重中之重
As you know, education is a top priority for us.

180
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,830
要进行彻底的改革
A complete federal overhaul.

181
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,260
但不仅仅是教育  弗兰克  
But it's not just the education, Frank,

182
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,510
国会已经分裂了
Congress has split.

183
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,980
我们更需要你待在国会  而不是国务院
We need you there, more than we need you in the State Department.

184
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,210
是我找你来的  琳达
I got you hired, Linda.

185
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,300
我知道  
I know.

186
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,870
捐款  博取公开支持
Donations, endorsements.

187
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,530
我为竞选写了整套外交纲领
I wrote the campaign's entire foreign policy platform.

188
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,730
我把外事委员会多年来...
I bring years of Foreign Affairs Committee...

189
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,670
弗兰克
Frank.

190
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,830
请别这样
Please.

191
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,230
我要单独和沃克谈
I want to speak to Walker personally.

192
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,110
已经决定了
The decision is made.

193
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,980
我们需要你  弗兰克
We need you, Frank.

194
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,440
你会支持我们吗
Will you stand beside us or not?

195
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,310
当然了  如果这是总统所愿
Of course, if that's what the President wants.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,610
很高兴听到这话
I'm very glad to hear that.

197
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,930
我很好奇
I'm curious.

198
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,990
你们选了谁
If not me then who?

199
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,860
迈克尔・科恩
Michael Kern.

200
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,040
迈克尔・科恩
Michael Kern?

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,200
嗯
Well...

202
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,100
真是绝妙的选择
that is an excellent choice.

203
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,830
净水计划

204
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,650
这样清楚吗
Do you think it'll look clear?

205
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,150
我可不想让这看着像
I just want to make sure it doesn't look like

206
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,860
我们在忽略国内...
we're neglecting out domestic...

207
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,820
不不不  我会说
No, no, no, no... I'm gonna say

208
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,030
-我们在拓展业务  -好的
- that we are expanding our mission. - Okay.

209
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,160
我们会启用新的组织帮助我们
And we're bringing on a new organization to help us.

210
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,320
决定好用哪家了吗
They know which one yet?

211
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,110
我还在定夺  但是
I'm still looking into a few options, but, um...

212
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,340
我们之前说定要招几个新人
Tell me, what did we agree on that we could hire how many new people.

213
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,260
-六个吗  -六七个吧
- Six? - Six, maybe seven.

214
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,880
人手足够的
We'll have enough.

215
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,230
真激动人心啊
Ooh, it's exciting. Huh?

216
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,410
向着新方向前进
This, uh, new direction we're heading.

217
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,120
我只是不知道要怎么安置那些人
I just don't know where we're gonna fit all the people.

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,010
你觉得我们地方不够用吗
Well, do you think we'll have to look into additional space?

219
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,950
不不  我会想办法
No, no. I'll find a way.

220
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,690
好  去修改PPT
Okay, so make the changes to the power point.

221
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,250
-两点半开会  -好的
- And let's meet again, at 2:30. - Okay.

222
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,910
是我
It's me.

223
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,330
我像傻子一样给你留言  打给我
I feel like an idiot leaving messages like this. Call me back.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,360
什么事  佐伊
What is it, Zoe?

225
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,140
我知道你在白宫会很忙  所以
Um, I knew you're gonna have your hands full at the White House. So,...

226
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,640
如果你需要谁来做调查  或者
If you need someone to do research, or...

227
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,290
-写背景资料  -我没问题
- Or punch out background. - I think I'll be fine.

228
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,910
如果实在忙不过来  需要帮助的话...
Well, if things get hectic, and you need any help...

229
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,300
你好写博客说跟大人物打过交道了吗
So you can blog about rubbing shoulders with the big boys.

230
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,760
卢卡斯跟你说了什么
Wh... What did Lucas tell you?

231
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,020
无意冒犯  佐伊
Look, no offence, Zoey,

232
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,520
但我没时间教菜鸟
But I don't have time to be anyone's training wheels.

233
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,690
我只是想
I just thought...

234
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,280
我只想帮帮你
No, I was just actually offering to lend a hand.

235
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,430
-仅此而已  -知道了
- That's it. - I got it.

236
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,680
谢谢
Thanks.

237
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,550
克莱尔  你在哪

238
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,170
-卡莱尔  -你没打电话
- Claire. - You didn't call.

239
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,220
-我...  -你没打电话  弗兰西斯
- I was... - You didn't call me, Francis.

240
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,110
九小时  没一个电话
Nine hours, you don't not call me.

241
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,770
这可是天大的事
Not when it's this big.

242
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,820
是的
You're right.

243
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,550
我们什么时候逃避过对方了
When have we ever avoided each other?

244
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,920
我想先想个办法出来
I wanted a solution first.

245
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,820
-想到了吗  -还没有
- Do you have one? - Not yet.

246
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,610
这对我也有影响  弗兰西斯
This affects me too, Francis.

247
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,420
我不是为钱的事生气
And it's not the money I'm upset about.

248
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,950
而是我们该共同面对
It's that we do things together.

249
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,830
你不告诉我  我们就完了
When you don't involve me we are in free fall.

250
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,140
我该打给你的  可我没有
I should have called you and I didn't.

251
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,660
发生了什么
What Happened?

252
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,660
她说他们得把我留在议会
She says they needed to keep me in Congress.

253
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,250
-琳达说的吗  -沃克都没在场
- Linda said that? - Walker wasn't even there.

254
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,170
这是最让我生气的
That's what really get's me,

255
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,450
他都没胆直视我的眼睛
he didn't even have the courage to look me in the eye.

256
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,920
你不该信任那女人的
I knew you shouldn't trust that women.

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,760
我不信任她  我不信任任何人
I didn't. I don't. I don't trust any one.

258
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,390
那你怎么没预料到呢
Then how could you not see this coming.

259
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,140
我没想到他们敢这么做
I never thought they were capable.

260
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,080
你很少低估别人啊  弗兰西斯
You don't usually underestimate people, Francis.

261
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,170
我知道
I know.

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,890
狂妄
Hubris...

263
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,250
-野心  -你该觉得愤怒
- Ambition ... - You should be angry.

264
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,020
-我都气疯了  -那我怎么不觉得
- I am livid. - Then where is that I don't see it.

265
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,090
你想让我怎样  大吼大叫吗
What do you want me to do, scream and yell?

266
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,000
-大发脾气吗  -我想看你有所表现
- Throw a temper? - I want more than I'm seeing.

267
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,180
你不止这点出息  弗兰西斯
You're better than this, Francis.

268
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,520
我很抱歉  克莱尔  很抱歉
Well, I'm sorry, Claire. I am sorry.

269
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,450
不  我不接受
No, that I won't accept.

270
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,550
-什么  -道歉
- What? - Apologies.

271
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,670
我丈夫从不道歉
My husband doesn't apologizes.

272
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,280
即便对我
Even to me.

273
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,290
你起来多久了
How long have you been up?

274
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,430
好几个小时
Hours.

275
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,280
我知道该怎么做
I know what I have to do.

276
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
很好
Good.

277
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,390
我们将度过很多这样的夜晚
We'll have a lot of nights like this.

278
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,490
制定计划
Making plans.

279
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,640
没时间睡觉
Very little sleep.

280
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,490
这我知道
I expected that.

281
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,090
我不担心这个
It doesn't worry me.

282
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,320
我得去忙了
I'd better get to work.

283
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,650
我在楼上给你准备了一套西服
I laid a suit out for you upstairs.

284
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,370
海军蓝那套
The navy blue one.

285
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,780
我爱那个女人
I love that woman.

286
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,290
甚于鲨鱼爱鲜血
I love her more than sharks love blood.

287
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,370
当选总统加勒特・沃克
The President-elect Garrett Walker...

288
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,990
沃克提名科罗拉多资浅参议员科恩入主国务院

289
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,800
你说他们为什么选他
Why do you think they went with him?

290
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,410
我们太好了  他们需要我们在国会的支持
We are too good, they can't afford to lose us in Congress.

291
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,130
他整过容
He's had work done.

292
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,850
可能收过下巴  头发绝对是染的
Chin tuck probably. Definitely dyes his hair.

293
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,980
-我们要说什么吗  -千万别
- Do we say anything? - No. God no.

294
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,280
-除非他提起来  -南茜
- Not unless he brings it up. - Nancy?

295
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,310
-9点20分  -全都取消  斯坦普你进来
- 9:20... - Cancel everything. Stanford, you're with me.

296
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,470
听着
Now, look...

297
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,840
他们帮了我们一个大忙  道格 
They've done us a great favor, Doug.

298
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,100
我们不必再忠于他们  不效忠任何人
We are no longer bond by allegiances. We serve no one.

299
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,450
今后我们只有一条准则
We live by one rule, and one rule only

300
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,210
绝不再陷入如此境地
never again will we allow ourselves to be put in such a position.

301
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,990
沃克和瓦斯奎兹
Walker and Vasquez?

302
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,540
所有人  他们都跑不了
All of them. I hold them all accountable.

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,320
-报复吗  -不  不对
- Retribution? - No, no!

304
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,120
不止
It's more than that.

305
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,800
退后一步
Take a step back.

306
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,600
统观全局
Look at the bigger picture.

307
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,070
我明白你什么意思了
I can see what you're getting at.

308
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,500
先拿科恩开刀
Kern first?

309
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,560
吞噬鲸鱼就要这样  道格
That's how you devour a whale, Doug.

310
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,300
一口一口来
One bite at a time.

311
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,430
你想要谁
Who would you want?

312
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,970
-做国务卿  -给我列个候选人表
- For Secretary of State. - Give me a list of choices.

313
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,540
不管我们打算怎么做  得找个中间人
And, however we do this, we'll also need a buffer.

314
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,430
找个傀儡吗
You mean an errand boy?

315
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,310
是的  一个完全受我们控制的人
Yes, someone we control completely.

316
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,230
-好  我会留意的  -好
- Okay. I'll keep my ear to the ground. - Good.

317
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,580
我一天没吃东西了
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

318
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,540
我都快不忍心了
I almost pity him.

319
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,930
他也不想做我的盘中肉
He didn't choose to be put on my platter.

320
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,860
等到我把他剁碎了喂狗
When I carve him up and toss him to the dogs,

321
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,900
他才会承认那残忍的不可避免的真相
only then will he confront that brutal inescapable truth.

322
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,720
上帝啊
My God!

323
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,240
原来我不过是一盘猪肠
All I ever amounted to is chitterlings..

324
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,240
自卑的必升为高
"And he that shall humble himself, shall be exalted."

325
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,800
马太福音  第23章  第12节
Matthew, Chapter 23 verse 12.

326
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,990
感谢上帝
Thanks be to God.

327
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,480
今天我想讲的是
I'd like to speak today on the subject of

328
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,850
谦逊
humility.

329
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,990
你们大部分人刚刚赢得了改选
Well, a lot of you have just won re-election.

330
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,680
否则  大概也不会坐在这儿了
If you hadn't, you might not be sitting here.

331
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,010
我们当然应该享受成功并心怀感激
And of course we should enjoy our success and be grateful for it.

332
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,450
但千万不要让感激变为
But never let your gratitude sour into

333
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,820
骄傲
pride.

334
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,640
接下来的几年  你们会面对很多挑战
You will have many challenges ahead over the next couple of years.

335
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,650
一个人的品行
And a person's character

336
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,540
不取决于这人如何享受胜利
isn't determined by how he or she enjoys vitory

337
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,650
而在于这人如何忍受失败
but rather how he or she endures defeat.

338
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:47,690
没什么比信仰更能支撑我们度过艰难时光了
Nothing can help us endure dark times better than our faith.

339
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,060
克莱尔
Claire.

340
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,650
-你好  费莉希蒂  -你好吗
- Hello, Felicity. - How are you?

341
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,710
-很好  你呢  -很好
- Good, how are you ? - Good.

342
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,650
我很遗憾  这根本就没道理
I'm sorry, it's just not right.

343
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,670
我和查尔斯根本无法理解沃克是怎么想的
Charles and I can't understand what Walker was thinking.

344
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,220
你真是太贴心了
Oh, that's very sweet.

345
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,730
可是实事上  只跟你说
But, really, between you and me,

346
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,190
我觉得弗兰西斯如释重负
I think Francis is relieved.

347
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,910
他在国会更如鱼得水
He just feels much more at home in Congress.

348
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,770
在这之前  我敢压一百万赌他们选你
I would've bet a million dollars they were gonna pick you.

349
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,700
幸好你不差这一百万
Well, it's good thing you have a million dollars to spare.

350
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,230
但你显然是唯一人选啊
But you are by far and away the only choice.

351
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,490
谢谢你这么说
I appreciate you saying that.

352
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,150
迈克尔只有一半的经验...
I mean, Michael? Come on, he's got half the experience...

353
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,010
加勒特是个聪明人  他心里有数
Garrett is a smart man, he knows what he's doing.

354
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,850
弗兰克  你可比我强
You're a better man than I, Frank.

355
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,720
你
You...

356
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,820
想要点红酒吗
You want some of that wine?

357
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,870
好啊  当然
Yes, definitely.

358
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,050
这酒还真不错  你哪弄来的
Man this is some good shit, where did you get it?

359
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,880
我其实是
I kinda lifted it...

360
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,920
从议长节日派对的贵宾室偷的
from the VIP room of the speaker's holiday party.

361
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,440
真了不起
I'm impressed.

362
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,130
波尔多20年陈酿
Bordeaux twenty years old?

363
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,740
这酒和你很般配
It seemed about right for you.

364
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,520
-这话什么意思  -我快30了
- Why would you say that to me? - I'm almost thirty.

365
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,950
就你而言算很老了
Pratically ancient in your book.

366
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,540
我不介意年龄啊
I don't discriminate when it comes to age.

367
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,460
是吗  你什么时候雇过40岁的员工
Really? When was the last time you hired a 40 years old staffer?

368
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,190
-不代表我不会雇  -只要她床技了得
- Doesn't mean I wouldn't. - As long as she's good in the sack.

369
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,780
-拜托  -我说错了吗
- Come on. - That's true, isn't it?

370
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,920
你这是唱的哪一出
Where is this coming from?

371
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,750
你不会为哪个刚从瓦萨学院毕业的小骚货
You are not gonna just toss me aside for some sluts

372
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,400
把我扔一边吧
straight out of Vassar?

373
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,350
原来是为这个
So we're having that conversation.

374
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,170
已经六个月了  不再是玩玩而已了
It's been six month. It's not a little office fling any more.

375
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,700
你想让我说那三个有魔力的字
You want me to say those three magic words.

376
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,450
其中一个还以L开头
One of which starts with an L.

377
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,850
-不是  -好吧
- No. - Okay.

378
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,190
我要说了
I'll say it.

379
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,860
克里斯蒂娜・盖拉格
Christina Gallagher,

380
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,710
舔我蛋
lick my balls.

381
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,940
你个混蛋
You're a bastard!

382
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,470
我爱你
I love you.

383
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,110
我爱你  克里斯蒂娜
I love you, Christina.

384
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,470
我也爱你
I love you.

385
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,260
现在能舔我的蛋了吗
Now will you lick my balls?

386
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,010
我想知道
So I'm curious,

387
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,030
我们算资助人  捐助者还是讨厌鬼
are we patrons, benefactors or lepers?

388
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,040
不管你信不信  我们是天使
Believe it not, we're angels.

389
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,700
我要出去假装打电话
I'm gonna go outside and pretend to use my cell phone.

390
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
去吧
Go.

391
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,150
国家表演艺术中心

392
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
我能借你的外套吗
Could I have your jacket?

393
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,040
你要来睡觉吗
Are you coming to bed?

394
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,420
我一会儿就上去
I'll be up in a bit.

395
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,130
-别熬通宵了  -不会  我马上就去
- Don't stay up all night. - No, I'll be right there.

396
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,480
非常感谢  回头给你打电话
Thanks so much. I'll call you.

397
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,930
等等  你玩得不开心吗
Wait... I thought you had a good time?

398
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,440
开心  我很喜欢  我从没去过那儿
Oh I did, I loved it. I've never been before.

399
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,970
或许我能上去坐坐
Well, maybe I could come up.

400
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,830
布莱恩  你人真好
Brian, you're so sweet, really.

401
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,440
但如果我要上你  你会知道的
But if I was gonna fuck you, you'd know.

402
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,440
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

403
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,980
想要别人瞧得起你  就别只穿条丁字裤

404
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,300
国会议员弗兰西斯・安德伍德  众议院多数党党鞭

405
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,530
我看他挺严肃的

406
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,750
-她来了  -让她进来
- She's here. - Send her in.

407
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,310
总统的幕僚长可极少亲临国会
It's quite rare for a president's chief of staff to climb the Hill.

408
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,970
无疑是表示尊重
A gesture of respect no doubt,

409
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,520
或者是出于绝望
or desperation.

410
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,930
我猜她会提名唐纳德・布莱斯负责教育改革
I'm guessing she'll say Donald Blythe for education.

411
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,690
看看我说的对不对
Let's see if I'm right.

412
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,120
早上好  琳达
Good morning, Linda.

413
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,350
非常感谢你走这一趟
Thank you so much for making the trip up.

414
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,040
不客气
Of course, my pleasure.

415
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,590
教育
Education.

416
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,990
先说重要的
First things first,

417
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,370
这是就职典礼的座位图
the seating chart for the inauguration.

418
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,660
你和克莱尔坐这儿怎么样
How do these two work for you and Claire?

419
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,380
还附赠杰弗逊舞会的入场券
They come with a complimentary set of tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

420
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,110
克莱尔会非常高兴的
Claire would be over the moon.

421
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,630
那真是太好了
Good, I'm so glad.

422
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,900
那么  教育改革
So... education.

423
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,590
我们让唐纳德・布莱斯拟草案
We have Donald Blythe drafting the legislation.

424
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,120
唐纳德・布莱斯  天啊
Donald Blythe? Jesus.

425
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,210
我知道
I know.

426
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,230
你想要个比马克思还左的法案吗
So you want a bill just two steps left of Karl Marx.

427
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,310
我向当选总统提过反对意见
I advised the President-elect against it,

428
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,620
但唐纳德是教育界代表人物
but Donald is the face of education.

429
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,720
他为促成改革奋斗25年了
He's been pushing reforms for 25 years.

430
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
你想让我把他往中间引
You want me to guide him to the middle?

431
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,490
我们需要一部能通过的法案
We need a bill we can pass.

432
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,110
我在这事上有绝对自主权和决定权吗
Do I have absolute autonomy and authority on this?

433
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,260
不止如此
There's more.

434
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,640
加勒特想在就职百天内对法案进行投票
Garrett wants the bill on the floor in the first 100 days.

435
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,800
他想在就职演说中做出承诺
He wants to make a pledge in his inaugural address.

436
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,450
那...
Ah, that's...

437
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,210
真是非常有雄心  琳达
That's very ambitious, Linda.

438
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,160
我们能做出承诺吗
Can we make that pledge?

439
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
一百天吗
A hundred days?

440
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,670
我可以实现
I can deliver.

441
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,420
保持联系
Keep me posted.

442
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,880
我会找唐纳德谈  这周晚些时候和你联系
I'll talk with Donald, I'll check in with you later in the week.

443
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,950
好极了
Terrific.

444
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,280
你闻到了吗
Did you smell that?

445
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,170
装模作样  假意顺从
The smugness? The false deference.

446
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,430
她以为两张票就能收买我
She thinks I can be bought with a pair of tickets.

447
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,850
我是个战后柏林的妓女吗
What am I a whore in post-war Berlin

448
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,790
眼馋那点免费长袜和巧克力
salivating over free stocking and chocolate?

449
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,800
她想要的东西  代价要高得多
What she's asking will cost far more than that.

450
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,130
-费格森  -太老了
- Ferguson. - Too old.

451
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,620
-威利斯  -太蠢了
- Willis? - Too stupid.

452
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,680
-博伊德  -太基了
- Boyd. - Too queer.

453
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,800
不是吧
Really?

454
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,770
他都结婚  育有三子了
He's married with three kids.

455
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,250
他们肯定要伤心死了
And wouldn't they be devastated.

456
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,340
好吧
All right.

457
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,540
凯瑟琳・杜兰特呢
What about Catherine Durant?

458
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,950
凯茜・杜兰特
Cathy Durant ...

459
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,280
她曾公开反沃克
She was vocally anti Walker.

460
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,830
她有经验
She's got the experience.

461
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,670
替我安排会面
Set up a meeting.

462
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,330
桑科公司的捐款
The donation from Sancorp...

463
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,200
那笔钱得另想办法了
The money will have to come from somewhere else.

464
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,210
天哪  怎么回事
God, what happened?

465
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,390
我看了13年的预算
I've looked over the budget for fiscal 13

466
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,820
其中160万是员工工资
and we've allocated 1.6 million for salaries.

467
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,480
我们要把这项支出减半
We need to cut that in half.

468
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,800
-什么  你是说  -伊芙琳
- What, you're suggesting... - Evelyn,

469
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,140
我们要裁员
we're going to let some people go.

470
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,030
裁掉一半吗
That would be half of our staff?

471
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,880
我们必须腾出些位置
We have to carve out some room.

472
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,900
但这样就得裁掉些从一开始
But you'll have to fire some essential people

473
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,650
就跟着我们的老员工啊
who have been with us since the beginning.

474
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,070
我们是慈善机构
We are a charity,

475
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,180
但不服务于职员
but not for our employees.

476
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,680
克莱尔  要知道一直以来
You know, um, Claire, I have held my tongue

477
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,580
我没对国际化的事发表意见
about this whole international thing for a while.

478
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,980
但我想不通
But, I don't get it.

479
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,960
为什么要放弃现有熟悉的业务
I mean, we're really good at what we do,

480
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,330
转而做一些我们不在行的事情呢
why do we have to try and be something we're not?

481
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,980
因为发展到了瓶颈  伊芙琳
Because we've plateaued, Evelyn,

482
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,880
这个机构  现在应当...
and it is time for us, for our entire organisation...

483
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,240
去非洲挖井吗  我们对此一无所知
But digging wells in Africa? We don't know anything about that.

484
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,420
因此我们需要雇佣新员工
Which is why we have to bring in new people.

485
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,450
这是我向董事会提出的规划
This is the plan that I've proposed to the Board

486
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,550
董事会也接受了
and we are moving forward with it.

487
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,980
记得给我名单
I'd like a list of names, please.

488
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,790
克莱尔  不能再斟酌一下吗
Claire, can we just think about this?

489
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,600
我已经想过了
I have thought about it.

490
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,170
这是斟酌再三的结果
I've put a lot of thought into it.

491
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,330
-但是我觉得我们真的  -伊芙琳
- Yeah, but I think that we can really... - Evelyn ...

492
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,260
你是办公室主任
You are the office manager.

493
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,010
你得相信  我心里有数
I need you to trust that I know what I'm doing.

494
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,850
所以  请尽快给我那份名单
So please, get me that list, as soon as possible.

495
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,460
-女士  您不能  -抱歉
- Oh, ma'am. You can't go... - I'm sorry, I just ...

496
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,010
-我只有一个问题  -不行
- I just have one question... - No.

497
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,350
先生  抱歉  这位女士
Sir, I apologize this woman...

498
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,750
-议员  -小姐  请您退后
- Congressman. - Miss you need to step away from him.

499
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,870
-我只打扰一会  -请退后
- If I could just have one second. - You step away from the...

500
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,380
你是谁
Who are you?

501
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,980
我是佐伊・巴恩斯  《华盛顿先驱报》记者
My name is Zoe Barnes, I'm a reporter at the Washington Herald.

502
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,850
现在已经过了晚上十点半  而且这是我家
It is after 10:30 at night and this is my home.

503
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,660
我不允许任何...
I do not allow any...

504
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,690
你我彼此欣赏
We are part of a mutual admiration society.

505
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,390
你喜欢交响乐
You're a fan of the symphony.

506
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,870
比起音乐  更喜欢观众
One more for the people watching than the music.

507
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,980
没事了  史蒂夫  巴恩斯小姐  请进
It's all right, Steve. Come on in, Miss Barnes.

508
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,340
这酒很烈
It's strong.

509
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,020
你想要淡一些的
You prefer weak?

510
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,420
不  越烈越好
No, the stronger the better.

511
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,400
看看没什么
There's no harm in looking.

512
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,290
低级的把戏
It's a cheap ploy.

513
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,330
低级却有效
It's cheap but effective.

514
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,130
我洗耳恭听
Well, you certainly have my undivided attention.

515
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,210
好  我来这里的原因
Good. The reason I'm here...

516
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,790
前戏这就结束了
Oh, is foreplay over?

517
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,630
我听说肯尼迪撑不过3分钟
I read somewhere that JFK never lasted more than three minutes.

518
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,000
所以呢
The point been?

519
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,720
时间很宝贵
Time is precious.

520
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,440
身居高位之人无暇前戏
Powerful people don't have the luxury of foreplay.

521
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,890
那说说你的目的吧  巴恩斯小姐
Okay, so why are you here, Ms. Barnes?

522
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,750
我要找能说话的人
I need somebody I can talk to.

523
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,960
我们就在说话  你想说点什么
We're talking. Tell me what we're talking about.

524
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,020
我会为你保密  你说什么我都发表
I protect your identity. I print whatever you tell me.

525
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,930
而且绝不乱问问题
And I'll never ask any questions.

526
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,830
那你凭什么认定
And what makes you think

527
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,560
我没有和你的同行
I don't already have such an arrangement

528
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,660
达成了类似协议呢
with one of your colleague.

529
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,880
那样你就不会让我进门
Because if you did, you wouldn't have let me through the door.

530
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,290
在我漫长  成功的事业里
I've led a very long, very successful career

531
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,670
我一直避免与媒体打这种交道
avoiding this sort of intrigue with the press.

532
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,830
我现在也没觉得有什么好处
I can't see any advantage in starting now...

533
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,960
-那有什么坏处呢  -至少不谨慎
- But is there any disadvantage? - Sloppiness, for one.

534
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,080
我会绝对谨慎小心的
I promise you absolute discretion.

535
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,850
那就涉及到信任了
So, we're talking about trust.

536
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,440
随便你怎么说
Use whatever words you like.

537
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,610
怎么说很重要  巴恩斯小姐
Words matter very much, Ms. Barnes.

538
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,240
做你这行  对措词更当注意
You should care more about them, given your profession.

539
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,550
那么  是的
Then, yes...

540
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,170
我想获得你的信任
Your trust.

541
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,910
那我要信任哪个佐伊・巴恩斯呢
So, which Zoey Barnes am I to trust?

542
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,420
报道消防员娶开停车罚单女警的记者
The one who wrote about the fireman that married the meter maid?

543
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,940
还是那篇格外精彩的
Or the one who authored a very fine article

544
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,720
石溪公园新慢跑路线的作者
on a new jogging path in Rockcreek Park?

545
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,620
别太得意  我什么都读
Don't be flattered, I read everything.

546
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,870
我能写的远超过他们让我写的
I'm better than what they have me doing.

547
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,100
你也深有体会
You know what that feels like.

548
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,120
是吗
Do I?

549
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,980
如果你当选国务卿  一定能做得很好
You would've made a great Secretary of State.

550
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,870
你到底想问什么  巴恩斯小姐
How exactly may I help you, Miss Barnes?

551
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,630
你一定知道新政府的立法议程
You must know the administration legislative agenda.

552
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,700
-第一项是什么  -我可能知道
- What's coming up first? - I may.

553
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,770
-可以告诉我吗  -你觉得是什么
- Will you tell me? - What would be your guess?

554
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,210
-教育  -为什么
- Education. - Why?

555
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,560
移民问题争议太大
Immigration is too controversial,

556
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,680
税收改革不够劲爆
a tax reform isn't sexy enough.

557
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,430
关于孩子的能得到所有人支持
Everyone can get behind children.

558
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,240
-是教育吗  -怎么想是你的自由
- Is it education? - You might very well think that

559
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,280
我不能发表意见
I couldn't possibly comment.

560
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,420
给个提示吧
A hint.

561
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,460
很晚了  巴恩斯小姐
It's late, Miss Barnes.

562
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,280
我们还能再见吗
Can we talk again?

563
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,420
请你谅解  但这些事我得想想
I hope you'll understand that I want to sleep on all of this.

564
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,380
我从不在深更半夜
I never make such big decision so long after sunset

565
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,210
做重大决定
and so far from dawn.

566
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,180
我手机号在背面
My cell phone's on the back.

567
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,530
巴恩斯小姐的名字记入来访登记簿了吗
Did you put Miss Barnes in the visitor's ledger?

568
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,800
-还没  -那就别记
- Not yet. - Don't.

569
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,760
-不用说  -是的
- Needless to say. - Needless.

570
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,770
你们好
Hello.

571
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
克莱尔
Claire.

572
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,140
这是《华盛顿先驱报》的佐伊・巴恩斯小姐
This is Miss Zoe Barnes of the Washington Herald.

573
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,710
她正准备离开
She was just leaving.

574
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,120
幸会  安德伍德太太
Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Underwood.

575
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,030
开车小心  路面结冰了
Drive safe, there's a lot of ice on the road.

576
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,330
好的
I will.

577
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,270
谢谢
Thank you.

578
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,130
这招真的管用吗
Does that work on anybody?

579
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,250
什么
Does what?

580
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,210
魔术胸罩和V领衬衫
The push-up bra and V-neck T.

581
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,040
据我所知不管用
Well, if it does, I don't know who they are.

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,900
没事的  没事
Ok, it's all right, it's all right.

583
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,870
驾照和行驶证
License and registration.

584
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,860
在仪表板的储物箱里  亲爱的
The glove compartment, sweetheart.

585
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,850
这不是驾照  是星巴克的卡
This isn't your driver's license, it's a Starbucks' card.

586
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,630
见鬼  抱歉
Oh, shit. Sorry.

587
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,010
你喝了什么吗  先生
Sir, have you been drinking?

588
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,330
没有  我这个点从不喝咖啡
No, I never drink coffee at this hour.

589
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,060
请你下车
I'm gonna need you to step out of the car.

590
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,230
如果是超速  开个罚单就得了
Hey, I was speeding you can write me a ticket...

591
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,280
请下车  先生
Sir, step out of the car.

592
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,020
现在就下车
Right now.

593
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,080
我也不想这样  但我是国会议员
Look, I don't wanna be a prick, but I'm a member of the Congress.

594
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,150
你是中国国王也没用
I don't care if you are the king of China.

595
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,190
中国没有国王
China doesn't have a king.

596
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,450
那是共产主义寡头政治
It's a communist oligarchic.

597
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,460
-瓜...寡...寡...  -快下车
- Oil... oliguarch ... - Let's go, out.

598
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,780
-你也是  亲爱的  -妈的  真难念
- You too, sweetie. - Fuck, that's hard to say.

599
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,710
喂
Hello?

600
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
很好
Good.

601
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,810
把他弄出来吧
Well, let's get him out.

602
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,530
我能坐这儿吗
Mind if I join you?

603
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,880
在搞什么鬼
What the fuck is going on?

604
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,610
-我不是要和...  -不是
- I thought I was meeting with... - No.

605
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,800
是和我见面
You're meeting me.

606
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,580
该死的  现在是凌晨四点
It's four in the goddamned morning.

607
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,650
我还要去市议会开会
I've got a City Council meeting...

608
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,960
你当警察局长多久了
You've been Police Commissioner for what?

609
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,610
快十年了吧
Almost a decade now?

610
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,110
我们是来谈我的简历吗
We're here to talk about my resume?

611
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,070
把"华盛顿市长"放在简历里不错吧
"Mayor of DC" would look good on that resume, wouldn't it?

612
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,670
我们知道你早有此意
We know that you've been angling to run for some time.

613
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,140
经验丰富是你的优势
Experience is your strong suit.

614
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,130
但博取公开支持和筹资
Indorsement, fund raising...

615
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,490
你不行
they're not.

616
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,570
我们可以帮你
We can help with that.

617
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,870
罗素
Russo.

618
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,200
你可以走了
You're free to go.

619
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,700
喝了点酒而已
It was just a few drinks.

620
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,970
-都被警察拦下了  -又不是醉得很厉害
- It was enough to get pulled over. - I wasn't drunk drunk.

621
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,170
你当时一个人吗
Were you alone?

622
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,390
是的
Yes.

623
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,390
-看着我说  -注意看路
- Say it to my face. - Watch the road.

624
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,820
看着我说
Say it to my face!

625
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,900
是的
Yes.

626
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,350
我一个人
I was alone.

627
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
你不能再这样了  彼得
You can not keep doing this, Peter.

628
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,510
会让你吃不了兜着走
It's going to catch up with you.

629
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
我知道
I know.

630
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,730
杰弗逊舞会上
Do you think we can arrange two more

631
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,680
我们那桌能再加两个人吗
at our table for the Jefferson Ball?

632
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,430
-加谁  -霍博恩夫妇
- For who? - The Holburnes.

633
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,970
你为什么要找他们去
Why on earth would you want them there?

634
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,670
净水计划需要她的捐款
I'm gonna need her money for the CWI,

635
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,700
光裁员还不够
the staff cuts were just not enough.

636
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,100
我跟瓦斯奎兹说说
I'll talk to Vasquez.

637
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,940
-情况如何  -不错  有进展
- How are we doing? - Good. Progress.

638
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,270
铁烧得正热
Irons on the fire.

639
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,720
我喜欢铁
I like irons,

640
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,730
但更爱火
but I love fire.

641
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,920
好的
Yes.

642
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,790
你这是...
What are you...

643
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,460
你的草案是一纸垃圾  唐纳德
The bill is garbage, Donald.

644
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,800
增加税收  限制半私立学校
Tax increases, ban on vouchers,

645
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,650
增强联邦政府监管
federal oversight.

646
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,990
你怎么能指望我让它通过...
How do you expect me to get that through a...

647
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,800
但是琳达让我来写  她还允诺
But Linda told me to write it, she promise...

648
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,360
她肯定做了不少保证
I'm sure she said any number of things,

649
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,280
把那些都忘了吧  唐纳德
forget what they promised you, Donald.

650
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,340
他们要的是你的名字  因为它份量够重
They want your name because it carrys weight.

651
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,130
我的想法奠定我的名声
Well my name comes with my ideas.

652
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,100
我能理解  但你也得讲理
I understand, but you got to be reasonable.

653
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,660
这不是废奴问题的辩论
This isn't the Great Debate.

654
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,810
我们得让好的改革法案通过
It's about passing meaningful reform,

655
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,620
也许与你的期望有出入  但是
maybe not everything you would've hope, but...

656
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,230
与我方便  与你方便
help me, help you.

657
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,370
我需要时间琢磨
That's gonna take time.

658
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,420
那些想法  我都考虑...
Those ideas I've been developing...

659
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,990
如果你需要时间  我可以为你争取
If it's time you need I will buy you time

660
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,090
但你得保证  你下一稿
but you've got to promise me your next-at-bat

661
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,950
得让我下得去手改
is gonna give me something I can work with.

662
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,720
好吧  弗兰克
Okay, Frank.

663
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,150
我会尽力试试
I'll see what I can do.

664
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,990
很好  唐纳德  别为此难过
Good. And Donald, don't let this get you down.

665
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,290
你我合力  能做到
Why? Together we're gonna do more

666
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,850
你这25年都没做到的事
than you've been able to do in 25 years.

667
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,730
现在有两样无关紧要了
Two things are now irrelevant:

668
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,250
唐纳德・布莱斯和他的新草案
Donald Blythe and Donald Blythe's new draft.

669
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,510
最终我还是得亲自出马重新起草
Eventually I'll have to rewrite the bill myself.

670
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,430
勇往直前  这是我的作战口号
Forward! That is the battle cry.

671
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,510
纸上谈兵那一套
Leave ideologies for the Armchair General,

672
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,030
于我无益
does me no good.

673
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,900
沃克刚刚提名了科恩
Walker just nominated Kern.

674
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,170
离确认通过还早呢
It's a long road to confirmation.

675
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,230
科恩身家清白
Kern is a boy scout.

676
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,880
没人是真正清白的  童子军也不例外  
Nobody is a boy scout, not even boy scouts.

677
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,980
-你有他什么把柄  -什么都没有
- What do you have? - Absolutely nothing.

678
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,400
那我们还有什么好谈的
Then what are we talking about?

679
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,830
就问一个简单的问题  
Just asking the simple question:

680
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,700
你对这份工作有没有兴趣
does the job interest you?

681
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,610
你为什么想要赶走迈克尔
Why would you want Michael gone?

682
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,580
凯茜  你我是"同门"
Cathy, you and I came up together.

683
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,470
外事委员会需要一名能够配合的国务卿
The Foreign Affairs Committee needs a Secretary we can work with,

684
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,540
不怕站出来反驳沃克的错误
someone who isn't afraid to stand up to Walker when he's wrong.

685
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,720
我们需要你
We need you.

686
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,770
假设我有兴趣呢
Let's just assume I am interested.

687
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,120
我不要假设
I do not want to assume.

688
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,160
我要最终答案
I want to know.

689
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,150
2  6
2, 6 ...

690
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,260
好的  2637
Ok ... 2637.

691
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,090
请稍等
Please hold.

692
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,820
佐伊・巴恩斯
Zoe Barnes.

693
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,390
地点你定
Anywhere you want.

694
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,770
马上就来  我回头再找你
On my way. I'm gonna have to call you back.

695
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,870
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

696
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,750
我拦不到出租车  只能乘地铁
I couldn't get a cab, I had to take a train.

697
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,070
你离开我家之前
Just before you left my house,

698
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,130
回想一下
think back

699
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,160
我们当时在讨论什么
what were we discussing?

700
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,210
-总统的立法议程  -具体一点
- The president's legislative agenda. - Specificly.

701
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,380
教育
Education.

702
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,160
-我说对了吗  -你说呢  巴恩斯小姐
- Was I right? - Do the math, Miss Barnes.

703
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,730
-他需要一份法案  -由谁发起
- He needs a bill. - Sponsored by?

704
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,900
-你  -再想想
- You? - You're smarter than that.

705
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,850
-一个比较权威的人  -很好
- Somebody with legitimacy. - Good.

706
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,710
那么谁在教育问题上最权威
And who screams of legitimacy in education?

707
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,490
-唐纳德・布莱斯  -正确  但问题是
- Donald Blythe? - Correct, the problem is?

708
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,330
他是支持高税收高开支的左派
He's an old school tax and spend liberal.

709
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,890
沃克以温和派竞选
Walker run as a moderate.

710
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,470
你觉得布莱斯会跟我谈吗
You think Blythe would talk to me?

711
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,770
没这必要
He doesn't have to.

712
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,830
等等
Wait.

713
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,970
我们现在处于道德和法律的灰色地带
We are in a very grey area ethically, legally

714
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,040
我个人完全没问题
which I'm okay with...

715
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,340
我很喜欢这幅画  你呢
I just love this painting, don't you?

716
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,160
我们现在是一条船上的人了  佐伊
We are in the same boat now, Zoe.

717
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,840
当心别翻船
Take care not to tip it over,

718
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,150
我只能救一个
I can only save one of us from drowning.

719
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,900
卢卡斯

720
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,800
他周一就要宣布教育改革计划了
He announces the education initiative on Monday.

721
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,260
讲话一半的内容是基于
Half of the address is based on...

722
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
-我明白  -我们要去掉这段吗
- I understand. - Do we need to take it out?

723
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,230
没问题的  琳达
We're fine, Linda.

724
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,900
但你才跟我说他需要从头来过
But you just got through saying he has to start over.

725
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,800
不是我选的布莱斯  是你选的
I didn't choose Blythe, you did.

726
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,020
你把他托付给我  要求我创造奇迹
You put him in my lap and ask me to work a miracle,

727
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,490
我会做到  有点信心吧  琳达
and I will. Now have a little faith, Linda.

728
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,180
让我跟唐纳德来搞定它
Let me work with Donald on this.

729
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,120
百日之内能完成  我心里有数
I know what can be accomplished in a hundred days.

730
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,520
好吧  弗兰克
All right, Frank.

731
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,650
-那就全靠你了  -很好
- We're counting on you. - Good.

732
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,270
我想请你帮个小忙
Now I do have a little favor to ask.

733
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,540
杰弗逊舞会上能在我们那桌
Do you think I can get just two more tickets

734
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,760
再安排两个座位吗
for my table at the Jefferson Ball?

735
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,000
来一杯吗
Drink?

736
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:32,960
好啊  都有什么
Sure, what do you got?

737
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,690
调和威士忌
Whiskey, blent.

738
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,960
恭敬不如从命
If you're offering.

739
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,380
那么
So...

740
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,920
费城那边情况如何
How are things in the city of brotherly love?

741
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,970
还过得去吧
We're getting by.

742
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,930
很好  很好
Good. Good.

743
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,880
抱歉  我弄成纯威士忌了  要我...
Oh, sorry, I've made that neat, did you want...

744
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,130
这样就挺好
It's perfect.

745
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,240
那么
So...

746
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,820
你最近可有点不负责任啊
It seems you've been a bit irresponsible.

747
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,520
什么
What?

748
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,670
