1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,690
请说明一下43页第七节
Page 43, section 7. We'd like some clarification.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,130
第七节是是关于评估手段
Section 7 has to do with the evaluative measures--

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,490
评估手段
"Evaluative measures."

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,100
这就是教师绩效标准
What we're talking about here are performance standards,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,320
简单明了
plain and simple.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,920
这是不行的  是在自寻烦恼
We can't have that. We open that can of worms--

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,060
-得删掉它  弗兰克  -政府要加上这点
- Gotta take it out, Frank. - The Administration wants it in.

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,920
那我们就是在浪费时间
Then we're all wasting our time.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,500
我可以降低考核频率
Well, look, I can cut down the frequency of testing,

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,530
但它必须留在法案里
but it's got to be part of the overall--

11
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,530
恶果会滚雪球
That's the thin edge of a two-ton wedge.

12
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,580
-这不行  没得商量  -等等
- No way, non-debatable. - All right, hold on.

13
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,470
听他们说完也没坏处  对吧
There's no harm in hearing them out, right?

14
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,860
弗兰克  你怎么想
Frank, what do you have in mind?

15
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,400
我们修正第四条  给我第四条
We adjust article 4. Hand me article 4.

16
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,760
两年一次改为三年
We go every three years instead of two.

17
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,200
弗兰克  要我们考虑考核...
Frank, for us to even consider testing--

18
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,450
马蒂  这根本就不是频率的问题
Marty, we can't negotiate time intervals here.

19
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,260
我只是说如果这么做
If-- I'm just saying if--

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,240
频率决不能高于五年一次
The frequency could never be more than five years.

21
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,360
五年一次有点低  但如果这你们同意了
Look, five is a little high, but if you can bend on that--

22
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,010
-马蒂  -等等  这不光是频率问题
- Marty. - Wait, wait, wait. And it's not just frequency.

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,770
如果资深教师
Veteran teachers would have to be exempt

24
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,320
教学成绩斐然  他们可以免考
if they have a proven record of excellence with the students.

25
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,480
我得失陪一下
Well, excuse me for a moment.

26
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,930
科瑞  你来说一下这个问题
Corey, will you take the reins on this?

27
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,380
好  第四条  关于免考
Right, so, article 4-- in terms of exceptions--

28
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,760
多年来  我一直说这东西该拆掉
I've been saying for years that we should tear it down.

29
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,730
少女遭遇不幸  郡长指责国会议员

30
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,590
不仅土气  让全郡都丢脸
It's vulgar, it's an embarrassment to the county,

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,590
但弗兰克・安德伍德却一次次
but time and time again Frank Underwood

32
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,660
拼力保住它
has fought to keep it standing.

33
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,280
如果不是他
If it weren't for him,

34
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,670
大桃子早就被改建了
the Peachoid would've been replaced ages ago.

35
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,000
杰西卡・马斯特斯也不会死去
And Jessica Masters would still be alive.

36
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,340
国会议员要为这起悲剧负责
The congressman needs to answer for this tragedy.

37
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,020
究竟发生了什么
What exactly happened?

38
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,090
一名17岁的女孩
A 17-year-old girl

39
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,850
驾车跟男友发短信而冲出大路  短信为
ran off the road texting her boyfriend, and I quote,

40
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,300
"大桃子像不像个巨大的..."
"Doesn't the Peachoid look like a giant..."

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,430
-然后她的车就失控了  -老天
- And then she lost control of the car. - Jesus.

42
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,910
奥林利用当地媒体大做文章
Orrin's making a big fuss in the local press.

43
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,090
他还催促女孩父母起诉加夫尼郡
And he's pushing the parents to sue Gaffney.

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,390
起诉加夫尼  那是他的辖区啊
Sue Gaffney? It's in his own jurisdiction.

45
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
为了把你拖下水
It's worth throwing Gaffney under the bus

46
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,280
他在所不辞
to drag you into the mess.

47
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,840
他又在觊觎我的位子
He's after my seat again.

48
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,840
就没吸取丁点教训吗
Has he learned absolutely nothing?

49
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,720
这是火力全开的诋毁宣传  先生
It's a full-on smear campaign, boss.

50
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,820
他想毁了你
He's out to destroy you.

51
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,810
用这个  天呐  不就是个桃子吗
With this? It's a peach, for Christ sake.

52
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,590
让他自己出丑吧
Let him make a fool out of himself.

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
不  他会让你出丑的
No, he will make a fool out of you.

54
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,930
如果他炒作得当  报道覆盖全国
If he spins this right, gets national coverage--

55
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,800
覆盖全国  这就是个笑话
National coverage? It's a joke.

56
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,400
到时候  你就成笑柄了
And you will be the butt of it.

57
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,070
我们现在不能出事
We can't afford that right now,

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,810
你现在因为教育法案正备受瞩目
not when you're in the spotlight with the education bill.

59
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,450
这事给我惹了这么多麻烦
This thing has caused me so much damn trouble.

60
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,970
-我知道  -我该打给谁  女孩父母吗
- I know. - So who should I call, parents?

61
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,630
打电话是不够的
Phone call's not going to cut it.

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,940
-你得亲自南下  -不能等到周一吗
- You need to go down there. - Can it wait until Monday?

63
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,390
我们马上处理此事  还能控制得住
We get on this thing right now, we can contain it.

64
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,550
如果等到周一
We wait until Monday,

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,490
那就难说这事会造成多大的破坏
then there's no way to know how much this is going to blow up on us.

66
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,510
我不能南下去加夫尼  工会刚
I can't go down to Gaffney. The unions have just--

67
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,020
-我们延期  -他们会发火的
- We postpone-- - They're gonna be livid.

68
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,940
马蒂通事理  会和他们解释的
Marty's reasonable, okay? He will explain to them.

69
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,560
那他们就能理解并接受
And they're just supposed to understand and accept

70
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,200
我不得不中断谈判
that I had to get up from the negotiating table

71
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,730
只因一个小郡长想...
because some two-bit county administrator wants to--

72
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,820
我不想打断你  先生
I don't want to interrupt you, sir,

73
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,440
但这不只是关于奥林
but this is not just about Orrin.

74
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,980
还有女孩的父母
It's about the parents.

75
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,830
你想想诉讼
Now, you think about the lawsuit.

76
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,290
如果要你去做证怎么办
What happens if you have to testify?

77
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,440
传票  宣誓作证
Subpoenas, depositions.

78
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,560
你要是被卷入官司
You get dragged into a court battle,

79
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,620
就别提教育法案了
there is no education bill.

80
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,630
这事不容忽视
We can't ignore this.

81
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,670
小球战术  积累小分  打乱对手节奏

82
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,670
我讨厌这套扯淡的"小球战术"
I just hate this small-ball crap.

83
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,320
叫什么  桃什么
It's called the what? The peach what?

84
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,250
大桃子
The Peachoid.

85
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,850
那是一座桃子状的巨型水塔
It's a giant water tower in the shape of a peach.

86
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,060
我刚谷歌了  大桃子
I just googled it. "The Peachoid."

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,230
她才17岁  琳达
She was 17, Linda.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,650
没错  抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

89
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,520
-再给我一周时间  -这不行
- I need another week. - No, that's not going to work.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,920
总统要在周二做演说
The president makes his speech on Tuesday.

91
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,070
我们已经宣布了
We've already announced.

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,990
演说可以重新安排
Speeches can be rescheduled.

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,060
教改得拿出进展来  弗兰克
We have to show some progress on education, Frank.

94
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,960
就职百天转眼就到
The first hundred days is almost over.

95
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,760
如果我们推迟演说
If we push back the speech,

96
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,570
会让人觉得我们在偷懒
it'll look like we're spinning our wheels.

97
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,640
好吧  我再想想办法
All right, I'll work something out.

98
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,800
谢谢  琳达
Thank you, Linda.

99
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,210
弗兰克  这些人是
Frank, these are the heads

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,880
全国最大的两个教师工会的首脑
of the two largest teachers unions in the country.

101
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,690
-我明白  -他们周末抽空飞过来的
- I understand. - They flew here on a weekend.

102
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,860
道格会主持讨论
Doug will lead the charge.

103
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,580
菲利普斯议员也没问题
Congressman Phillips is well vetted--

104
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,410
他们是飞来见你的  弗兰克
They flew here to see you, Frank.

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,800
是你在负责法案
You're managing this bill.

106
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,560
把这放到那个包里
Put this in the other bag.

107
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,190
我会保持联络的
And I'll be in constant communication.

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,110
有什么要紧事  打电话就行了
Anything big comes up, I'm a phone call away.

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
300页的文件啊
It's a 300-page document.

110
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,470
我们需要你在场
We need you in that room.

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,800
我也是没办法
I would stay if I could,

112
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,110
这可是我的选区啊
but this is my home district.

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,050
马蒂  放我一马吧
Now, Marty, cut me a little slack here.

114
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,560
我们能把它搞定
We'll get it done.

115
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,050
我们是老交情了
You and I go way back.

116
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,230
我让你失望过吗
Have I ever let you down?

117
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,700
没  没有
No, you haven't.

118
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,890
我现在也没这打算
And I don't intend to start now.

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,700
有人吗
Hello?

120
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,590
新项目关注水资源问题

121
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,760
-吉莉安吗  -克莱尔
- Gillian? - Claire.

122
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,370
很高兴终于见面了
It's so nice to finally meet you.

123
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,690
我有点身体不适
Yeah-- I'm a little under the weather.

124
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,990
不想传染给你
I don't want to get you sick.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,980
你要是不舒服  我们可以...
Well, if you're feeling ill, we can--

126
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,210
不不不  没关系  感冒而已
No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just a cold.

127
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,550
非常感谢你过来
Well, thank you for coming in.

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,600
不客气
Of course.

129
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,370
去我办公室谈好吗
Shall we talk in my office?

130
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,160
这些照片真棒
These are really cool photographs.

131
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,680
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

132
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,570
是亚当・嘉乐威拍的
Adam Galloway took the pictures.

133
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,680
你听说过他吗
Have you heard of him?

134
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:30,900
没有
No.

135
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,120
惠特尼双年展: 旨在推动美国前卫艺术的展会

136
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,120
我几年前在惠特尼双年展上遇到他
I met him at the Whitney biennial a couple years ago

137
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,060
54%的饮用水相关疾病是由未处理地下水造成的

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
然后委托他拍了这些
and commissioned him to do these.

139
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,810
PS1: 美国最大  年代最久的非营利性艺术中心  位于纽约长岛

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,810
他刚刚在PS1开了大型摄影展
He just had a big show at PS1.

141
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,850
我对艺术界真的不太了解
I'm not up to date on the art world.

142
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,580
没关系
That's all right.

143
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,160
我们也不是来谈论摄影的  不是吗
We're not here to talk about photography. Are we?

144
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,450
我办公室在这边
My office is over here.

145
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,040
遇到任何麻烦  打电话给我
You run into any trouble, you call me.

146
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,820
没问题的
I got it covered.

147
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,230
吉恩・克兰希知道我要过去吗
Gene Clancy know I'm coming?

148
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,450
刚刚和他通过话
Just spoke to him.

149
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,200
那就去吧

你的航班定好了  55分后起飞

152
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,140
史蒂夫去哪了
Where's Steve?

153
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,910
他一小时前请病假回家了  先生
He went home sick about an hour ago, sir.

154
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,840
我来顶替他
I'll be filling in.

155
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,670
你叫什么来着  姓什么
What's your name again? Edward what?

156
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,030
-密查姆  -你开车快吗  密查姆
- Meacham. - You drive fast, Meacham?

157
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,690
你找我吗
You wanted to talk to me?

158
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,900
进来  佐伊  这位是蒂尔顿太太...
Come on, Zoe. This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of--

159
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,390
她知道我是谁
She knows who I am.

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,070
蒂尔顿太太很喜欢你对凯瑟琳・杜兰特的特写
Mrs. Tilden liked your profile on Catherine Durant.

161
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,190
不  不是喜欢  是非常喜欢
No, I didn't. I loved it.

162
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,730
有深度  非常坚定
In depth, uncompromising.

163
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,900
通常我不会在报道付印前阅读
Normally I don't read things before they go to print,

164
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,400
但凯茜是我的朋友
but Cathy's a friend.

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,940
说说你是怎么提前知道她会获提名的
Tell me how you knew she'd be nominated before she did?

166
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,290
你想知道我的消息来源
You want my source?

167
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,040
汤姆说你不肯告诉他
Tom says you won't tell him.

168
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,670
我谁也没告诉
I haven't told anyone.

169
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,010
我是报社的东家
Well, I own the paper.

170
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,370
能在这里工作我深感荣幸
And I'm very grateful to be working here.

171
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,130
那你也不准备告诉我了
So you're not going to tell me either.

172
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,750
您想要什么  我的联络人还是气节
Which do you want, my source or my integrity?

173
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,970
汤姆
Tom.

174
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,130
把佐伊的报道挪到周日的头版
Move Zoe's piece to the front page of Sunday's edition.

175
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,850
我会考虑的
Let me think that over.

176
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,330
随你怎么考虑
You think it over as much as you want.

177
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,110
然后把它放在头版
Then put it on the front page.

178
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,660
为了让世界之井站稳脚跟我付出了很大努力
I've worked really hard to gain a foothold with World Well.

179
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,570
六年前  只有我自己和一台笔记本
Six years ago it was just me and a macbook.

180
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,520
我明白
I understand.

181
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
打了两份临时工才付得起房租
And I had to juggle two temp jobs just to pay the rent.

182
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
那是你的孩子  你不想放手
It's your baby. You don't want to let it go.

183
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,950
我只是...
Well, I just--

184
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,490
你也不必放手  吉莉安
And you wouldn't have to, Gillian.

185
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,970
我只希望你把亲手建立的事业发展壮大
All I want is for you to grow what you've already built.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,730
我听说你裁掉了一半员工
I heard you fired half your staff.

187
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,130
是的
Yes, I did.

188
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,150
这让我很担心
That worries me.

189
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,290
我让他们走是为给你腾位置
I let them go to make room for you.

190
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,760
我不确定我们是否合适
I'm just not sure we're the right match.

191
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,690
说实话  我不太愿意
To be honest, I'm a little uncomfortable

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,540
跟一个雇得起著名摄影师的人共事
working with someone who's commissioning famous photographers

193
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,890
我都付不起我志愿者的公车票
when I can't even buy my volunteers bus fair to the office.

194
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,830
你知道妮姬・海姆勒吗
Do you know who Nicky Hemler is?

195
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,090
-不  -妮姬拥有切尔西最大的画廊
- No. - Nicky owns one of the biggest galleries in Chelsea.

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,220
她十分想作亚当・嘉乐威的代理人
She desperately wanted to represent Adam Galloway.

197
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,860
我帮她牵了线
I delivered on Adam,

198
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,390
作为回报
and in return

199
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,890
她每年给净水计划捐赠近4万美元
she contributes almost 40 grand a year to CWI.

200
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,500
这些钱用于作影响研究
That money goes to impact studies,

201
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,980
游说工作和调查
lobbying efforts, research.

202
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,260
这种钱对世界之井益处良多  吉莉安
World Well could benefit from that sort of money, Gillian,

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,830
而你的专长对我们益处良多
and we can benefit from your expertise.

204
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,650
我能想想吗
Can I think about it?

205
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,980
当然
Of course.

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,600
不必操之过急
We don't have to jump into anything.

207
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,950
我在这个小乡村长大
I grew up here, in the up country--

208
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,840
《圣经》  烧烤  沉重的负担
Bibles, barbecues, and broken backs.

209
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,460
这么靠南的地方  一切都更加浓郁
Everything gets just a little bit thicker this far south.

210
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,220
空气  血液  甚至我自己
The air, the blood, even me.

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,270
我尽量每个月过来一次
I try to make it down here at least once a month.

212
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,770
欢迎弗兰克・J・安德伍德议员来到南卡罗来纳州加夫尼

213
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,530
每次来都会提醒我走了多远
Every trip is a reminder of how far I've come.

214
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,570
小时候我讨厌加夫尼  那时我一无所有
I hated Gaffney as a kid, when I had nothing.

215
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,410
但现在我能够欣赏它
but now I've come to appreciate it.

216
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,790
它不像从前那样压抑难耐了
It's not as suffocating as it once was,

217
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,610
除了我要来处理这种让我想
except when I have to deal with the sort of nonsense

218
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,950
悬梁自尽的屁事的时候
that makes me want to hang myself.

219
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,890
路线一左转
Turn left on route one.

220
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,510
别听她的  我知道怎么走
Don't listen to her. I know a better way.

221
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,540
好的
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,280
我们没钱  弗兰克
We don't have the money, Frank.

223
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
单是诉讼费就够我们受的
The legal bills alone will kill us.

224
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,970
和解呢
How about a settlement?

225
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,850
我看钱数吧
I'll look at the numbers.

226
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,580
你说它像什么
What's it look like to you?

227
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,120
桃子
Like a peach.

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,050
我是说你到底怎么想的
No, I mean what does it really look like?

229
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,740
作为郡长  我还认定像桃子
As mayor, I stick with a peach.

230
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,750
作为老百姓
As a private citizen,

231
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,620
它看着像阳光照耀到了不该照到的地方
well, it looks like the sun is shining where it shouldn't be.

232
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,260
有更好的处理方法
There's a better way to handle this.

233
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,250
真的吗  弗兰克  什么方法
Really, Frank? And what's that?

234
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,010
我不是来吵架的
I'm not trying to start an argument here.

235
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,920
你说得好像我错了
You make it sound like I'm in the wrong.

236
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,690
不  你很清楚自己在做什么  奥林
No, you know exactly what you're doing, Orrin.

237
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,100
你利用这可怜女孩的死
You're using this poor girl's death

238
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,670
为自己谋政治利益
for your own political advantage.

239
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,630
我打算推倒水塔
You're the one that fought me

240
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,980
那些桃农怨声载道时
when the peach farmers bitched and moaned

241
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,780
是你跟我叫板
about me tearing it down.

242
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,260
是你拿了他们的钱
You're the one that took their money.

243
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,440
-只是个水塔  -是个荒唐的东西
- It's a water tower. - It's ungodly.

244
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,500
-奥林  -这是老生常谈了  弗兰克
- Orrin. - This is cut and dry, Frank.

245
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,140
我要推倒它
I fought to tear it down.

246
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,720
而你要留着它
You fought to keep it up.

247
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,170
那女孩的死是你的错
That girl's blood is on your hands,

248
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,920
我要你为之负责
and I'm taking you to task for it.

249
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,820
好吧  告诉你
All right, I'll tell you what.

250
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,250
迪克・彼得斯要卸任了
Dick Peters is going to retire this term.

251
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,740
就是说第四选区会有场公开竞选
That means there's an open race in the fourth district.

252
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,890
我帮你搞定那职位怎样
How about I help you lock up that seat?

253
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,220
我没想做交易  弗兰克
I'm not looking to make a deal, Frank.

254
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,540
这不是交易
It's not a deal.

255
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,630
是机遇
It's an opportunity.

256
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,510
算了吧
I'll be just fine.

257
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,270
你或许鄙视我  奥林
You may despise me, Orrin,

258
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
但邀请我们上去
but the classy thing to do

259
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,850
喝些冰茶
would've been to invite us up

260
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,450
才叫有气度
for some of that iced tea.

261
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,610
你在干什么
What are you doing?

262
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,340
你不该在这儿跑步
You shouldn't run here.

263
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,820
真不知羞耻
It's disgraceful.

264
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,020
你不懂得尊重吗
Have you no respect?

265
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,690
考核标准是出发点
The criteria is a starting point.

266
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,550
只是建议  不是强制的
They're suggested, not mandated.

267
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,110
我们召集了专家智囊团
We assemble a council of experts

268
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,280
他们会定夺究竟...
who will determine exactly--

269
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,880
这里压根没说那些专家是谁
Nowhere here does it say who these experts are,

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,270
或如何甄选
how they'll be chosen.

271
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,870
总统亲自挑选
The president selects the council.

272
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,060
如何监管
What sort of oversight?

273
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,560
我们要参与甄选
We'd like input on the selection.

274
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,540
道格  联系琳达
Doug, check with Linda.

275
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,680
这就去
Calling her now.

276
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,890
好的  现在可以谈谈特许学校了吗
Okay, so now can we talk about charter schools?

277
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,230
特许学校不行
Charter schools are a no-go.

278
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,310
法案里必须有
They have to be in there.

279
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,510
保留他们  就别谈了
You keep them in, we walk.

280
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,550
我们也是
The same goes for us.

281
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,920
别急着下最后通牒
Let's not jump to ultimatums.

282
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,910
想办法减少对非公立学校的资助吧
Well, let's figure out a way to reduce non-public spending.

283
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,370
容我想几分钟
All right, give me a few minutes to think about that.

284
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,010
这事不说明白我们没法继续
We can't move forward without addressing this point.

285
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,490
我明白  但这是法案的基础啊
I understand, but this is the cornerstone of the bill.

286
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,680
那就谈谈吧
Let's talk it out.

287
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,540
给我五分钟  马蒂  马上回电
Give me five minutes, Marty. I'll call you right back.

288
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,590
不  别
No, no.

289
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,850
如果我们考虑和解
If we consider settlement as an option,

290
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,030
我们得付得起钱
we need to be able to pay for it.

291
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,580
但如果我们要和解
But if we offer a settlement,

292
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,040
-是不是  -我就这个意思
- aren't we saying... - That's my point.

293
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,940
我们等于承认小镇要为这孩子的死负责
We're admitting that the town's responsible for this kid's death.

294
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,820
要我说  让桃农付钱
I say make the peach farmers cough it up.

295
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,040
老天  那可要闹翻天了
Oh, man, talk about a shit storm.

296
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,600
麻烦说说谈到哪了
Y'all mind catchin' me up?

297
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,480
维恩和崔维斯想上法庭
Wayne and Travis want to go to court.

298
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,880
我觉得这不是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

299
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,650
我们不能把钱砸到和解上
We can't be pouring money into a settlement

300
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,740
我们的钱都不够城市运营了
when we can barely afford to run the city.

301
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,020
吉恩  你怎么看
What do you think, gene?

302
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,460
我觉得我们该提防桃农协会
I think that we gotta worry about the peach farmers association.

303
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,220
我们哪怕流露出一点归咎于大桃子的意思
If there is a hint that we're blaming the Peachoid,

304
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,940
他们都会闹得不可开交
they're going to raise holy hell.

305
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,790
谁在乎啊  让他们都忍着
Who gives a crap. They gotta suck it up.

306
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,150
让他说完
Let him talk.

307
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,630
我就是说  得小心他们
I'm just saying that we need to keep them in mind.

308
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,320
她违法了  事情就是这样
She was breaking the law. End of story.

309
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,060
开车时不该发短信
You can't text while you drive.

310
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,400
但陪审团只会看到
Yeah, but all a jury's going to see

311
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,060
一个漂亮的花季少女现在死了
is a beautiful 17-year-old girl who's now dead.

312
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,860
无意冒犯  弗兰克  但你刚到这儿
No offense, Frank, but you just got here.

313
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,790
而我们已经讨论一个星期了
We've been dealing with this for the last week now.

314
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,570
那你们的解决方案呢
And where's your solution?

315
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,570
怎么
What?

316
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,400
你觉得你比我们厉害吗
You think you know better than us?

317
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,110
我只是想现实一点
I'm just trying to be realistic.

318
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,270
弗兰克  我知道你想从天而降  挽救大局
Frank, I know you want to swoop down and save the day,

319
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,100
但这事关原则
but there's a principle at stake here.

320
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,010
我们要是就为这种事被人敲诈...
We allow ourselves to be extorted because of this teenager--

321
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,370
等奥林找来陪审团为这女孩挥泪如雨
When Orrin gets a jury to weep a river of snot over this dead girl,

322
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,660
等加夫尼因为
when Gaffney goes tits up

323
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,720
付不起上百万的赔偿而破产
because you can't afford to pay a seven-figure award in damages,

324
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,140
等你们都被一脚踹出办公室
when you all get booted out of office

325
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,580
而我也输给蔡斯
and I lose to Chase,

326
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,020
那时你再来跟我唠叨你的原则
then you can chew my ear off about principles,

327
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,590
因为到时我们唯一不缺的就是时间
because we'll all have nothing but time on our hands.

328
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,440
在那之前
Until then,

329
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,760
你要么出力
you either contribute,

330
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,240
要么就闭嘴  崔维斯
or you keep it shut, Travis.

331
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,590
好了  我们这么办
Now, here's what we're going to do.

332
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
吉恩  如果必须和解
Gene, how much can we pull together

333
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,010
-我们能凑多少钱  -大约15万
- for a settlement if we had to? - About 150.

334
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,350
足够了  詹米  让你手下去五金店
That'll work. Jamie, get your boys down to the hardware store

335
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,520
造两块公告牌
to build two billboards.

336
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,680
放在塔两侧各一英里的地方
Put them out a mile out on either side of the tower.

337
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,460
写上"小心驾车  莫发短信"
Have them read, "Drive safely. No texting behind the wheel."

338
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,500
-知道了  -明早前完工
- Got it. - And get those up by tomorrow morning.

339
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,750
我来发许可证
I'll issue the permits.

340
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,820
以后晚上把塔上的灯熄了
And let's stop lighting the thing at night.

341
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,310
桃农不会高兴的
The peach farmers aren't going to like that.

342
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,850
开灯的话要多少电费
Well, how much does the electric cost?

343
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,450
每个月超过4100美元
4,100 plus change per month.

344
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,410
一年大约5万
About 50,000 a year.

345
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,140
天啊  都够供一个孩子上大学了
Jesus, you could put a kid through college on--

346
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,600
我们用这笔钱以她的名义办个奖学金
Let's use that money to start a scholarship fund in her name.

347
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,510
同时  你和桃农协会说
Meantime, you tell the association,

348
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,240
他们想晚上点亮它  就自己付电费
if they want it lit up, they can pay for it.

349
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,950
我很乐意传达这个消息
I'll deliver that message happily.

350
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,940
再给我拟一份拆掉"肛门"的计划和预算
And do me up a budget and a plan for removing the sphincter.

351
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,950
拆掉什么
The what?

352
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,100
他是指塔上的应急阀
He means the emergency valve.

353
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,430
有意思
That's interesting.

354
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,270
我一直觉得它长得像阴蒂
I always thought of it as a clitoris.

355
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,630
可那东西在底下啊
But it's on bottom.

356
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,860
阴蒂应该是在上面...
I believe the clitoris is above the--

357
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,080
但假设那女的是趴着的话
But if you imagine a woman on her belly--

358
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,030
行了  去做就是了
Enough. I want it done.

359
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,420
还有  吉恩  把所有交通条例都拿给我
And, Gene, give me everything you've got on road regulations.

360
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,650
要郡级章程  不要市级的
County statutes, not municipal.

361
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,980
你还记得上次选举我们叫停的
And do you remember that power line business

362
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,720
那个电力线工程吗
we pulled up at the last election?

363
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,580
当然
Sure do.

364
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
确保那事万无一失
Let's make sure we're rock solid on that.

365
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,970
这顿价值不菲的晚餐
Does this very expensive dinner

366
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,240
换得来一晚美妙的鱼水之欢吗
at least buy me an evening of mind-blowing sexual congress?

367
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,970
还不错  但也没那么好吧
It was good, but I don't know if it was that good.

368
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,780
好到可以口交吗
Fellatio good?

369
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,250
也许给你打个手枪  不能保证
Hand job maybe. No promises.

370
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,130
也行
Deal.

371
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,700
彼得  我有事情和你说
Okay, um, Peter, there's something I need to tell you.

372
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,030
我最近一直在想
I have been thinking lately.

373
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,900
换个工作可能会是好事
You know, um, it might be good to work somewhere else.

374
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,090
我参加了几次面试
So I did some interviews,

375
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,590
议长办公室请我做人力分配部副主管
and the speaker's office offered me deputy LD.

376
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,440
彼得
Peter.

377
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,780
克里斯蒂娜
Christina, um--

378
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,610
我觉得这挺好的  对吧
I just thought it could be good, right,

379
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,770
如果我们要发展下去
if we're going to have any future,

380
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,990
结束上下级恋情  成为真正的情侣
to stop this boss-staffer thing and be a real couple.

381
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,150
我们就是情侣啊
We are a real couple.

382
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,770
我是指不用再在办公室遮遮掩掩的
I mean not have to hide it like we do at the office.

383
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,640
而且这个机会很不错
And it's a great opportunity.

384
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,870
那可是议长
The speaker?

385
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,810
如果我接了这份工作  你会怨我吗
Would you hate me if I took the job?

386
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,710
宝贝  你想要的就是我想要的
Baby, I want what you want.

387
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,770
我没有  我不会反对你
I'm not-- I won't fight you on this,

388
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,040
只要这是你想要的
not if this is what you feel you need to do.

389
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,810
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

390
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,360
你说得对
And you're right.

391
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,230
这是个好机会
This is a great opportunity.

392
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,460
你要什么时候给他们答复
When do you have to tell them by?

393
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,670
没设期限  我不用马上就做决定
There's no deadline. I don't have to decide right away.

394
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,770
那行  等你决定了
Okay, well, when you decide,

395
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,780
记得帮我找个人接替你
just, you know, help me find a replacement.

396
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,910
提前通知我一声
You know, give me a heads-up.

397
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,040
当然
Yeah, of course.

398
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,070
我还没决定要不要接受那份工作呢
I haven't even decided if I'm going to take it.

399
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,450
我们不用急着讨论这事
We don't have to talk this through right now.

400
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,720
我只是觉得应该跟你提一下
I just-- I just thought I'd bring it up.

401
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,170
-我们回家啊  -好极了
- Should we get out of here? - Yes.

402
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,210
咱们去找那对父母吧
Let's go find the parents.

403
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,250
你就在这儿守着
You hang back by the car.

404
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,960
那里人很多  先生
It's a big crowd, sir.

405
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,240
如果我安慰一对悲痛的父母时中枪或遇刺
If I get shot or stabbed consoling two grieving parents,

406
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,180
那么我将流芳千古
I'm a hero from now until the end of time.

407
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,570
我们赌一把吧  好吗
Let's roll the dice. Shall we?

408
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,490
先生  我不能允许你只身走入人群
Sir, I can't allow you to go unescorted into all those people.

409
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,940
允许我
Allow me?

410
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,770
有件事我们得说清楚  密查姆
Let's get one thing straight, Meacham.

411
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,040
我能做什么不能做什么  这你管不着
You are never to dictate what I can and cannot do.

412
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,880
我吩咐你做事的时候
The only two words I want to hear from you

413
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,380
只想听到两个词
when I ask you to do something

414
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,430
"是的"还有"先生"
are "Yes" and "Sir."

415
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,120
明白了吗
Is that understood?

416
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,410
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

417
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,690
很好  我们会相处融洽的
Good. Then we're gonna get along just fine.

418
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,820
马斯特斯先生和太太
Mr. and Mrs. Masters,

419
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,150
我是本区议员弗兰克・安德伍德
I'm Frank Underwood, your congressman.

420
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,450
请二位节哀顺变
I'm so sorry for your loss.

421
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
我无法体会
I cannot begin to fathom--

422
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,740
没错  你不能  你完全无法体会
You're right. You can't. You have no idea.

423
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,380
请原谅  我无意打扰  只是想
Forgive me. I don't mean to intrude. I just--

424
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,650
-你已经打扰到我们了  -迪恩  别这样
- Well, you are intruding. - Dean, please.

425
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,690
怎么了
What?

426
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,360
这全怪他  不是吗
It's his fault. Isn't it?

427
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,700
不管怎样  我只是想表示哀悼
Anyway, I just wanted to express my condolences,

428
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,740
如果两位有任何需要
and say if there's anything the two of you nee--

429
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,330
迪恩  你不会想跟他谈的
Dean, you don't want to be talking to him.

430
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,130
我们会诉诸法律
We got legal action pending.

431
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,530
我知道蔡斯先生的看法  也相信
Look, I know what Mr. Chase has been saying, and believe--

432
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,980
没人邀请你来
Nobody invited you.

433
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,620
没人需要你的哀悼或是借口
Nobody wants your condolences or your excuses.

434
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,550
弗兰克  你走吧
Frank, please.

435
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,980
你现在不该承受这些
You shouldn't have to put up with this right now.

436
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,020
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

437
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,160
进展顺利啊
Well, that went well.

438
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,030
等一下
Hang on a second.

439
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,440
牧师先生
Reverend.

440
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,060
议员先生
Congressman.

441
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
见到你真好
Nice to see you again.

442
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,510
真希望情况不是这个样子
I wish it was under better circumstances.

443
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,520
真是可怕的惨剧
Terrible, isn't it?

444
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,420
太不幸了
It's just terrible.

445
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,050
你组织这场活动真是费心了
This is so thoughtful what you've organized here.

446
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,310
绵薄之力罢了
Least we can do.

447
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,170
马斯特斯一家是你的教众吗
Tell me, are the Masters in your congregation?

448
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,550
是的  他们每周日都来
They are. They come every Sunday.

449
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,670
他们明天也会去做礼拜吗
Do you think they'll be at the service tomorrow?

450
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,140
一定会的
I'd be surprised if they weren't.

451
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,720
能帮我个忙吗
I'm wondering can you do me a favor?

452
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,780
什么都行  弗兰克
Anything for you, Frank.

453
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,850
蓝色的牙刷是你的  对吧
Oh, the blue toothbrush is yours, right?

454
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,950
对  蓝色的
Uh, yeah, the blue one.

455
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,710
-彼得  -什么事
- Hey, Peter? - Yeah?

456
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,590
你把灯泡放哪了
Where do you keep the light bulbs?

457
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,300
卧室的灯不亮了
The lamp in the bedroom is out.

458
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,230
在厨房水槽下面
In the kitchen, under the sink.

459
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,320
我是这么想的
Here's what I think.

460
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,530
我也希望自己能大度一些  但我做不到
I wish I could be bigger than this, but I can't,

461
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,870
我这么做很自私
and I'm being selfish,

462
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,610
而且也只顾着自己  但管它呢
and I realize it's mostly about me, but fuck it.

463
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,300
我必须说出来
I have to say it.

464
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,980
请不要接受那份工作  克里斯蒂娜
Please don't take that other job, Christina.

465
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,340
反正  我就是这么想的
Anyway, that's how I feel.

466
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,580
很高兴你告诉我了
I'm glad you told me.

467
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,700
特许学校危及我们的组织能力
Charters jeopardize our ability to organize,

468
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,570
这个理由就足够了
which is reason enough,

469
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,590
但更大的问题是
but the bigger issue is

470
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,450
以他们的绩效
that measuring their success--

471
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,510
特许学校一直遵行的
Charters schools have operated

472
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,660
评估标准  无异于任何...
under the same evaluative standards that every--

473
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,830
不同事物  区别对待
Apples and oranges.

474
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,710
不论从哪个角度出发
No matter how you look at it,

475
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,250
都不能用同一套标准去衡量
you can't use the same standards to compare.

476
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,070
你是在说
What, you're advocating a

477
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,690
特效学校的考核标准应该更严格吗
more demanding criteria for charter schools than other schools--

478
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,380
我们的意思很简单  弗兰克
Our point is simple, Frank.

479
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,140
有些款项只能拨给
Several funds should only go

480
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,280
-联邦公立学校  -等一下
- to public union school districts - Hold on a second.

481
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,020
但我们已经将非特许学校的拨款增加了一成
Yeah, but we've already increased non-charter funding by 10%.

482
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,690
拨给特许学校的款项根本微不足道
The amount going to charter schools is negligible.

483
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,000
这事没有先例  弗兰克  与数目无关
It's the precedent, Frank, not the number.

484
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,730
我们要开启很多先例  马蒂
We're setting a lot of precedents, Marty.

485
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,620
这才叫改革
That's the nature of reform.

486
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,930
有些可以忍受  有些不能忍
Well, some of them we can stomach. Some of them we can't.

487
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,780
我们别纠结于这些模糊的问题了
All right, let's not get bogged down in abstractions.

488
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,190
谈一下具体事宜吧
Let's deal with specifics.

489
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,050
科瑞  带我们从头理一遍吧
Corey, can you walk us through it?

490
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,560
确定拨款的数额
There's a three-prong approach

491
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,620
要采用三分法...
to determining the amount of funding...

492
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,970
想我了吗
Miss me?

493
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,390
也许有一点
Maybe. A little.

494
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,470
我们分开多久了  有15个小时吗
What's it been, 15 hours?

495
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,890
短到我都没发觉你离开了
Not even long enough to notice you're gone.

496
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,280
马蒂・斯比奈拉也这么想就好了
Tell that to Marty Spinella.

497
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,580
进展如何了
How's it coming?

498
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,850
进展缓慢而痛苦
It's coming. Slowly, painfully.

499
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,400
我们家前院里一直种着郁金香吗
Hey, have we always had tulips in the front yard,

500
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,640
还是我脑子不好使了
or am I slowly going insane?

501
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,360
我去年秋天种的
I planted them last fall.

502
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,830
你没有
You did not.

503
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,080
我跟你一起去那儿为选举做宣传的时候
When I was down with you for the campaign.

504
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,330
你这辈子都没碰过花花草草
You've never gardened a day in your life.

505
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,200
不对  我这辈子刚好侍弄过一天花花草草
Not true. I have gardened exactly one day in my life.

506
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,630
你当时在斯帕坦堡筹集资金
You were down in Spartanburg doing some sort of fundraiser.

507
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,950
吉恩妻子带着一篮子球茎来看我
Gene's wife came over with a bucket of bulbs,

508
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,100
接着我就跪在泥巴里
and next thing you knew, I was down on my knees in the dirt,

509
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,590
和蚯蚓为伴了
earthworms and all.

510
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,070
我简直无法想象
I can't even picture it.

511
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,650
我也不能  我还是当事人呢
Neither can I, and I was there.

512
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,560
说说别的
What else?

513
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,730
让我别去想大桃子和死去的少女
Distract me from giant peaches and dead teenagers.

514
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,880
说什么呢
What else?

515
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,670
我今天去跑步了
Oh, I went for a run today,

516
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,000
发生了件奇怪的事
and the strangest...

517
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,270
说不清楚  有个女人
I-- I don't know. This woman...

518
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,020
-有意思  -怎么了
- That's interesting. - What is?

519
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,670
-佐伊・巴恩斯刚发来一条短信  -谁
- Oh, a text just came. Zoe Barnes. - Who?

520
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,600
佐伊  68小时23分钟11秒

521
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,220
你那晚见过的那个《先驱报》记者
Oh, that reporter from the herald you met one night.

522
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,330
我记得她
Oh, her. I remember.

523
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,380
要是需要给她回电话你就挂了吧
Yeah, go if you need to call her back.

524
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,900
不用  她可以等
No, she can wait.

525
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,440
我可在和我妻子通话
I'm talking to my wife.

526
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,500
没关系  反正我也要去睡了
That's okay. I'm going to bed soon anyway.

527
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,580
明天见
See you tomorrow?

528
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,290
希望如此  祝我好运
I hope so. Wish me luck.

529
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,050
晚安  我的小桃子
Mm, bonsoir, my petite Peachoid.

530
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,670
真恶心
Disgusting.

531
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,470
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

532
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,640
好的  没问题  科瑞  马蒂
Yeah, all right, that's fine, Corey. Marty?

533
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,640
弗兰克  我给你解释一下  问题在这儿
Frank, let me explain it to you. Here's our problem.

534
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,100
弗兰克・安德伍德  什么意思

535
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,450
佐伊  我们有这么久没通话了

536
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,700
佐伊  你在哪

537
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,320
佐伊  在干什么

538
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,130
佐伊  接下来会怎么样

539
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,730
佐伊  告诉我

540
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,280
弗兰克・安德伍德  南卡罗来纳  选区事务

541
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,240
佐伊  方便说话吗

542
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,790
弗兰克・安德伍德  现在不行  正在忙

543
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,120
佐伊  还有什么事能比我还急

544
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,970
弗兰克・安德伍德  你真是不可抵挡

545
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,500
佐伊  不可抵挡  我还没开始呢

546
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,320
弗兰克・安德伍德  我简直无法想象

547
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,520
佐伊  你肯定想象得到

548
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,670
佐伊  你肯定已经想过了

549
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,080
佐伊  看明天的《出发点》  我会飞个吻给你

550
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,000
弗兰克  弗兰克  你断线了吗
Frank? Frank, did we lose you?

551
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,670
我在听  马蒂
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Marty.

552
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,060
听着  我们可以就特许学校的事继续兜圈子
Look, we can talk ourselves in circles about charter schools,

553
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,990
但我建议这样做
but here's what I propose.

554
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,530
佐伊・巴恩斯访谈

555
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,900
在你的人物特写里  你对杜兰特职业生涯早期
In your profile, you go into great detail

556
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,800
所面对的性别歧视进行了很细致的描述
about the sexism Durant faced early on in her career.

557
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,840
没错
That's right.

558
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,460
她最初当选的时候
When she was first elected,

559
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,470
参议院还是男人的世界
it was still an old boy's club in the senate.

560
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,130
不久之前  新闻业也是一样的
Journalism used to be that way, too, not so long ago.

561
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,830
我真的感到很幸运
I feel really lucky.

562
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,130
我前面有很多的开拓者
I've had lots of trailblazers come before me.

563
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,360
比如我的同事  简宁・斯克斯基
For instance, my colleague Janine Skorsky

564
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,020
是《先驱报》首位
was the first woman at the herald

565
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,650
成为首席政治记者的女性
to become chief political correspondent,

566
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,620
而那距今也只有五年
and that was only five years ago.

567
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,680
是那些开拓者
Has it been those trailblazers

568
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,480
让你晋升得如此迅速吗
who've allowed you to rise so quickly?

569
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,020
你从都市板块
You've moved up from the Metro pages

570
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,360
走上了周日的头版
to the front page Sunday edition.

571
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,000
如果不是有简宁在前铺路
Uh, well, I don't know that that would be possible

572
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,040
我恐怕是做不到这一切的
if Janine hadn't already paved the way.

573
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,890
这是否意味着
So does that mean that

574
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,790
《先驱报》不够进步
the herald is not particularly progressive?

575
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,010
我认为够进步了  汤姆的思想很开放
I think that they are. Tom is very open minded.

576
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,090
简宁能获得升职也是因为他
He's the reason Janine got promoted.

577
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,200
我们说的是汤姆・汉默施密特  执行主编
That's Tom Hammerschmidt, the executive editor.

578
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,220
没错  我们都叫他锤子
Yes, we actually call him the hammer.

579
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,940
锤子  为什么
The hammer? Why?

580
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,150
因为他很严厉
Because he's tough.

581
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,110
有多严厉
How tough?

582
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,010
他  汤姆有很高的标准
He's, uh-- Tom has very high standards.

583
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,070
我很爱他
I love him.

584
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,280
他是位伟大的导师
He's a-- he's a great mentor.

585
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,550
不过有时会让人觉得沮丧
Um, it can be frustrating at times.

586
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:14,730
他会让你反复核查稿件
Um, he makes you double and triple-check things,

587
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,550
而你一拿到新闻就急着想发表
and you want to get the news out the moment you have it,

588
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,730
而他会让你不断修改  直到完美
and he makes you rewrite until it's perfect,

589
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,950
但正是这份严谨成就了《先驱报》
but that's what makes the Herald the Herald.

590
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,610
这种模式在网络时代依然可行吗
Is that a workable model in the Internet age?

591
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,940
我们的读者认为可行
Our readers think it is.

592
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,850
可你们的读者人数在下滑
Well, you have a declining readership.

593
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,440
但我不认为这是汤姆的责任
But I don't lay that at Tom's feet.

594
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,500
我们所处的时代就是如此  不是吗
I think that that's the times we live in, right?

595
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,410
报纸应该迎合我们所处的时代吗
Should newspapers adapt to the times we live in?

596
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,380
《先驱报》并没有拒绝改变
It's not that the Herald refuses to adapt.

597
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,260
我们有网络版
We have an online presence.

598
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,570
那会不会是你们改变得不够快
Is that maybe not adapting fast enough?

599
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,130
我不会反驳这一观点
I wouldn't argue with that statement.

600
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,570
我们可以更加努力
We could do more.

601
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,990
我们今天有一位特别来宾
We've got a special guest with us today.

602
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,860
他请求能借今早的机会
He asked for the opportunity

603
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,130
和大家说几句话
to share a few words with us this morning--

604
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,050
有请本区国会议员  弗兰克・安德伍德  
Our very own congressman, Frank Underwood.

605
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,810
-早上好  -早上好
- Good morning. - Good morning.

606
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,950
谢谢你  牧师
Thank you, reverend,

607
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,620
也感谢唱诗班带来的美妙圣歌
and thanks to that choir for that beautiful hymn.

608
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,600
我今天早上想读的内容  是...
I want to read, this morning, from...

609
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,790
不
No.

610
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,980
有一个话题人人回避
You know what no one wants to talk about.

611
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,430
恨
Hate.

612
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,840
我非常了解恨
I know all about hate.

613
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,890
它在你腹中酝酿
It starts in your gut,

614
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,150
在你体内深处
deep down here,

615
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,680
搅动翻腾
where it stirs and churns.

616
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,560
接着它涌起
And then it rises.

617
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,770
恨意猛烈而迅猛地上升
Hate rises fast and volcanic.

618
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,060
令人冲口而出激动的话语
It erupts hot on the breath.

619
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,260
你怒目圆睁  充满怒火
Your eyes go wide with fire.

620
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,000
你咬紧牙关
You clench your teeth so hard

621
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,960
简直要咬碎牙齿
you think they'll shatter.

622
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,070
我恨你  上帝  我恨你
I hate you, God. I hate you!

623
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,410
别说你们从没说过这句话
Oh, don't tell me you haven't said those words before.

624
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,770
我知道你们说过
I know you have.

625
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,520
我们都说过
We all have,

626
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,330
只要你曾经历如此沉痛的打击
if you've ever felt so crushing a loss.

627
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,770
今天在座有一对父母
There are two parents with us today

628
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,570
他们了解这种痛苦
who know that pain,

629
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,580
最沉重的伤痛  莫过于
the most terrible hurt of all--

630
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,780
失去一个尚年轻的孩子
losing a child before her time.

631
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,430
如果迪恩和莉安现在站起来
If Dean and Leanne were to stand up right now

632
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,430
吼出那些充满恨意的可怕词句
and scream those awful words of hate,

633
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,000
我们能责怪他们吗
could we blame them?

634
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,310
我做不到
I couldn't.

635
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,870
至少我能理解他们心中的恨
At least their hatred I can understand.

636
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,740
我能体会
I can grasp it,

637
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,220
但上帝的无常
but God's wantonness,

638
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,170
冷酷无情
his cruelty,

639
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,860
我甚至不能...
I can't even begin to--

640
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,390
我的父亲因心脏病猝死
My father dropped dead of a heart attack

641
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,730
年仅43岁  43岁
at the age of 43-- 43 years old--

642
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,790
当他离开时  我仰望上苍
and when he died, I looked up to God

643
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,540
说了这些话
and I said those words,

644
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,060
因为我父亲还如此年轻
because my father was so young,

645
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,710
如此精力充沛  满怀梦想
so full of life, so full of dreams.

646
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,500
为什么上帝要把他夺走
Why would God take him from us?

647
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,290
其实  我并不了解他
Truth be told I never really knew him

648
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,560
也不知道他的梦想
or what his dreams were.

649
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,920
他沉默  胆小 没人在意他
He was quiet, timid, almost invisible.

650
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,160
我的母亲瞧不起他
My mother didn't think much of him.

651
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,820
我外婆讨厌他
My mother's mother hated him.

652
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,060
他根本从未真正地活过
The man never scratched the surface of life.

653
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,580
也许他早逝是件好事
Maybe it's best he died so young.

654
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,710
他没什么贡献  只是占地方罢了
He wasn't doing much but taking up space.

655
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,880
但这样的悼词哪有震撼力  是不是
But that doesn't make for a very powerful eulogy, now, does it?

656
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,700
我流泪  我哭喊  "为什么  上帝"
I wept. I screamed, "Why, God?

657
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,960
我怎能不恨你
How can I not hate you

658
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,230
你从我身边偷走了这个世界上
when you steal from me the person I most love

659
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,150
我最爱最崇敬的人
and admire in this world?

660
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,670
我无法理解  并为此恨你
I don't understand it, and I hate you for it.

661
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,370
《圣经:箴言篇》中写道
The Bible says in proverbs,

662
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,140
"你要专心仰赖耶和华
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart

663
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,340
不可倚靠自己的聪明"
and lean not on your own understanding."

664
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,920
不可倚靠自己的聪明
Lean not on your own understanding.

665
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,470
上帝告诫我们无条件信任他
God is telling us to trust him,

666
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,750
尽管我们无知  仍要爱他
to love him despite our own ignorance.

667
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,310
毕竟  信仰是什么
After all, what is faith

668
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,440
不就是在考验最严峻时依旧能坚持到底吗
if it doesn't endure when we are tested the most?

669
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,630
我们永远不会明白
We will never understand

670
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,120
为什么上帝夺走了杰西卡
why God took Jessica

671
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,500
我的父亲或其他人
or my father or anyone.

672
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,190
虽然上帝没有给我们任何答案
And while God may not give us any answers,

673
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,640
他却赋予了我们爱的能力
he has given us the capacity for love.

674
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,330
我们要做的就是去爱他
Our job is to love him

675
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,090
不去质疑他的安排
without questioning his plan.

676
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,700
所以我恳求您  亲爱的主啊
So I pray to you, dear Lord,

677
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,480
我恳求您
I pray to you

678
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,380
加深我们对您的爱
to help strengthen our love for you

679
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,120
作为回报
and to embrace Dean and Leanne

680
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,130
用您的爱温暖迪恩和莉安
with the warmth of your love in return.

681
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,310
我还恳求您  帮助我们抵御恨意
And I pray that you will help us fend off hatred

682
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,640
让我们能真正地
so that we may all truly

683
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,120
全心全意信任您
trust in you with all our hearts

684
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,160
不倚靠自己的聪明
and lean not on our own understanding.

685
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,260
-阿门  -阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

686
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,030
你的工作是报道新闻  不是成为新闻
Your job is to report the news, not be the news.

687
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,220
我在推销我们报纸
I was promoting the paper.

688
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,960
你在推销佐伊・巴恩斯
You were promoting Zoe Barnes.

689
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,790
是因为我说我们叫你锤子吗
Is this about how I said we called you the hammer?

690
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,620
如果你是气这个
Because if that upset you,

691
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,420
-我道歉  -这不是重点
- I apologize. - You're missing the point.

692
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,170
我不希望你讲这里的任何事情
I don't want you talking about anything that happens here,

693
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,410
别提昵称  别提我们有多进步
not nicknames, not how progressive we are,

694
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,600
也别提我们是否适应网络时代
not whether we are adapting to the Internet.

695
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,900
你有任何关于这份报纸的想法
Any thoughts you have about this paper,

696
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,170
要么藏在心里  要么告诉我
you keep them to yourself, or you bring them to me.

697
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,540
你不能上国家电视台  然后
You don't get on national television and sp--

698
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,600
抱歉  我没想要
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to--

699
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,190
我说话的时候别插嘴
Don't interrupt when I'm talking.

700
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,470
你可以像对大人那样跟我说话  汤姆
You can speak to me like an adult, Tom.

701
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,210
不用把我当成小女孩一样教训
You don't have to lecture me like a little girl.

702
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,150
你还不配被当做大人
You haven't earned the right to be treated as an adult.

703
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,420
你以为几篇头版报道  在电视上露几次脸
You think a few front-page stories and some face time on TV

704
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,770
知名美国女记者  曾在《纽约时报》供职

705
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,770
你就是下一位朱迪・米勒了吗
makes you the next Judy Miller?

706
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,110
你还有很长的路要走
You've got a long way to go.

707
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,410
别这么傲慢
Don't be so arrogant.

708
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,890
你认为一个女人要求受到尊重
Okay, so you think when a woman asks to be treated with respect,

709
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,130
是傲慢吗
that's arrogance?

710
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,450
你是说我歧视女性吗
Are you accusing me of sexism?

711
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,740
只是说出我看到的而已
Just making an observation.

712
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,410
一个月不准上电视
No TV for a month.

713
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,050
-什么  -你没听错
- What? - You heard me.

714
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,620
不准接受采访
No interviews.

715
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,720
这不公平
That's completely unfair.

716
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,660
你想永远上不了电视吗
You want to make it no TV indefinitely?

717
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,800
好了  你可以走了
We're done. You can go now.

718
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,460
你好
Hello?

719
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,590
吉莉安  我是克莱尔・安德伍德
Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.

720
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,690
我能上来吗
Can I come up?

721
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,770
你看医生了吗
Have you seen a doctor?

722
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,590
贾弟虫病没那么严重
Giardia's not so bad.

723
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,040
再过一两周就好了
It'll pass in another week or so.

724
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,030
-你没有医疗保险吧  -没有
- You don't have health insurance, do you? - Nope.

725
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,390
我替你预约  你明天去看我的私人医生
I'll make an appointment for you to see my personal GP tomorrow.

726
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,820
药物没有多大作用
Medicine doesn't really do much.

727
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,030
得让它自己好起来
You have to let it run its course.

728
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,830
好吧  那就在适当监控下好起来吧
Well, we'll let it run its course under proper supervision.

729
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,800
别想拒绝我
I won't take no for an answer on this.

730
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,530
-克莱尔 -实在不行  我会亲自拖你去医院
- Claire--  - I'll drag you to the hospital myself if I have to.

731
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,970
你必须去看医生  就这么定了
You're going to the doctor. No argument.

732
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,800
谢谢
Thanks.

733
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,300
他们要走了  完全不听我说
They're about to walk. They won't listen to a word I say.

734
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,810
-两个工会都是吗  -是的
- Both unions? - Yeah.

735
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,040
让马蒂接电话
Put Marty on the phone.

736
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,000
稍等  马蒂
Hang on. Marty.

737
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,860
嗯  是弗兰克吗
Yeah. It's Frank?

738
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,810
这样不行  弗兰克
This isn't working, Frank.

739
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,780
马蒂  你必须让他们留在那里
Marty, you have got to keep them in that room.

740
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,860
他们都没耐心了
They lost their patience.

741
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,960
你不在他们不高兴  弗兰克
They're upset you're not in the room, Frank.

742
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,050
-我下午就回去  -不行  太迟了
- I'll be back this afternoon. - No, it's too late.

743
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,140
听着  告诉他们
Look, tell them

744
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,800
特许学校津贴的事我会妥协
I'll come down on subsidies for charter schools.

745
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,880
即使如此
Even so,

746
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,540
他们对绩效标准非常不满
they're angry about the performance standards.

747
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,980
这还没进行到一半呢
We're not even halfway through this thing.

748
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,160
有许多内容他们
There's so much in it that they--

749
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,420
告诉他们  绩效标准可以商量
Tell them that I'll roll over on performance standards,

750
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,950
频率定为五年一次
five-year intervals.

751
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,230
应该由你来告诉他们  弗兰克
It should be you telling them that, Frank,

752
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,260
你亲自坐在谈判桌前
you here, at this table.

753
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,290
我知道  我在尽我所能
I know that. I'm doing the best I can,

754
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,330
但实在分身乏术
but I can't be in two places at once.

755
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,640
听着  我向你保证
Now, look. I promise you,

756
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,950
如果你把他们留在那里
if you keep them in that room,

757
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,760
我一回去  我们就能克服这个大障碍
we will get through this hump as soon as I get back.

758
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,730
马蒂  你是他们的说客
Marty, you are their lobbyist.

759
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,100
知道什么对他们最好
You know what's best for them.

760
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,570
别让他们作茧自缚
Save them from themselves.

761
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,940
好吧  我想想办法吧
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

762
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,450
斯坦普
Stamper.

763
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,590
死死盯住斯比奈拉
Do not let Spinella out of your sight

764
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,230
有必要的话  就把门锁上
and lock the goddamn doors if you have to.

765
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,360
没问题
You got it.

766
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,970
来了
Here we go.

767
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,940
我知道你是个大忙人  希望我们没妨碍你
I know you're a busy man. I hope we're not keeping you.

768
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,460
不不不  我有的是时间
No, no, no, I've got all the time in the world.

769
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,680
这是鸡肉  这些是火鸡肉
This is ham and these are turkey.

770
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,620
还有些土豆沙拉
And there's some potato salad.

771
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,170
我们做祷告吧
Shall we have a prayer?

772
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,960
仁慈博爱的上帝
Gracious loving God...

773
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,010
你之前得过这种病吗
Have you had this before?

774
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,300
第三次了  我都习惯了
This is the third time. I'm used to it by now.

775
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,640
也不是习惯啦  但比疟疾好受多了
Well, I'm not used to it, but it beats malaria.

776
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,900
你还得过疟疾
You've had malaria.

777
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,040
在津巴布韦时
In Zimbabwe.

778
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
病倒一个月
That took me out for a month.

779
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,730
你牺牲了很多啊
You make a lot of sacrifices.

780
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,980
我并不觉得是牺牲
I don't see it as a sacrifice.

781
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,820
你拒绝了谷歌六位数薪水的工作
You turned down a six-figure salary at Google

782
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,980
却做起非营利事业
to start your own non-profit.

783
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,800
在帕洛阿尔托可不会得疟疾
People don't get malaria in Palo Alto.

784
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,320
你做了功课啊
You do your research.

785
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,210
对我在乎的人自然上心
When it's someone I care about.

786
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,470
克莱尔  我拒绝那份工作
Claire, I turned down that job

787
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,180
是因为那样我会恨我自己
because I would've hated myself.

788
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,240
是有很多钱  但为了什么呢
It was a lot of money, but for what?

789
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,800
好让他们用一个上过斯坦福的
So they could fulfill their diversity quota

790
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,130
亚裔女孩来增加公司的多样性吗
with an Asian girl peddling a Stanford degree?

791
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,140
你不是普通的亚洲女孩
Not just any Asian girl.

792
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,000
即毕业时第一名

793
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,000
你致过告别词
A valedictorian.

794
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,280
我能给你谷歌给不了的
Let me offer you what Google couldn't.

我理解你
I know what it is

796
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,630
有能力长得又漂亮  还有雄心
to be capable and beautiful and ambitious

797
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,160
谷歌创始人

798
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,160
谢尔盖和拉里这种人想要你
and be on people like Sergey and Larry's

799
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,810
好用来装点门面
checklist of things that look good to have on a shelf.

800
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,400
我不是来买你的
I'm not trying to acquisition you.

801
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,690
我钦佩你
What I see in you is a woman I admire,

802
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,940
能让我钦佩的女人很少
which doesn't happen often.

803
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,980
我想给你施展的平台
I want to enable you.

804
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,770
我想帮你扫除障碍
I want to clear the way for you

805
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,640
让你能做你想做的事
so that you can achieve what you want to achieve,

806
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,930
按你自己的方式做
on your own terms.

807
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,820
谢谢你的茶
Thanks for the tea.

808
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,980
我明天会派辆车来接你去看医生
And I will send a car to pick you up for the doctor tomorrow.

809
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,500
等你感觉好一点
When you're back on your feet,

810
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,690
你觉得我们可以好好商量一下吗
do you think maybe we can work something out?

811
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,150
是的  我想可以
Yes, I think we could.

812
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,790
这是她在高二舞会上
That's her at junior prom.

813
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,560
真漂亮
Beautiful.

814
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,320
这是她穿着字母夹克衫
Here she is in her letter jacket.

815
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,660
她高一就进了校队
She made varsity as a freshman.

816
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,830
我还记得她知道消息的那一天
I remember the day she found out.

817
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,020
教练打来电话
Coach called.

818
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,790
杰西高兴得蹦了起来
Jessie starts jumping up and down.

819
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,080
"妈  你猜怎么"
"Mom, guess what?"

820
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,340
抱歉
I'm sorry.

821
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,490
不  没事的
Don't be. It's fine.

822
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,170
我们这是在干什么
Why are we doing this?

823
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,990
说真的  回忆这些有什么用
Honestly, what's to be gained in dredging up all this stuff?

824
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,510
回忆美好往事有时能帮助...
Remembering the good things helps sometimes--

825
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,500
让我妻子哭可不叫帮助
Not when it puts my wife in tears.

826
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,280
我感激你在教堂说的那番话
I appreciate what you said at the church,

827
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,050
但对我们没什么用
but it doesn't do us any good.

828
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,050
这也一样
Neither does this.

829
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,970
那我要怎么能帮你们呢
Well, what can I do to help?

830
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,530
你什么都做不了
You can't do anything.

831
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,880
她已经死了
She's gone.

832
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,040
你说得对  这我改变不了
You're right. I can't change that,

833
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,620
但我能确保
but I can make sure

834
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,410
让市政府给你们一笔可观的和解费
the city offers you a sizable settlement.

835
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,300
你是说收买我们
You mean buy us off?

836
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,820
不  我是说帮你们
No, I mean help you

837
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,820
避免旷日持久的官司
avoiding years of court battles.

838
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,740
杰西卡本来要去弗曼上大学  对吗
Jessica was going to go to Furman. Is that right?

839
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,560
她获得了排球奖学金
On a volleyball scholarship?

840
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,310
是的  全额奖学金
Yes, a full ride.

841
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,730
我今早和大学校长谈了
Well, I spoke to the president of the university this morning,

842
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,970
我们想以你女儿的名义创建一个新奖学金
and we'd like to create a new scholarship in your daughter's name.

843
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,990
如果你们愿意的话
If you'd like that.

844
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
这完全取决于你们
It's entirely up to you.

845
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,250
但最重要的是
But, most importantly,

846
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,820
我们必须确保这种事故再也不会发生
we have to make sure that this never happens again.

847
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,350
我们拉起了安全广告牌
We've got safety billboards going up,

848
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,490
晚上水塔也不会再亮灯了
we're going to stop lighting the tower at night,

849
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,720
并且在安装护栏
and we're putting the guard rails in.

850
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,890
在她冲下马路前  就该做好这些事
Should've done all that before she ran off the road.

851
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,830
你要我辞职吗  马斯特斯先生
Would you like me to resign, Mr. Masters?

852
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,050
你一句话  我立马辞
Just say the word, and it's done.

853
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,570
如果这能让你好过一点的话
If it will bring you any satisfaction.

854
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,500
我曾问过牧师
I asked the reverend once,

855
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,440
在这些无意义痛苦面前  我们该怎么做
"What are we supposed to do in the face of so much senseless pain?"

856
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,000
他告诉我
And he said to me,

857
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,440
"除了从无意义的事中
"What else can we do

858
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,970
尽力挖掘出一些有意义的东西
but take what seems meaningless

859
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,090
我们还能做什么呢"
and try to make something meaningful from it."

860
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,120
他是对的
He's right.

861
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,240
上帝就是这样
That's how God works--

862
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,830
通过我们发挥作用
through us.

863
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,310
你愿意让我帮助你吗
Will you let me work for you?

864
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,660
你要知道  我的老乡们
What you have to understand about my people

865
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,690
都是高尚的人
is that they are a noble people.

866
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,230
他们的自豪表现在谦逊中
Humility is their form of pride.

867
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,570
这是他们的力量  也是他们的缺陷
It is their strength, it is their weakness,

868
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,610
如果你能在他们面前保持谦卑
and if you can humble yourself before them,

869
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,670
他们会任你差遣
they will do anything you ask.

870
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,130
再跟我们说说奖学金的事
Tell us more about the scholarship.

871
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,850
你在干什么
What are you doing?

872
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,080
-工作  -什么工作
- Working. - On what?

873
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,990
军事基地整合委员会的事
The, uh, BRAC commission stuff.

874
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,360
我落进度了
I'm behind on it.

875
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,980
今天是周日
It's Sunday.

876
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,120
所以呢
So?

877
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,830
你周末一般不工作
You don't usually work on the weekend.

878
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,590
现在不是做了
Well, now I do.

879
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,290
厨房里有咖啡  你要吗
There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen. You want some?

880
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,470
彼得
Peter...

881
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,410
彼得
Peter.

882
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,120
如果我决定留下来
If I decide to stay,

883
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,950
也是因为我自己  不是因为你
it's because it's what I want, not what you want.

884
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,020
我知道
I understand.

885
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,960
你看的是哪份书面证词的草稿
Which draft are you reading of the written testimony?

886
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
你周四发过来的那份
The one you sent on Thursday.

887
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,670
周五我又做了点改动
I actually changed it on Friday.

888
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,720
我指给你看吧
Can I show you?

889
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,440
我想我们可以从工作数量入手
Yeah, I was thinking that we could start with job numbers

890
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,530
接着讲经济乘数
and then go to economic multipliers

891
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,770
而不是倒过来
instead of the other way around.

892
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,780
你觉得呢
What do you think?

893
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,970
改改看吧
Let's see what it looks like.

894
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,720
想象一下
Picture this--

895
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,960
一名17岁的女孩
A 17-year-old girl

896
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,690
以时速60英里驾驶汽车
traveling at 60 miles an hour

897
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,920
在空旷的路上突然失控
spins out of control in no traffic.

898
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,100
然后她撞上了护栏
She hits a guard rail.

899
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,120
但是  如果她系上了安全带
But if she's wearing her seatbelt,

900
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,100
而她确实系了
which she was,

901
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,040
而她的车没有沿着深沟翻了三次
and her car doesn't roll over three times down a 20-foot ditch,

902
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,520
而车的确翻了
which it did,

903
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,760
那么这名女孩现在还会活着
then that young woman is still alive.

904
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,220
但你知道吗
But you know what?

905
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,110
正因为郡长没有建造护栏
The county administrator didn't build those guard rails,

906
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,690
所以她死了
so now she's dead.

907
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,590
我们查了章程
We looked up the statute.

908
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,170
护栏是郡政府管的
Guard rails are under county supervision.

909
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,980
你们想倒打一耙吗
Are you trying to turn this around on me?

910
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,410
这还不止  奥林
That's not all, Orrin.

911
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,450
为了使用自己土地的便利而使用他人土地的权利

912
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,450
还有你的地役权
Your easement.

913
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,730
你看  山麓电网每隔几年
You see, every couple of years the Piedmont Electric,

914
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,010
就申请让输电线横穿加夫尼
they apply to bring power lines through Gaffney.

915
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,950
你这块地正好在路线之上
The route comes right through your lot.

916
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,170
我和吉恩每次都把这事压下
Now, Gene and I always fight them off.

917
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,900
但今年  他们要是再来申请
But this year, if they were to reapply, hmm...

918
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,030
政府强制征收
Eminent domain.

919
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,130
拆掉这么漂亮的房子  真是可惜
It would be such a shame to have to tear down this beautiful home.

920
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,600
见鬼去吧  弗兰克
Fuck you, Frank.

921
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,990
你休想跑到我家来  还一副你的地盘的样子
You can't just roll up on my property and act like you own it.

922
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,520
不  我可以
Oh, but I can.

923
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,840
我已经做了
We just did.

924
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,520
我赢得了这个选区11次选举
I've won this district 11 times.

925
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,890
你以为光凭运气和握手能做到吗
Do you think that's just luck and a firm handshake?

926
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,730
不过告诉你  我不喜欢报复人
But I'll tell you what. I'm not a vindictive person.

927
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,080
要是能达到共赢   我也不忍见任何人输
I don't like for anybody to lose if everybody can win,

928
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,540
所以  我帮你赢得第四选区的选举
so I'm going to help you get elected in the fourth.

929
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,460
你保住房子  我保住第五选区
You get to keep your house. I keep the fifth.

930
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,070
把大桃子抛到脑后  皆大欢喜
We put the Peachoid behind us, and everybody's happy.

931
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,130
你说呢
What do you say?

932
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,330
没关系  你好好考虑吧
Well, that's all right. You think about it.

933
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,090
我相信你会做出正确的选择
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

934
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,960
期待你成为国会的一员  奥林
Oh, and I'm looking forward to having you in congress, Orrin.

935
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,920
能在对立党派有个朋友总归是好事
It's always good to have friends on the other side of the aisle.

936
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,830
《晚间报道》邀请我去
I've been offered a spot on Nightline.

937
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,680
想听我的建议吗
You want my advice?

938
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,110
不是想  是非常需要
I don't want it. I need it.

939
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,570
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

940
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:30,980
好
Okay.

941
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,500
11点25  《晚间报道》正要开播
So 11:25. Nightline is about to come on.

942
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,400
数以百万计的观众在收看
Millions of people are watching.

943
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,330
你在哪  在家里吗
Where are you, home?

944
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,850
不是
No.

945
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,590
在演播厅吗
At the studio?

946
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,660
是的
Yes.

947
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,640
你看到了什么
And what do you see?

948
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,460
我看到灯光
I see lights.

949
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,810
我看到了摄像头
I see a camera.

950
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,970
上面的小红灯亮了
And that little red dot goes on.

951
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,480
告诉我你听到了什么
Tell me what you hear?

952
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,680
我听见自己的声音
I hear my voice.

953
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,860
观众呢  他们听到了什么
And those millions of people, what do they hear?

954
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,300
我的声音
My voice.

955
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,520
他们看到了什么
And what do they see?

956
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,890
我的脸
My face.

957
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,660
你并不需要我的建议
So you don't need my advice.

958
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,530
汉默施密特会发火的
Hammerschmidt's going to freak.

959
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,330
别在你不想被
You don't want to work anywhere

960
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,860
炒鱿鱼的地方工作  佐伊
you're not willing to get fired from, Zoe.

961
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,010
对我们这类人来说
Treading water's the same

962
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,470
勉强生存与死无异
as drowning for people like you and me.

963
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,110
祝好运  我会盯着你的
Good luck. I'll be watching.

964
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,150
-等等  -怎么了
- Hey, wait. - Yes?

965
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,380

When do you get back?

966
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,200
我回来时  你会知道的
When I get back, you'll know.

967
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,610

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,770

Welcome back, sir. Linda Vasquez called for you.

969
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,620
转告她  几小时后我会带着新消息找她
Tell her I'll call her in a couple hours with an update.

970
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,150
-好的  -先生 
- Very well. - Sir?

971
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,820
如果不需要别的  凯尔会保护你
Unless you need anything, Kyle has you covered.

972
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,690
不需要  回家吧
No, go home.

973
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,310
这周末你做得很好
You did well this weekend.

974
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,290
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

975
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,570
回家之前  能帮我做件事吗
Oh, and before you go home, can you do me a favor?

976
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:46,570
你能路过我家
Would you swing by my house

977
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,500
把这束花带给克莱尔吗
and make sure these get to Claire?

978
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,570
是  先生
Yes, sir.

979
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,290
先生  谢谢你对我的耐心
And thank you, sir, for being so patient.

980
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,660
好了
Okay.

981

■

982
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:55,110
美国的公立教育对所有人包括非法移民的子女都是完全免费的
这给财政造成极大的负担  因而教师的收入微薄
且美国中小学教育不主张用学生成绩来评定教学质量
所以教师是低薪但稳定的工作  这使得公立学校整体教学质量差
这也是剧中总统要进行改革的一个原因
但美国公立教育主要由州政府承办  与联邦政府无关
因为民主党总统最关心的医疗  教育  环保三件事中
医疗改革奥巴马已做过  环保老百姓不关心  才用教育讲故事

983
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:18,170
■

984
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:18,170
特许学校就是从政府得到拨款的私立学校
不像传统私立学校那样贵  而教育质量非常好
受美国家长欢迎  而教师工会就非常反对
剧中谈判过程中涉及到对教师进行考核  给特许学校拨款
都是工会非常反对的
美国教师工会的力量非常强大  对民主党有非常大的影响力
教育改革触动教师既得利益  必然受到来自教师工会的阻力

985
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:38,910

986
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:38,910
本集中提到的"选区"  是特指众议院的选区
美国参议员每州两名  每人任期6年
众议员任期为2年  每州人数根据各州人口按比例分配
一个州被划成若干选区  一个选区选出一个众议员
美国宪法这样的设计  迫使众议员关心选区事务
弗兰克与奥林最后的对话中提到the other side of aisle
国会议事时  两党各坐一边  中间隔着一个过道
所以常用这个短语表达对立党派
