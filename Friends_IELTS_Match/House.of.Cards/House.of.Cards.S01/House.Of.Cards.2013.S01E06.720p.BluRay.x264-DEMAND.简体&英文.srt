1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,410
国会让美国失望

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:29,360
全国教师罢工  集会抗议总统教育改革

3
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,230
罢工已持续近一个月
We're almost a month into the strike,

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,430
无数孩子待在家里不能上学
and we've got millions of kids stuck home from school.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,190
你会不会责怪白宫或国会
Do you blame the White House or Congress?

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,400
我个人并不同情那些老师
I personally have very little sympathy for the teachers.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,630
国会让教师失望

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,810
罢工已持续超过三周
We're over three weeks into this strike.

9
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,930
国家损失了几十亿美元
It's costing the country billions of dollars,

10
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,180
他们不提供解决方案  而是...
and instead of offering solutions--

11
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,580
表明立场和坐视不理
There's a big difference between

12
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,030
你们的工会榨干我们的税金

13
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,290
是两种截然不同的态度
taking a stand and sitting on your hands.

14
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,230
我不知道这叫不叫懦弱
I don't know whether to call it cowardice...

15
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,570
教师应该教书  回家吧

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,120
这是他的议程
It's his agenda,

17
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,690
问题在于他剽窃了合理的保守党思想
and the problem is that he stole sound, conservative ideas.

18
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,160
他唯一明智的决定
The only smart thing he's done

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,690
是抄袭了共和党的党章
is lift his platform from the republican platform.

20
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,390
我承认  琳达  我没料到会这样
I admit it, Linda. This got away from me.

21
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,410
但时间不能倒转  我们必须坚守阵地
But we can't turn back time. We have to hold our ground.

22
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,890
不管我们的支持率持续下滑吗
While our approval ratings continue to nosedive?

23
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,120
斯比奈拉和我多年来
Spinella and I worked together

24
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,170
合作完成了很多跟劳工相关的法案
for years on dozens of labor-related bills.

25
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,460
-我以为他会讲理  -你弄错了
- I thought he'd be reasonable. - You were wrong about that.

26
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,150
我没想到他会疯狂到发起罢工
Well, I didn't think he'd be insane enough to go on strike,

27
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,890
也没想到罢工会持续那么久
and I didn't think the strike would last this long.

28
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,460
那你就错了两次
So you've been wrong twice about this.

29
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,450
我为什么要相信你该坚守阵地
Why should I believe you're right about holding out?

30
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,780
我们为了绩效标准
We threatened collective bargaining

31
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,040
和特许学校拨款而要挟集体谈判
in order to get performance standards and charter funding.

32
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,680
这是我们的条件  我们的立场
That's the deal that we made. We took that stand.

33
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,810
我们现在妥协  就会一输到底
We lay down now, we lose it all.

34
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,990
法案将彻底失去改革性
There'll be no reform, just an empty bill.

35
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,790
这道理我明白  弗兰克  
I understand the logic, Frank,

36
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,920
但我们现在要控制损失
but we're in damage control now.

37
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,420
我们不能拆东墙补西墙
We can't close one wound by opening another.

38
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,540
但我们是民主党
But we're the democrats.

39
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,580
我们理应维护教师
We're the ones who are supposed to be defending the teachers.

40
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,960
鱼和熊掌  琳达
But you can't have it both ways, Linda.

41
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,870
你不能既要改革
You can't have the reform you want

42
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,290
又想让教师满意
and keep the teachers happy at the same time.

43
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,360
这你一开始就知道
You knew that when we started.

44
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,620
好  如果我们要选择
Okay, then if we have to choose,

45
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,440
我们选择让教师满意
we choose to keep the teachers happy.

46
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,860
这样不对  琳达  我们已经没退路了
That is a mistake, Linda. We've already crossed the rubicon.

47
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,230
实话跟你说  总统想修改法案
I'm telling you this-- the president wants to change the bill.

48
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,250
三周前就该这么做  我们没有
We should've done it three weeks ago. We didn't.

49
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,560
所以现在你必须改
So you have to do it now.

50
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,080
再给我点时间  琳达  拜托
Give me more time, Linda, please.

51
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,550
如果我能结束罢工
If I can break this strike

52
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,380
并保留法案的全部条款
and get everything we want in this bill,

53
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,520
你能不能说这比认输更好
can we agree that's preferable to folding?

54
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,830
当然  如果这真能做到...
Of course. If we can count on that--

55
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,310
那就再信我一星期
Then count on me for just one more week.

56
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,600
如果到时罢工还没结束  我就改法案
If the strike isn't over by then, I'll change the bill.

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,050
-弗兰克  -不  一星期  仅此而已  
- Frank-- - No. One more week. That's all.

58
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,270
这是最糟的处境
This is the worst possible position to be in.

59
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,610
如果我修改法案
If I water down the bill,

60
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,530
总统还是会认为我失败了
the president will still see me as a failure.

61
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,860
如果罢工一周内不结束
If the strike doesn't end in a week,

62
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,510
我等于把自己逼到墙角
I forced myself into a corner.

63
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,880
只有绝对的胜利才能让我重获他的青睐
Only total victory will put me back in his good graces.

64
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,700
否则就是出局
The alternative is exile,

65
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,980
那么过去五个月都白费了
which would mean the last five months were for nothing.

66
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,800
我绝不能跌回原地
I cannot abide falling back to square one.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,870
议员找我吗  太太
Does congressman need me, ma'am?

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,150
不是  我只是想问你要不要来杯咖啡
No. I just was wondering if you wanted a cup of coffee.

69
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,750
我刚烧好一壶
I just brewed a fresh pot.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,040
-不用了  太太  谢谢  -你确定
- I'm good, ma'am. But thanks. - Are you sure?

71
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,390
再过几小时就换班了  我没事
My shift's done in a couple hours. I'll be fine.

72
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,800
进来吧  放松一下
No. Come on. Stretch your legs.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,410
别想拒绝我
I won't take no for an answer.

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,910
你做议员保镖前是干什么的
What did you do before you joined the leadership detail?

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,590
我是华盛顿的警察
I was a cop here in DC.

76
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,570
再之前  在海军陆战队  太太
Before that, I was in the Marines, ma'am.

77
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,310
-谢谢  -你在国外服过役吗
- Thank you. - Did you serve overseas?

78
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,030
是的  太太  巴林  还有阿富汗
I did, ma'am. Bahrain, then Afghanistan.

79
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,160
第二次驻派海外基本是在可兰山谷
Served most of my second tour in the Korangal Valley.

80
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,160
可兰山谷: 位于阿富汗  又称"死亡山谷"

81
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,010
您想问我有没有杀过人
You wanna know if I killed anyone?

82
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,920
我想我知道答案了
I think I know the answer.

83
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,480
我和博奇吃晚餐  我要
I got a dinner meeting with Birch. I'll be...

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,470
我请他进来喝杯咖啡
I invited him in for coffee.

85
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,220
快点喝  我们五分钟内就要走
Well, drink it fast. We leave in five...

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,300
趴下  别靠近窗口
Get down! Stay away from the windows!

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,500
站住
Stop!

88
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,360
我会派六名最好的手下24小时保护您
You'll have six of my best men covering you around the clock.

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,490
我好奇为什么现在保护我们的
I guess I'm wondering why we didn't at least have

90
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,530
没有一个是你最好的手下
one of your best men covering us now.

91
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,960
他会受处罚的  先生
He'll be disciplined, sir.

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,800
他在居民区开枪
He shot a gun in a residential neighborhood.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,990
-炒了他  -我们会进行彻底调查
- I want him fired. - There will be a full investigation,

94
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,960
我们会采取必要的措施
and we'll take the necessary action.

95
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,970
要是史蒂夫在就没这种事了
Steve never would've let this happen.

96
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,920
他好点了吗
Is he better yet?

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,070
他在的话我会安心许多
Because I would feel a lot safer if he was with us.

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,230
很遗憾  他不会回来了  先生
Unfortunately, he won't be coming back, sir.

99
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,060
我以为他只是胆囊感染
I thought he just had a gallbladder infection.

100
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,930
是的  但还有更重的问题
He did, but they found more.

101
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,520
胰腺癌晚期
His pancreas, stage four.

102
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,120
-天哪  -真可怕
- Jesus. - Oh, my God. That's awful.

103
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,610
他还能活多久
How much longer does he have?

104
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,860
不多  只有几周
Not long. A few weeks.

105
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,820
至少他妻子是这么说的
At least that's what his wife told me.

106
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,490
我们得去看看他  你能打听他在哪吗
We have to go see him. Can you get the information where he is?

107
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,170
当然  我查到马上告诉您
Of course. I'll make sure you get it right away.

108
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,570
-谢谢你  队长  -谢谢
- Thank you, Captain. - Thank you.

109
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,880
不用谢  晚安
You're welcome. Good night.

110
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,130
-前门  -是
- Front door. - Yes, sir.

111
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,500
武器给我
Your weapon.

112
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,000
还有徽章
Your badge too.

113
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,090
我被停职了吗
Am I suspended, sir?

114
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,280
嫌犯徒步逃跑  你居然开枪
You had a suspect on foot, and you fire your gun?

115
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,850
长官  我知道
Sir, I realize that--

116
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,300
你知道这让我多丢人吗
Do you know how this reflects on me?

117
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,690
我的手下这么没有分寸
That one of our men could be so careless?

118
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,250
你不仅擅自离岗去喝咖啡
Not only do you abandon your post for coffee...

119
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,400
你要是射伤路人呢
You could've killed a bystander.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,650
你的子弹打中别人前门
That slug was found in somebody's front stoop.

121
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,120
万一打进屋里了呢
What if it went in their house?

122
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,010
徽章  密查姆
Your badge, Meechum.

123
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,640
两个原因  其实都一样
Two reasons, which are really the same reason.

124
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,380
我受够给别人打工了
I was sick of working for other people,

125
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,080
而且我知道自己比老板更出色
and I knew I could do a better job than my bosses.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,940
他们总想打压我  排斥我
They kept trying to suppress me, shutting me out.

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,660
我就想  我按自己的方式来吧
So I said, "Fuck it. I'll do it my way."

128
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,040
-然后你就辞职了  -和你不一样
- Then you just quit? - Not like you did.

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,990
我忍到攒够钱开头条网才走的
I slaved away until I lined up the money to start Slugline.

130
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,390
头条网做大以后你有什么计划
Once Slugline gets big enough, what's the plan?

131
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,110
像阿里安娜那样卖掉它吗
Are you gonna sell it like Arianna?

132
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,110
阿里安娜・赫芬顿: 《赫芬顿邮报》网站创始人
该网站于2011年被美国在线以3亿1千5百万美元收购

133
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,980
可能吧  然后谁知道呢
Probably. And then who knows?

134
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,690
迎接任何新挑战  说不定会去上海
Whatever the next adventure is. Maybe Shanghai.

135
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,310
那么我得准备好两年后重新找工作咯
So I shouldn't expect to have a job in two years?

136
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,740
你真会愿意同一份工作干两年吗
Do you ever wanna have any job for more than two years?

137
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,630
你又有什么计划
What about you? What's your big plan?

138
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,530
还没想好
Uh, I don't know yet.

139
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,090
得了吧  头条网只是你的垫脚石
Come on. Slugline is just a stepping stone for you.

140
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,380
-我得去接一下这个  -快去吧
- You know what? I should take this. - Go. Do your thing.

141
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,430
你能证明是斯比奈拉指使的吗
Hey. You have proof Spinella was behind it?

142
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,300
写下来  全国教师罢工的第三周
Put it in context. Three weeks into a national teachers' strike--

143
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,920
法案负责人弗兰西斯・安德伍德议员家中...
At the home of Francis Underwood, who has led the charge on--

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,970
这就对了  赶快发布
There you go. Now post that

145
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,050
免得我邻居先打给了11点地方新闻
before one of my neighbors calls a local 11:00 hack.

146
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,550
我什么时候可以见你
When do I see you next?

147
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,550
我是此事的受害者  不是联络人
I'm background on this. I'm not your source.

148
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,410
你现在不方便吗
You can't talk now?

149
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,340
-不  -那什么时候方便
- No. - When?

150
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,700
很快我就会乐意见你
Soon, with bells on.

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,460
"多些书籍少点砖头"怎么样
What about "More school books, less bricks"?

152
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,320
太宽泛了  这一口要咬得准一点
Nah, it's too broad. We need a better sound bite.

153
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,100
要具体点
Something specific,

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,610
能直接把矛头指向斯比奈拉
something that points the finger directly at Spinella.

155
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,460
-他会否认与之有关  -他当然会
- He'll deny any involvement. - Of course he will.

156
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,970
所以我们该怎么说
So how do we get around that?

157
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,490
我们说他管不住他手下
We say he can't control his troops.

158
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,030
-没有证据表明那是老师  -不然会是谁
- There's no evidence it was a teacher. - Who else could it be?

159
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,200
他会把罢工的起因推回国会身上
He's gonna shift blame for the strike back on congress.

160
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,920
不行  我们的论点要简单  无可辩驳
No. We need something clear, something clean,

161
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,650
让人能记住
something that sticks in your head.

162
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,870
教师需要学会自制
"Teachers need a lesson in self-restraint."

163
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,100
不  你没懂我说的  大家都爱戴老师
No. You're not hearing me. People like teachers.

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,900
我们要让斯比奈拉做那个恶人
No. We need something that makes Spinella the villain.

165
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,880
-他的不作为  无能  -无组织劳工
- His lack of control, his inability-- - Disorganized labor.

166
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,790
显而易见  这是无组织劳工
It's disorganized labor, plain and simple.

167
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:25,220
罢工教师转向暴力

168
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,360
当愤怒的教师
When you've got angry teachers

169
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,450
开始朝国会议员的窗户扔砖头
throwing bricks through congressmen's windows,

170
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,570
工会领袖必须受谴责
you've gotta blame the union leadership.

171
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,440
我们将为所有高层议员增加安保
We'll be beefing up the security for the entire leadership.

172
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,750
我强烈建议马蒂・斯比奈拉
And I strongly encourage Marty Spinella

173
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,140
管好他的人
to keep his people in line.

174
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,910
现在变得像无组织劳工了
This is starting to look like disorganized labor.

175
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,690
你真的认为马蒂・斯比奈拉该对此负责吗
Do you really think Marty Spinella is to blame?

176
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,200
无论斯比奈拉先生是不是主使
Whether Mr. Spinella is behind this or not,

177
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,070
他应该少花功夫打花枪
he might wanna tone down the rhetoric

178
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,750
以免无组织劳工发展成有组织犯罪
before disorganized labor turns into organized crime.

179
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,240
没人拿得出证据  这是最有力的回应  
No one can prove anything. So that's the most cogent response.

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,660
那就上电视解释啊
Well, go on TV and say that.

181
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,310
你憎恶任何形式的暴力
You deplore violence in any form.

182
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,140
应当负责任的是国会
It's congress that should take responsibility.

183
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,630
我不想自贬到弗兰克的档次
I don't want to degenerate to Frank's level.

184
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,910
我们要解决砖头的事
We need to kill this brick thing.

185
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,710
否则人们的注意力都被转移了
It's distracting people from the issues.

186
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,720
-她说的对  -故事传一圈就没了
- She's right. - It'll eat up one cycle, and it'll disappear.

187
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,980
不  投砖事件越来越受瞩目
No. This story is getting traction.

188
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,680
罢工支持率正在下降
Support for the strike is dipping.

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,090
总统支持率不也是吗
So is the president's approval ratings.

190
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,780
不管怎样
But he gets to say in the

191
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,940
他还能继续执掌白宫三年
oval office another three years, no matter what.

192
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,690
我们可再拖不起三个星期了
We can't afford another three weeks.

193
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,850
我鼓动工会罢工时
When I told the unions to strike,

194
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,210
跟他们说了这会是持久战
I told them to prepare for the long haul, all right?

195
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,380
即使把他们拖穷了  我们也得继续
Their accounts dry up, we keep going.

196
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,370
我们会想出办法的
We figure it out.

197
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,800
这事我不能就这么不清不楚地认了
I am not going to blink over something like this.

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,480
话是这么说  但我们要是输了公关
Fine. But if we lose the public relations battle,

199
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,980
再坚持又有什么用
none of that does us any good.

200
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,580
弗兰克想迫使我们采取防守
Frank wants us on the defensive.

201
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,420
我认为投砖事件会平息的
I think this story is going to blow over.

202
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,690
要是我错了  我们再做定夺
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.

203
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,180
但我想再坚持一两天  好吗
But I wanna give it another day or two first. Okay?

204
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
亚当
Hi, Adam.

205
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,170
你没事吧  我看了新闻
You all right? I saw the news.

206
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,350
我没事
Yes, I'm fine.

207
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,820
肯定让人很不安吧
That's gotta rattle the nerves--

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,360
砖头从窗户砸了进来
a brick coming through the window.

209
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,050
是有点
It did, some.

210
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,900
你现在还住在家里吗
So are you staying in the house?

211
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,480
已经加派了保安  所以...
We've got extra security now, so...

212
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,650
我挺担心的
Well, um, it made me think of you,

213
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,450
就想打电话问候一声
so I figured I'd just check in.

214
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,760
谢谢你了
I appreciate that.

215
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,030
我们还没谈呢
We still haven't talked, have we?

216
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,460
-没必要谈了  -我觉得要的
- There's no need to. - I think we should.

217
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,840
我是这么想的
Here's how I see it.

218
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,760
你要我过去  我就去了
You asked me to come down. I did.

219
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,440
我们各自对此有自己的想法
We both had ideas about what that could mean.

220
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,730
或许还很相像
Probably very similar ideas.

221
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,630
但随后你又改了主意
But then you changed your mind.

222
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,420
顺其自然吧
So be it.

223
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,050
我们没理由不能保持联络  继续做朋友
There's no reason we can't be in touch or remain friends.

224
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,380
我们不要再自欺欺人了  亚当
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.

225
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,520
那我不能再打给你了吗
So I won't call again.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,190
-就此结束  -我不是这个意思
- Done. - I'm not saying that.

227
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,320
那你什么意思
What are you saying?

228
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,600
我关心你才给你打电话
I just called because I care about you.

229
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,980
没别的意思
No agenda.

230
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,660
你要想跟我说话  打给我
If you wanna talk again, call me.

231
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,080
不想打  我能理解  都随你
If not, I understand. It's up to you.

232
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,760
你觉得我是无理取闹了
You think I'm being unreasonable?

233
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,970
我觉得你在做你该做的事
I think you're doing whatever it is you need to do,

234
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,360
我不会提出质疑
and I'm not gonna question it.

235
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,220
谢谢你打来问候我
It was sweet of you to call.

236
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,130
你大概得继续工作了
Listen, you probably need to get back to work.

237
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,010
反正我是的  我得挂了
I know I do. I should go.

238
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,870
好的
Yeah. Okay.

239
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,180
-保重  -好的
- Take care. - Okay.

240
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,090
-弗兰克  有空吗  -你们先走吧
- Frank, you got a minute? - I'll see you inside.

241
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,180
我想做州长  并且需要你帮忙
I wanna be governor, and I want your help.

242
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,710
-我还是候选人吗  -是的
- Am I still on the short list? - You are.

243
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,430
我已经一个多月没喝酒了  我戒了
I haven't had a drink in over a month. I'm clean.

244
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,220
是因为我的要求  还是你自己的意愿
Is that because I asked, or because it's what you want?

245
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,440
我也该对自己负责了
It was about time I took responsibility for myself.

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,570
对自己负责是一回事  令人敬佩
Taking responsibility is one thing, and it's admirable.

247
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,350
但竞选大州州长  则是另一副局面了
But running for governor of a major state is a whole other ball game.

248
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,470
听我说  弗兰克
Let me tell you something, Frank.

249
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,380
我能成为国会议员
I got elected to congress

250
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,820
就是因为我抓住了机遇
'cause I seized the moment that opportunity struck.

251
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,090
你把我留在了候选人名单上
You kept me on that list.

252
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,970
我想抓住这次机会
I wanna seize that opportunity.

253
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,940
如果你能帮我  我会倾尽全力
If you help me out, I'll give you everything I got.

254
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,530
要的就是这种气概
Well, that's all I've been waiting to hear.

255
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,520
好的  听我说
All right. I'll tell you what.

256
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,390
我还要打些电话  找人落实情况
I need to make some calls, check in with some people.

257
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,800
容我几天时间  我再联络你
Give me a few days. I'll get back to you.

258
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
-好的  -还有  彼得...
- Of course. - And, Peter...

259
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,930
我觉得我这才第一次见到真实的你
I feel like I've met the real you for the first time just now.

260
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,380
珍妮特
Janet.

261
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,770
-来得不巧吗  -没事
- Is this a bad time? - No.

262
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,010
没关系的
No, not at all.

263
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,140
抱歉  我都不知道你要来
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming.

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,100
来  坐我的椅子
Here. Take my chair.

265
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,630
-不用了  没事  -我把这放好
- Oh, no. I'm fine. - I'll take these.

266
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,790
谢谢你
Thank you.

267
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,940
你好  史蒂夫
Hello, Steve.

268
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,910
我去给花添水  马上回来
These could use some water. I'll be right back.

269
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,420
听说你的病情  弗兰西斯和我都很难过
Francis and I were so upset when we heard.

270
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,940
非常抱歉没能早点来探望
I'm sorry I haven't come sooner.

271
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,100
我不想太多人知道
I didn't want too many people knowing.

272
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,900
也是
Yes.

273
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,260
弗兰西斯也想来
Francis wishes he could be here.

274
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,450
他想让你知道他在为你祈福
He wants you to know he's praying for you.

275
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,550
来不了  是吧
Couldn't make it, huh?

276
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,740
是啊  眼下正有场教师大罢工
No, there's a big teachers' strike going on right now,

277
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,100
他已经在办公室里忙了几周了
and he's been stuck in his office for weeks.

278
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,940
我理解  在新闻上看到了
I get it. I saw on the news.

279
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,030
-砸砖事件  -对
- The brick. - Right.

280
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,310
我跟弗兰西斯说
I told Francis that

281
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,830
要是你在就没这种事了
probably wouldn't have happened if you were there.

282
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,010
对  或许吧
No. Probably not.

283
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,750
我从没见过他祈祷
I never seen him pray.

284
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,410
这八年从来没有
Not in eight years.

285
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,850
你刚才说  他在为我祈祷
You said he was praying for me.

286
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,100
你见过我们上教堂啊
You've seen us in church.

287
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,940
确实  但是...
Yeah, but...

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,700
我从没进去过
I never went inside.

289
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,640
这些花太美了
They're just gorgeous.

290
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,530
安德伍德太太  非常感谢
Mrs. Underwood, thank you so much.

291

他们扔的是泡沫  我们是来真的

307
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,280
我们会显得像坏人

然后进屋  我想给你搽点粉
Then come in here. I wanna put powder on you.

322

演播室那边的人会干的

是  但他们总搽得太多  我来

战争妆容

325
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,270
你觉得会有多激烈
How bloody do you think it'll be?

326
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,800
我觉得我很轻易就能了结他
Oh, I think I oughta be able to dispatch with him easily enough.

327
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
你记得彼得・罗素吗
Oh, you remember Peter Russo?

328
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,990
他干得不错  一个月滴酒不沾

我们想在他选区创造工作岗位

334
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,720
在特拉华河上
It's on the Delaware River.

335
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,420
我想我们或许能弄个法案出来
I thought we might be able to put a bill together.

336
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,840
对经济有促动的
Something with an economic upside.

337
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,740
这件事和造船厂倒闭有关吗
This has to do with the shipyard closing?

338
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,980
我们需要造船厂协会支持他的竞选
We need the shipbuilders' support for his campaign.

339
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,900
你觉得你能起草一个法案

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,310
我现在的重心在国际项目上  弗兰西斯
I'm really trying to focus on international projects, Francis.

342
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,960
而不是国内立法
Not domestic legislation.

343
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
我知道  但我真的需要你的帮助  克莱尔
I understand, but I could really use your help, Claire.

344
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,550
凯瑟琳・杜兰特还欠我们人情吗
Does Catherine Durant still owe us?

345
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,170
你帮谁当上国务卿
When you make someone Secretary of State,

346
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,260
他们这辈子都欠你的
they owe you for life.

347
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,590
我们的滤水器卡在了苏丹海关那里
We're having trouble getting our water filters through Sudanese customs.

348
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,900
-我在车上给她打电话  -明天也不迟
- I'll call from the car. - Tomorrow's fine.

349
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,250
-反正我也会打  -我知道

350
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,370
我准备好上"战场"了
I'm ready for battle.

351

-不用了  你去吧  -来吧
- No. You go on ahead. - Oh, come on.

353
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,840
看我给败军致命的一击
Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.

354
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,720
很好玩的
It'll be fun.

355
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
马蒂
Marty.

356
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,700
弗兰克
Frank.

357
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,450
议员先生  你想对此做出回应吗
Congressman, would you like to respond to that?

358
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,340
我会的
Yes, I would.

359
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:48,270
全国教师罢工

360
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,130
浪费了纳税人二十亿美元
Two billion dollars of taxpayer's money being wasted.

361
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,460
国会真该感到羞愧啊  弗兰克
And congress should be ashamed of itself for that, Frank.

362
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,930
怎么  国会强迫教师罢工了吗  马蒂
Oh, what? Did congress force the teachers to go on strike, Marty?

363
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,390
-不  没有  -是吗  弗兰克
- No, we didn't. - Really, Frank?

364
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,770
你拿教师的集体谈判权相要挟
When you threaten teachers' ability to negotiate as a union,

365
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,800
你威胁他们的工作保障
when you threaten their job security,

366
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,540
你就威胁到了他们的生计
you threaten their livelihood,

367
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,340
当然是你迫使他们起来罢工的
of course you force them to strike.

368
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,560
那我们还迫使他们
And did we also force them

369
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,730
朝人家房子里投砖块吗
to start throwing bricks at people's houses?

370
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,670
我很高兴你提到了这事
You know what? I'm really glad you brought that up,

371
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,360
你明明知道完全没有证据
because you know there's absolutely no proof

372
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,480
证明投砖事件与罢工有任何关系
that that incident had anything to do with this strike.

373
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,900
我想借此机会公开声明
And I wanna take the opportunity to say publicly

374
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,990
我们绝对谴责
that we categorically condemn

375
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,560
任何暴力或恐吓行为
any use of violence whatsoever or intimidation.

376
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,000
你说的不就是
What you're saying essentially

377
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,030
你对你的人领导不力吗
is that you can't control your own people.

378
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,760
我不是这个意思
That is not what I'm saying.

379
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,770
你就是这意思  你的人缺乏组织
That is what you're saying. You're disorganized.

380
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,480
无组织劳工
Disorganized labor.

381
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,510
随你继续重复那个词
You can keep trotting out that phrase all you like,

382
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,360
但你知道我想做什么吗  弗兰克
but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?

383
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,800
我想回到孩子们的教育问题上来
I would like to get back to the issue here of educating our children

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,650
回到国会没有尽职的问题上来
and the fact that congress is not living up to their commitment.

385
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,260
你知道我想要什么吗
Well, you know what I would like?

386
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,520
什么
What?

387
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,470
一个道歉
An apology.

388
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,730
即使不向我道歉  那就向我妻子道歉
If not to me, then to my wife.

389
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,080
砖头砸破我家窗户时  非常吓人
When that brick came through our window, it was terrifying.

390
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,700
她现在就站在那儿
She's standing right over there.

391
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,460
-克莱尔  -把镜头对准议员妻子
- Claire? - We need camera two on the wife.

392
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,070
你能直视她的眼睛
Now, why don't you look her in the eye

393
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,570
告诉她你的手下与投砖事件无关吗
and tell her that your people had nothing to do with that brick?

394
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,090
-你是认真的吗  -是的
- Are you serious? - Yes.

395
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,720
好吧
Okay.

396
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,940
安德伍德太太  克莱尔
Mrs. Underwood, Claire,

397
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,770
我真的非常抱歉
I am sincerely sorry

398
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,830
你得经历那样的事
that you had to go through that ordeal, truly.

399
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,390
这事令我生厌
And it actually sickens me

400
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,880
竟然有人让你在自己家感到不安
that someone made you feel unsafe in your own home.

401
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,240
我向你保证  据我所知
And I give you my word that to the best of my knowledge,

402
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,390
我的手下  与此事无关
none of our people had anything to do with it.

403
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,660
你知道我更感到厌恶的是什么吗
But you know what sickens me more?

404
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,780
就是此时此刻  你丈夫居然想利用你
That right now, your husband is using you as a prop

405
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,530
来赢得国家电视台上的辩论
on national television to try and win a debate.

406
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,800
所以我觉得你才该向你妻子道歉  弗兰克
So I think you're the one that owes your wife an apology, Frank.

407
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,240
等你道过歉
And when you're done apologizing,

408
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,660
我们可以回到教育问题上来吗
can we please get back to the issue here of educating our children?

409
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,030
你搞错了  马蒂
No. You've got this wrong, Marty.

410
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,940
教育中没有"你"和"我"
There is no "You" And "I" in education.

411
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,360
"教育"一词里是有
Well, I mean, yes, there's the letters

412
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,090
"U"和"I"这两个字母
"U" and "I" are in the word "Education."

413
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,230
但以E开头的"教育"...
But "Education" with a capital E...

414
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,040
你懂我的意思
You know what I'm talking about.

415
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,650
我不知道
I don't think I do.

416
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,660
不  你知道的  马蒂
Yes, you do, Marty.

417
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,640
U和I  教育
U and I-- Education.

418
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,390
怎么  接下来的辩论
So, what, we're gonna waste the

419
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,640
要浪费在念"教育"的元音字母上吗
rest of this debate naming all the vowels in--

420
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,050
我很愿意玩元音字母游戏
I'm happy to play the vowel game.

421
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,290
你想玩玩吗
You wanna play the vowel game with me?

422
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,530
好的  你觉得我欠
All right. U think I O

423
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,980
你一个道歉
U A apology.

424
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,210
但你搞错了
But no, no, no.

425
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,860
你欠我...
U o I...

426
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,110
有意思  你漏掉了"教育"里的E
Interesting. You left out E for "Education."

427
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,660
-所以还是...  -澄清
- So let-- - Defecation--

428
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,630
启迪  抱歉  哈哈
Edification. I'm sorry. LOL.

429
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,140
你这么喜欢《芝麻街》[美国知名儿童节目]
You like sesame street so much?

430
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,770
怎么不把孩子们应得的钱还给他们
Why don't you give the kids the money they deserve?

431
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,860
我想说的是...教育...
What I'm trying to say about education...

432
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,670
嗯
Well,

433
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,460
看来学校没停课
I guess school's still in session.

434
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,780
你倒给我上了一课  马蒂
I guess you schooled me there, Marty.

435
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,740
请继续吧
Let's move on. Please.

436
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,850
撇开笑谈  还有许多重要议题
Humor aside, there are more important issues out there.

好吧  长话短说  密查姆
All right. Make it fast, Meechum.

496
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,790
要我开这个口很不容易
It's not easy for me to ask this,

497
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,580
但我想您能否跟我们头儿说点好话
but I was wondering if you could put in a good word with my boss.

498
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,560

503
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,860
就个人而言  我对你没意见  密查姆
Look, I have nothing against you personally, Meechum,

504
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,650
但我不能掺和到这些事里去

505
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,850
规矩就是规矩
There's protocols and rules.

506
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,050
先生  求您了  如果您和卡迪夫谈

507
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,930
我无能为力
There is nothing that I can do.

508
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,500
如果有谁能说服队长
If anyone can convince the captain,

509
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,690
那一定就是您了  议员
it would be you, Congressman.

巴尼・豪尔怎么说
What did Barney Hull say?

513
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440
我们会在第一时间知道
That we'd be the first to know.

514

真不敢相信到现在都没报警电话

516

只是没有我们要的那种

518
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,320
不  必须得在这里  我不能坐飞机
No, it's got to be here. I can't be getting on a plane.

那样就太投机了
It looks too opportunistic.

520
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,760
或许我们该扩大点范围
Maybe if we open it up a little bit.

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,580
不  我们不能降低标准
No, we cannot lower our standards.

522

再耐心等等
We just have to be patient.

Frank Underwood has to tell us what the hell that was.

526
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,250
说真的  议员  你是在搞笑吗
Seriously, Congressman, was that a joke?

527

我很久没听过这样的东西了

551
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,210
很好  我们的首要任务
Good. The first thing we need to address

552
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,170

00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,870
我们的目标是通过特拉华河流域的法案
Our goal is to pass a watershed act for the Delaware River.

587
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,640
我们以不破坏环境的方式开发土地
We develop the land in an environmentally-responsible way,

588
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,220
同时创造就业岗位
creating jobs in the process.

589
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,280
-多少岗位  -上千个
- How many jobs? - Thousands.

590
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,640
目标收益两亿美元

我们有很多事要做
We got a lot of work to do.

592
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,340
没错  但你可以从
We do, but you can start

593
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,100
选区在流域内的议员入手
with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.

594
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,690
你能不能让我看下草案
Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?

595
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,130
我们从没发起过环境法规
We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.

596
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,920
我是史蒂夫  不要打电话  来看看我

597
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,980
草案等和你的同事商议后再定
We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.

598
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,770
吉莉安是我们这边的主负责人
Gillian will be the point person on our end.

599
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,490
我没有任何立法经验
I don't have any legislation experience.

600
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,830
-我会帮你  -什么时候开始
- I'll help you. - When do we start?

601
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,800
已经开始了
We just did.

602
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,570
麻烦向他介绍下调研团队
Will you introduce him to the research team?

603
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,270
-我一会儿就过去  -好
- I'll be there in one second. - Sure.

604
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,750
明天行吗

605
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,340
总统先生
Mr. President?

606
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,830
结束这一切
I want it over.

607
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,330
越快越好
As soon as possible.

608
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,310
修改法案  弗兰克
Gut the bill, Frank.

609
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,600
不惜一切代价结束罢工
Do whatever's necessary to end this.

610
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,370
总统先生  如果我们现在妥协
Mr. President, if we give in now,

611
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,210
公众不会认为你成功了
the public won't credit you with a victory.

612
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,460
连伪胜利都不算
Not even a hollow one.

613
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,560
他们会把这视做一次惨败
They'll chalk it up as a colossal defeat.

614
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,720
那是你的责任  弗兰克
Well, that's on you, Frank.

615
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,710
是你让事态一发不可收拾
You let this situation devolve to where it is.

616
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,460
我已经因为美国史上
I've already been blamed

617
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,640
规模最大的教师罢工而备受指摘
for the largest teacher's strike in US history.

618
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,150
我不能对它无休止的拖延而负责
I won't be held accountable for it dragging on months and months.

619
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,950
总统先生  只有您能终止罢工
Mr. President, we have to end this strike on your terms.

620
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,330
其他人都不行
Not anyone else's.

621
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,920
怎么做  在CNN和马蒂・斯比奈拉辩论吗
How? By debating Marty Spinella on CNN?

622
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,240
先生  您一直都很信任我
Sir, you have placed your faith in me thus far.

623
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,340
我恳求您一如既往
I would ask that you continue to do so.

624
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,050
不论你在做什么  弗兰克  都不奏效
Whatever you're doing, Frank, isn't working,

625
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,130
所以我要介入了
so I'm stepping in.

626
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,060
按琳达说的  修改法案
Gut the bill. Like Linda said.

627
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,900
不
No.

628
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,500
我很抱歉  总统先生  我做不到
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I will not do that.

629
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,060
你是不是被骄傲冲昏了头脑  弗兰克
Are you letting pride cloud your judgment, Frank?

630
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,250
恕我直言  先生
Respectfully, sir,

631
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,750
恐怕是您被恐惧冲昏了头脑
you're allowing fear to cloud yours.

632
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,980
对自由世界最有权势的人说不
Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man

633
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,140
可不容易
in the free world.

634
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,240
但有些时候  要想赢得上司的尊重
But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect

635
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,950
就只能违抗他
is to defy him.

636
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,130
日程表上还有什么安排  琳达
What do we have on the schedule, Linda?

637
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,300
您要会见...
Your meeting with the...

638
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,230
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

639
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,660
-提纲在你那儿吗  -在这儿
- Do you have my briefing? - Right here.

640
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,140
好  我们来浏览一下
Good. Let's look it over.

641
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,290
和彼得谈得怎么样
Hi. How'd it go with Peter?

642
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,990
还不错
It went well.

643
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,270
他投入吗
Is he game?

644
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,250
很投入
Completely.

645
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,620
太好了  谢谢
Ugh. Thank you.

646
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,580
可让我松了一口气
That's a big weight off my shoulders.

647
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,910
你听起来累坏了
You sound tired.

648
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,950
又累又烦躁
Tired. Impatient.

649
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,280
我能帮上什么忙吗
What can I do?

650
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,610
不用了  这事只能听天由命
Nothing. This one's up to fate.

651
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,590
我不喜欢听天由命
I don't like when we leave things to fate.

652
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,410
我也是
Neither do I.

653
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,050
那我今晚要独守空房了吗
Does that mean I'm gonna have the bed to myself tonight?

654
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,170
或许吧
Probably.

655
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,890
不能让道格独当一面吗
Can't Doug man the fort?

656
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,710
可以  但我肯定会辗转反侧
Well, he could, but I'd just toss and turn.

657
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,190
既然睡不着  还不如留在这儿工作
If I'm not gonna sleep, I might as well not sleep here.

658
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,820
我会开着手机
Well, I'll leave the ringer on.

659
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,170
想要人陪伴就打给我
Call me if you want company.

660
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,380
好的  晚安
I will. Good night.

661
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,450
晚安
Good night.

662
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,040
你回家吧  剩下的交给我就行了
You should go home. I can take it from here.

663
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,910
保持警醒  对灵魂有好处
Vigilance. It's good for the soul.

664
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,310
10-59  十六街与Q街拐角  10-59
10-59. Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.

665
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,790
什么事
What's that?

666
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,430
妨碍治安
Disorderly conduct.

667
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,650
你相信有因果报应吗
Do you believe in karma?

668
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,790
绝对不信
Absolutely not.

669
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,310
但我信
Well, I do.

670
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,710
起码今晚我信
At least tonight.

671
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,020
给卡迪夫队长打个电话
Get Captain Cardiff on the phone.

672
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,680
处理一下密查姆的事
Let's do something about Meechum.

673
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,760
怎么处理
What?

674
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,180
帮他保住饭碗
Get him his job back.

675
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,930
可他开枪了
He fired his weapon.

676
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,680
只是反应过度罢了
He overreacted.

677
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,290
立刻打给卡迪夫
Cardiff. On the phone. Now.

678
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,660
南茜  请帮我接卡迪夫队长
Nancy, give me Captain Cardiff, please.

679
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,780
反正也是干等  不如做点有用的事
We might as well do one productive thing while we wait.

680
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,390
这对我来说只是举手之劳
It requires very little of me

681
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,320
但对他却意义重大
and will mean the world to him.

682
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,910
是笔很划算的投资
It's a very inexpensive investment.

683
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,310
你好  先生  我是道格・斯坦普
Hello, sir. This is Doug Stamper.

弗兰西斯・安德伍德想和您谈谈
I have Francis Underwood for you.

队长  我知道很晚了
Captain, I know it's late,

687
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,330
但我想跟你谈谈艾德华・密查姆的事
but I'd like to talk to you about Edward Meechum.

688
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,690

饿了吗
Are you hungry?

691
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,660
进来的时候麻烦吗
You have any trouble getting in?

692
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,690
没  他们只是让我把吃的过了两遍安检
Nah, they made me put it through the X-ray machine twice.

693
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,890
希望没被烤焦
So I hope it didn't overcook it.

694
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,330
弗兰克  你总是多给  实在太多了
Frank, you always pay too much. This is way too much.

695
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,760
算是谢谢你送来
For the inconvenience.

696
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,950
你光顾我的小店都有二十年了
You know, 20 years you been coming to my joint.

697
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,020
这是我第一次到你工作的地方

00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,190
觉得怎么样
What do you think?

699
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,060
挺不错的
I could get used to it.

700
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,360
随时欢迎

别客气  弗兰克
Always, Frank.

703
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,860
第三街446...发生一起...  
Got a... 446 3rd Street...

704
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,800
是一起驾车枪击
That's a drive-by shooting.

705
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
查查详情
Get details.

706
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,440
先生  多谢您帮我向队长说情
Sir, I want to thank you for talking to the Captain.

707
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,490
他说您给他打了电话
He told me you called,

708
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,600
我对您感激不尽
and I can't tell you how grateful I am.

709
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,570
我希望你仔细听我要说的话
I want you to listen very closely to what I'm about to say.

710
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,140
从这一刻起  你就是一块石头
From this moment on, you are a rock.

711
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,140
万物不侵  丝毫不吐
You absorb nothing, you say nothing,

712
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,210
坚不可摧
and nothing breaks you.

713
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,750
-明白了吗  -是的  先生
- Is that clear? - Yes, sir.

714
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,290
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

715
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,210
史蒂夫

我先出去了
I'll leave you be.

717
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,470
珍妮特去哪了
Where, uh-- where's Janet?

718
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,270
过去几周她一直都守在这里
She's been here every day for the last few weeks.

719
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,740
我让她回家休息
I told her go home, get some rest.

720
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,030
一切还好吗
Well, is everything okay?

721
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,070
你发短信说很重要
Your text said it was important.

722
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,670
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know how to put this.

723
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,860
就是  我
The thing is, I...

724
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,110
我想了
I've been thinking...

725
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,270
很多
a lot.

726
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,640
想我这辈子
About my life.

727
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,890
想我还未完成的事
About the things I haven't done.

728
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,390
还没来得及说的话
Things I haven't said.

729
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,810
我恨你丈夫
I hate your husband.

730
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,170
很多人都恨他
A lot of people do.

731
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,410
过去八年  我一直守着他
The past eight years, I watched over him.

732
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,390
但我看的并不是他
But it wasn't him I was watching.

733
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,720
每次我看到你
And every time I saw you,

734
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,310
听到你的声音
every time I heard your voice,

735
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,730
我想的都是
all I could think to myself was,

736
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,890
天哪  我真愿付出一切跟你在一起
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."

737
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,130
这种想法在我脑海中不知盘旋了多少次
I can't tell you how many times I thought about that.

738
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,880
你知道弗兰西斯向我求婚时说了什么吗
You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?

739
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,000
他说的每个字我都记得
I remember his exact words.

740
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,470
他说  克莱尔  如果你只想要幸福
He said, "Claire, if all you want is happiness,

741
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
那就拒绝吧
Say no.

742
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,180
我不会跟你生一堆孩子
I'm not gonna give you a couple of kids

743
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,680
然后数着日子等退休
and count the days until retirement.

744
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,510
我保证你免受这些痛苦
I promise you freedom from that.

745
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:25,010
也永远不会无聊
I promise you'll never be bored."

746
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,840
他是唯一一个...
You know, he was the only man--

747
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,550
有很多人向我求婚
and there were a lot of others who proposed.

748
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:36,570
但他是唯一一个懂我的
But he was the only one who understood me.

749
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,320
他没把我看作什么女神
He didn't put me on some pedestal.

750
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,640
他知道我不想受崇拜或者溺爱
He knew that I didn't want to be adored or coddled.

751
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,800
于是他拉起了我的手  为我戴上了戒指
So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.

752
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,720
因为他知道我会答应的
Because he knew I'd say yes.

753
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,060
他懂得如何获得他想要的东西
He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.

754
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,250
这是你想要的吗
Is this what you wanted?

755
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,340
你想要这样吗
Is that the way you wanted it?

756
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,560
停下  停下
Stop. Stop.

757
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,710
求你了  求你了  快停下
Please. Please. Stop.

758
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,700
别这样
Don't.

759
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,950
你跟我说了实话
You told me your truth.

760
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,310
现在你也了解我了
Now you know mine.

761
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,470
彼得・罗素

762
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,540
我是彼得
Hey, it's Peter.

763
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,120
我不指望你会打回来
I don't expect you to call me back,

764
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,560
但我想告诉你我昨晚决定戒酒了
but I wanted to let you know I stopped drinking last night,

765
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,190
今早还第一次去了嗜酒者互诫会
and I went to my first AA meeting this morning.

766
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,530
我要去找那些我曾伤害过的人做些弥补
Um, I'm supposed to reach out and make amends to those I've hurt.

767
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,970
但我打电话的真正原因
But I guess the real reason I called you

768
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,900
是想告诉你我爱你  也很想你
is just to say I love you and I miss you.

769
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,470
希望你一切都好
I hope you're well.

770
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,470
这是工作  不是娱乐
This is work, not play.

771
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,350
那你为什么亲自过来
Then why'd you bother coming over?

772
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,330
我本希望你赤身裸体地来开门
I was hoping you'd answer the door naked.

773
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,360
那是娱乐
That would be play.

774
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,160
那是劳逸结合
That would be work with a view.

775
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,720
抱歉让你失望了
Sorry to disappoint.

776
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720

如果泰勒的学校在上课

他就不会被错杀了
this senseless killing would have never taken place.

我们得即刻结束这场罢工
We need to end this strike now

让孩子们回到学校  那是他们该去的地方

以免此类悲剧再次发生

你说什么

我完全没有跟你达成妥协的意思

00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,460
那为什么让我来  弗兰克
So then why the fuck are we here, Frank?

819
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,460

这些人都是有家要养的
These are real people with families to feed.

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,910
能别敲了吗
Would you please stop that?

00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,550

再数五秒钟  我就走

差别在于
But here's the difference--

我进入了国会  人们尊重我

而你  仍然狗屁不是

你就是个自负的意大利佬
You're just an uppity dago

837
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,560
穿件好衣服  为工会卖命

838
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,570
没人尊重工会了  马蒂
Nobody respects the unions anymore, Marty.

839
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,000
他们行将就木  也没有人尊重你
They're dying. And no one respects you.

840
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,800
你这辈子至多就是

你以为你能激怒我
You think you can get under my skin?

Kiss my ass, Frank.

你不敢走出去
You can't afford to walk out.

848
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:58,830
看我敢不敢
Watch me.

849

我手上有一个死去的贫困儿童
I've got a dead, underprivileged kid in my pocket.

850
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,610
你有什么
What do you have?

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,000
我有两百万尊敬的教师
I have 2 million honorable teachers.

852
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,440
说得好  但我还有更好的
Fair enough. But I got something even better.

853
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,370
来吧  打开它
Go ahead. Open it.

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,710
好
Okay.

855
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,330
我陪你玩
I'll play your game.

856
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,050
你是个白痴
You're an idiot.

857
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,590
斯坦普扔的
Stamper threw it.

858
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,360
你真是满嘴胡话
You're full of shit.

859
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,070
不  就是他扔的
Oh, no, Stamper threw the brick.

860
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,080
而且我让克莱尔把保安支开了
And I made sure Claire distracted my security.

861
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,010
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

862
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,650
想想你还让我向我妻子道歉
And to think you wanted me to apologize to my wife.

863
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:02,660
你真这么不择手段  弗兰克
You would do something that low, Frank?

864
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,450
我安排了砖块袭窗  马蒂
I arranged the brick, Marty,

865
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,640
就像我安排了这场会面
just like I arranged this meeting this afternoon.

866
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,780
退后  弗兰克
Back off, Frank.

867
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,750
你为什么不跪下来  那才是你该做的
Why don't you just get down on your knees where you really belong?

868
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,960
退后  弗兰克
Back off, Frank.

869
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,870
因为你唯一能从我这儿得到的东西
Because the only thing you're gonna get from me

870
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,920
-就是喷在...  -去你妈的
- is come on your-- - Fuck you!

871
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,490
里面没事吧
Everything okay in there?

872
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,640
听着  我会告诉他们是你挑衅我
Look, I'll-- I'll tell them you provoked me.

873
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,060
我会告诉他们是你亲自扔的砖块
I'll tell them that you threw the brick yourself.

874
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,690
谁会相信你呢
And who's going to believe you?

875
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,660
你刚刚袭击了美国国会议员
You just assaulted a United States congressman,

876
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,010
这可是重罪
which is a felony.

877
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,900
但我不会起诉你  马蒂
But I'm not gonna press charges, Marty.

878
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,670
因为罢工要即刻停止
Because the strike ends now.

879
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,470
你觉得会留疤吗
You think it'll leave a scar?

880
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,460
我脸皮厚
I have a thick skin.

881
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,820
下次你让我请人进门喝咖啡的时候
The next time you ask me to invite someone in for coffee,

882
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,420
务必确保没人会开枪  好吗
will you please make sure no guns go off?

883
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,660
我会尽我所能
I'll do my best.

884
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,670
我今天又去见了史蒂夫
I saw Steve again today.

885
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,840
他怎么样
How is he?

886
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,080
很痛苦
In a lot of pain.

887
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,780
我要去看望一下吗
Should I go see him?

888
