我是罗素  请留言
This is Russo. Please leave a message.

00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,570
他不接我电话
He's not answering my calls.

3
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,560
都结束了  他肯定明白
It's over, and he must know it.

4
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,920
你认为他不可能卷土重来了
You don't think there's any way he can recover?

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,780
共和党会在每个电台和电视台
The Republicans will play that interview

6
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,400
反复播放那段采访
on every radio and television station

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,270
从现在直到11月5日
from now until November 5th.

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,270
美国大选为11月第一个星期二  2012年大选是11月6号

9
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,590
我同情那个孩子
I sympathize with the kid,

10
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,240
但我从一开始就担心这个
but this was my concern from the beginning.

11
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,300
我该听你的  先生
And I should've listened to you, sir.

12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,560
我以为他能顶住压力
I thought he could handle the pressure.

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,630
好吧  他退出了
Okay. So he withdraws.

14
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,930
我们要找人代替他
We need to replace him.

15
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,420
你有人选吗
You have any ideas?

16
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,010
只剩不到两个月
With less than two months to go?

17
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
如果总统让我参与之前的讨论
If the President hadn't shut me out of the early discussions,

18
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,830
我没准能提出些好人选
I could've come up with some good options,

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,330
但我想不出有谁
but I don't know anyone

20
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,480
同时拥有知名度和金主捐款
who's got the name recognition and donor base

21
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,780
能够在七周内从零开始发起竞选
to start a campaign from scratch just seven weeks out.

22
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,100
让我想想
Let me think.

23
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,330
接下来的几分钟将决定一切
Everything hinges on the next few minutes...

24
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,940
我数月来的谋划  我走的每一步
all my months of planning, every move I've made.

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,870
-有一个人选  -谁
- There is one person. - Who?

26
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,560
你  副总统先生
You, Mr. Vice President.

27
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,780
如果你重新竞选州长    
If you ran to reclaim your seat,

28
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,330
一定能获得压倒性胜利
I think you'd win by a landslide.

29
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,770
辞去副总统职务
Resign the vice presidency.

30
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,880
赢了的话
Only if you win.

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,380
沃克2016年的大选需要我
Walker needs me for 2016.

32
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,760
你敢打包票他还会留着你吗
Are you entirely certain he's gonna keep you on the ticket?

33
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,450
你们二人的不和已不是秘密
I mean, it's no secret the two of you don't exactly get along.

34
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,160
他说什么了
What has he said?

35
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,280
你这不是让我难办吗  副总统先生
Oh, you're putting me in a very awkward position, Mr. Vice President.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,940
他有说我坏话吗
Has he been bad-mouthing me?

37
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,730
他的原话是
Well, the exact phrase he used was

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,750
"讨厌鬼"
"Pain in the ass."

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,500
那个混蛋
That fucker.

40
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,450
他缺乏领导力
He's got no idea how to lead,

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,070
不懂尊重
no sense of respect.

42
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,010
-是他的主意吗  -不
- Oh, is this his idea? - No.

43
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,370
-他想借机摆脱我  -不  是我昨天想到的
- His way of getting rid of me? - No. It struck me yesterday,

44
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,120
我觉得值得商榷
and I just thought it was worth suggesting.

45
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,970
但我还没和其他人讨论过
But, no, I haven't discussed this with anyone.

46
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,960
那就好
And you shouldn't.

47
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,800
没有人会傻到离开白宫去当州长
People don't leave the White House to become a governor.

48
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,950
我能问你个私人问题吗  先生
May I ask you a personal question, sir?

49
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,530
你真的想做副总统吗
Do you want to be the Vice President?

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,670
彼得说  你在帮他竞选拉票时
Peter said that when you were out on that campaign trail,

51
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,320
充满激情与活力
you had so much enthusiasm and energy

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,910
他以为你也许怀念做州长的日子
that he thought you maybe missed being the Governor.

53
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,620
的确
I do miss it.

54
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,800
那为什么不回去呢
Then why not go back?

55
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,820
你会成为这次竞选的英雄
You could be the hero of this election

56
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,600
在2016年大选中保住民主党在宾州的胜利
and secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats in 2016.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,390
加勒特不可能同意的
Garrett would never go along with something like this,

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,840
就算他恨我入骨
even if he hates my guts.

59
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,810
这会让他显得无力
It would make him look weak,

60
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,260
好像他控制不住自己的政府
like he's lost control of the administration.

61
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,970
如果这是双方的决定呢
Not if it was a mutual decision.

62
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,930
让我去找加勒特
Look, let me talk to Garrett.

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,170
我不会提及我们今天的谈话
I won't mention that we've spoken.

64
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,440
知道他怎么想也算有益无害
I suppose there's no harm in finding out what he thinks.

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,810
谢谢  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,200

68
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,520

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,310
彼得

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,380
六百分口号
Slogans for 600.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,010
彼得  在吗
Peter, are you here?

72
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,030
1888年  爷爷的帽子很适合本
"1888. Grandfather's hat fits Ben."

73
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,740
-克劳迪娅  -本杰明・哈里森
- Claudia. - Who is Benjamin Harrison.

74
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,740
-正确  -八百分总统竞选口号
- Yes. - Presidential slogans for 800.

75
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,400
1990年  晚餐吃得饱
"1900. The full dinner pail "

76
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,440
在火车上
On the train ride down,

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,280
我差点就要叫警察闯进来
I almost called the police to have them break in

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,880
看看你有没有伤害自己
and make sure you hadn't hurt yourself.

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,870
我不想问你发生了什么
I'm not gonna even ask you what happened.

80
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,630
现在无关紧要了
It doesn't matter right now.

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,040
1964年  "你心里知道他是对的"

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,670
现在要紧的是...
What matters right now...

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,180
-要紧的...  -戈德华特
- What matters... - Who is Goldwater.

84
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,590
-克劳迪娅  -戈德华特
- Claudia - Who is Goldwater.

85
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,260
巴里・戈德华特  正确
Barry Goldwater. Yes.

86
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,320
拜托  我正在看呢
Oh, come on. Hey, I'm watching that.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,060
要紧的是公寓外面的50个记者
What matters is the 50 reporters in front of your building

88
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,910
还有150名竞选工作人员
and the 150 campaign staffers

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,650
还不知道自己是否已经失业
who don't know if they still have a job.

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,890
都结束了
It's over.

91
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,700
我知道
I know.

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,100
让他们都走吧
So, tell them to go away.

93
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,590
怎么  你打算就这么窝在这儿
What, are you just gonna hole yourself up in here

94
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,480
希望一切都消失吗
and hope it all goes away?

95
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,780
差不多就是这样了
Yeah, that's pretty much the plan.

96
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,170
我不能让你这样
Well, I won't let you.

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,870
放下
Hey, put that down. Hey.

98
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,320
-给我放下  -彼得
- Hey, put that down! - Peter...

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,800
我们得发表个声明
We need to put out a statement.

100
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,570
准备好了打电话给我
Call me when you're prepared to do that.

101
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,640
我会在费城的总部
I'll be at the headquarters in Philly.

102
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,100
我怕我对你的感情变得太深
I was scared that I was starting to feel too much for you.

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,530
所以我才做了了断
I think that's why I ended it.

104
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,620
你不允许自己害怕吗
And you have no room for fear?

105
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,320
不  害怕成不了事
No. Being afraid doesn't accomplish anything.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,190
不对  我在海外时
That's not true. When I'm overseas,

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,540
合理的恐惧  像对疾病  暴力
rational fear... disease or violence...

108
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,490
这种恐惧让你生存下去
that sort of fear keeps you alive.

109
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,060
回到这儿  老天
Back here, God,

110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,070
我感觉自己害怕些
I find myself afraid of things

111
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,590
虚无缥缈的东西
that I can't name or point to.

112
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,370
就比如  我有多渺小
It's like, uh, how little am I seeing?

113
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,110
或者我是不是浪费了此时此日
Or have I wasted this day or this moment?

114
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,400
是啊  我有时也会想
Yeah, I think that sometimes...

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,440
我的人生到底有没有意义
whether my life will add up.

116
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,620
弗兰西斯听到我说这些
Francis would roll his eyes

117
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,240
一定会翻白眼
if he heard me talking like this.

118
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,000
他知道你在哪吗
Does he know where you are?

119
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,620
不知道
No, he doesn't.

120
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,300
如果他在找你  你就在那儿
If he's looking for you, that's where you are.

121
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,110
那里
Over there.

122
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,020
你遇见弗兰克之前
Before you met Frank.

123
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,270
独自一人
Alone.

124
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,990
充满好奇
Curious.

125
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,150
接纳一切事物
Absorbing everything.

126
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,080
你才不知道我年轻时是什么样的
You have no idea what I was like when I was a girl.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,590
他知道你的那一面吗
Did he ever know that side of you?

128
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,590
他对那女孩不感兴趣
He wasn't interested in that girl.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,960
我也是
And neither was I.

130
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,180
那你对什么感兴趣
What were you interested in?

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,130
不仅是观察别人
Being more than an observer.

132
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,590
你想受人瞩目
You wanted to be seen.

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,840
不只是受到瞩目
Not just seen.

134
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,340
我要举足轻重
I wanted to be significant.

135
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,240
历史上没有先例
There's no historical precedent.

136
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,980
阿伦・伯尔就曾竞选过州长
Aaron Burr ran for Governor,

137
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,030
卡尔霍恩也曾竞选过参议员
Calhoun for the Senate.

138
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,180
那都是两百年前的事了
200 years ago.

139
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,810
一个曾在决斗中杀人  另一个支持奴隶制
One shot a man in a duel, the other believed in slavery.

140
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,810
阿伦・伯尔在决斗中杀死了亚历山大・哈密尔顿
卡尔霍恩主张奴隶制度是完美的制度

141
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,090
我们真要跟这种人相比吗  弗兰克
Is that really the sort of company we wanna share, Frank?

142
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,740
总统先生  我们可能要
Mr. President, we stand losing

143
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,640
失去一个重要的摇摆州
control of an important swing state,

144
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,820
和议会多数党席位
our majority in the house,

145
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,100
甚至是您的连任
and quite possibly your second term in office.

146
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,290
要扭转局势就得采取非常手段
Preventing all of that may require unconventional measures.

147
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,720
别人会以为是我容不下他
It would look like I'm pushing him out.

148
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,630
或者更糟  以为他是抛弃了我们
Or worse... that he's abandoning the administration.

149
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,050
你们可以发布一份联合声明
You make a joint statement.

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,010
就说  除非竞选获胜  否则他不会辞职
You say he won't resign unless he wins.

151
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,900
而如果他输掉选举  就继续任副总统
If he loses, he stays on as Vice President.

152
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,190
这样就没人会指责你们背叛彼此了
No one could accuse either of you of disloyalty to the other.

153
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,390
这是吉姆的主意吗
Did Jim come to you with this?

154
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,960
不  这完全是我的想法
No. It's entirely my idea.

155
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
在得到您的首肯之前
I wouldn't dream of speaking to

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
我绝不会向副总统提及此事
the Vice President without passing it by you first.

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,870
我想他会很受冒犯
I think he'd take it as an affront,

158
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,840
好像我想摆脱他似的
like I'm trying to get rid of him.

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,020
老实说  先生  我倒觉得
Honestly, sir, I think

160
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,670
他对这事会比您想的感兴趣得多
he might be more interested than you imagine.

161
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,650
-为什么  -我本来不想提的
- Why is that? - Well, I hesitate to bring this up,

162
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,680
但在帮罗素宣传期间
but when he was campaigning for Russo,

163
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,210
他曾对您颇有微词  先生
he spoke quite freely about you, sir.

164
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,800
说说看
Tell me.

165
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,700
当然  我是听彼得转述的
Of course, I'm getting this secondhand from Peter,

166
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,520
但大概是说
but the gist of it is that...

167
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,440
说您完全没有领导力
that you lack entirely in leadership,

168
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,230
还不懂得尊重人
and that you have no sense of respect.

169
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,890
他还想承担更多责任呢
And he wants more responsibility.

170
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,500
这么口无遮拦  毫无自律
And how do I give him that when he shows

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,110
我怎么能给他重任呢
absolutely no discretion, no discipline?

172
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,320
这正是我想说的
Well, that is entirely my point. Now, look,

173
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,420
我为支持罗素竞选的事负全责
I take full responsibility for backing Russo,

174
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,000
但塞翁失马焉知非福
but there could be a silver lining in all this.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,930
也许您能一箭双雕
You could accomplish two goals:

176
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,460
为民主党保住宾州
Secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,580
又能名正言顺地换掉马修斯
and find an honorable way to replace Matthews.

178
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,370
你怎么看
What do you think?

179
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,800
我觉得事关重大
I think it is a very big decision,

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,810
最好三思而后行
and we do not want to make it impulsively.

181
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,100
我同意  我要再考虑考虑
I agree. I'd like to put some more thought into it.

182
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,130
这很谨慎  先生  不过别忘了
Well, that is very prudent, sir. Just bear in mind,

183
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,530
还有七周时间  我们得分秒必争
seven weeks out, that every day counts.

184
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,100
-你好  先生  -多少钱
- Hi, sir. - How much is it?

185
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,110
发票在我这儿
Oh, I got your receipt right here.

186
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,300
不不不  只要40美金
No, no, no. It was... it was just $40.

187
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,590
拿着吧  别告诉别人  行吗
Yeah. Don't tell anyone, all right?

188
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,410
我不会泄露住户的隐私
No. I... I never say anything about our tenants.

189
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,590
-记者还守在外面吗  -是的
- The press still outside? - Yeah.

190
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,560
我照你的吩咐  告诉他们你不在
I told them you weren't here, like you said.

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,130
多数都走了  但有几个还在外面
Most of them left. There's still, you know, a few, though.

192
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,350
有没有能让我
If I wanted to leave,

193
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,260
不声不响离开这儿的路
is there a place I could do it without being seen?

194
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,590
有  可以坐货梯直达车库
Yeah. The freight elevator down to the garage.

195
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
我可以叫辆出租车或是
I could call you a cab or...

196
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,140
好吧  谢谢  再说吧
All right. Thanks. I'll let you know.

197
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,900
罗素先生
Mr. Russo, uh...

198
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,160
算我多管闲事吧  不过
sir, it's none of my business,but, uh,

199
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,200
我叔叔也曾经酒瘾复发过
my uncle... he fell off the wagon a few times.

200
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,980
那时候最好的解决办法就是找个人陪着
When he did, the best thing for him was just not to be alone.

201
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,560
我把钱还你  把酒拿走
I'll give you this money back, I'll take that bag off your hands,

202
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,860
进去陪陪你
come in here, keep you company...

203
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,090
谢谢你  如果我改变主意会叫你的
I appreciate it. I'll let you know if I change my mind.

204
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,740
弗兰西斯・安德伍德  能过来一趟吗  我们得谈谈

205
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,150
坐吧
Sit down.

206
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,110
克莱尔在哪
Where's Claire?

207
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,070
不在这儿
Not here.

208
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,330
这是什么意思  除后患吗
So what is this, tying up loose ends?

209
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,900
我可不敢
I wouldn't presume.

210
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,210
你这样的人怎么可能除干净呢
People like you can't be neatly tied up.

211
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,920
我想或许我们可以...
But I thought perhaps we could start...

212
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
真有品味
It's very tasteful.

213
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,140
这是她庆典上穿的那件礼服
This is the dress she wore to the gala.

214
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,740
我想是的
I believe so.

215
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,170
就是的
It is.

216
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,050
我记得这件
I recognize it.

217
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,570
回卧室去
Go back into the bedroom.

218
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,520
这焦距对得真不错
I'm amazed how well you got her in focus.

219
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,000
叫她什么好呢
What should we call her?

220
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,000
她为什么一定要有名字
Why does she need a name?

221
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,310
我拍照一定要知道对方的名字
I never photograph anyone without knowing their name.

222
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,850
不是你拍的  我拍的
You didn't take the photograph. I did.

223
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,740
我觉得该叫她克莱尔
I think we should call her Claire.

224
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,000
她长得一点都不像我
She doesn't even look like me.

225
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,370
跟我年轻时也不像  你怎么老这么说啊
Not even a younger version. Why do you keep saying that?

226
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,750
不是指她的五官  而是表情
Not her features, her expression.

227
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,540
我们应该裱起来  你可以挂在家里
Hey, we should mount it. You can hang her in your house.

228
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,640
弗兰西斯会反对吗
Would Francis object?

229
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,630
我们能不能别提弗兰西斯
Can we please not discuss Francis?

230
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,830
是你在公园里先提起他的
You brought him up in the park.

231
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,970
我知道  我的错
I know I did, and I shouldn't have.

232
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,840
那我们得假装他不存在吗
So we have to pretend he doesn't exist?

233
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,490
我以为我们可以无话不谈
I thought we could talk about anything.

234
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,790
他其实就在这儿  你得承认这点
He is a presence here. You must admit that.

235
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,190
昨天你一进门
When you walked through the door yesterday,

236
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,070
他就和你一起来了
he walked right in with you.

237
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,220
只是我一个人  没有别人
It's just me, nobody else.

238
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,570
你就自欺欺人吧  说不定会成真
You keep telling yourself that, it might come true.

239
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,360
你觉得她要是知道我穿她的礼服  会怎么想
How do you think she'd feel if she knew I was wearing this?

240
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,180
我说不准
I don't know.

241
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,530
你不认为她会不高兴吗
You don't think she'd be upset?

242
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,870
她也许会说你穿起来很好看
She'd probably say you look very beautiful in it.

243
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,850
像钢一样
It's like steel.

244
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,940
你应该放回去
You should put it back.

245
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,200
我要了
I think I'll keep it.

246
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,110
如果你愿意的话  我可以为你买件一样
I'll buy you one of your own, if you'd like.

247
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,320
不用  我就要这件
No. I want this one.

248
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,320
她去过我卧室
She came into my bedroom.

249
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,390
她该知道我也来过她卧室
She should know I came into hers.

250
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,200
你们的床总是铺得这么整齐吗
Is your bed always so perfectly made?

251
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,560
这是我在军校养成的习惯
It's a habit I formed at military school.

252
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,050
她睡哪边
What side of the bed does she sleep on?

253
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,500
那边
That side.

254
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,290
让她留着吧
She can keep it.

255
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,360
反正也更适合她
Fits her better anyway.

256
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,860
听着  佐伊
Listen, Zoe...

257
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,240
不论是刚才楼上的事
Whatever just happened upstairs,

258
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,380
还是这过去的六个月的事
whatever these past six months have been,

259
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,460
现在是不是该简化这段关系了呢
can we agree that it is time to simplify?

260
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,510
怎么个简化法
What does simple look like?

261
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,460
像你之前说的那样  维持公事往来
We maintain our professional arrangement, as you suggested,

262
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,370
我会尊重你的决定
which I will honor.

263
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,340
你还信任我吗
You still trust me?

264
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,770
我还能怎么办
What choice do I have?

265
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,790
你没像你说的那样伤害我或者遗弃我
You didn't hurt me or discard me like you said you would.

266
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,450
我很庆幸没这必要
I'm glad I didn't have to.

267
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,160
那好  我们可以简化
Yes, we'll agree to simplify.

268
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,800
很好
Good.

269
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,520
抱歉我迟了几分钟  弗兰克
Sorry I'm a few minutes late, Frank.

270
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,720
请坐
Please, have a seat.

271
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,220
我想我很清楚你要见我的原因
I have a pretty good idea why you asked for this meeting.

272
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,110
-你和总统谈过了吗  -谈过了
- Have you and the President had a chance to speak? - We have.

273
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,690
-他什么意见  -他很纠结
- Is he leaning one way or another? - He's torn.

274
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,680
-你呢  -我没那么纠结
- And what about you? - I'm a little less torn.

275
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,520
直觉告诉我这是个错误
My instincts tell me it's a mistake.

276
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,440
你想要说服我吗
You wanna convince me otherwise?

277
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,780
听着  如果直觉告诉你
Well, look, if your instincts tell you

278
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,520
不应该这么做  我不打算...
this is not the way to go, I'm not about to...

279
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,290
弗兰克  我要问你两个很直白的问题
Frank, I'm gonna ask you two very direct questions,

280
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,530
希望你能直白地回答
and I would appreciate direct answers.

281
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,700
你把我儿子弄进大学时
When you got my son into college,

282
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,080
是不是就指着有这么一天
were you anticipating a moment like this?

283
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,880
什么意思
I don't follow.

284
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,680
真的吗  弗兰克
Honestly, Frank?

285
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,610
我指...
Was I antici...

286
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,720
我要是知道你想问什么
I would be happy to answer you directly

287
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,640
我一定直白地回答你
if I knew what you were asking.

288
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,330
好吧  我问第二个问题
All right. I will ask you my second question.

289
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,400
你是不是自己想当副总统
Do you want the Vice Presidency for yourself?

290
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,380
如果总统愿意委任于我  那是他...
I would serve at the pleasure of the President. That was his...

291
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,800
你提出这个建议就是为取代马修斯
You proposed this idea so that you can take Matthews' place.

292
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,430
-我可没说过  -但这是你想要的
- I did not say that. - But it is what you want.

293
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,020
-我想要...  -总统任命你为副总统
- What I want is in the... - The President makes you V.P.,

294
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,800
2016年你继续连任
he keeps you on the ticket in 2016,

295
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,550
再把这当成2020年竞选总统的跳板
and you use that as a springboard to run in 2020.

296
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,480
告诉我你从未想过这些
Tell me that trajectory has never entered your mind.

297
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,020
琳达  我习惯
Well, Linda, I make a habit of

298
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,750
考虑任何情况下可能发生的事
considering all trajectories in any given situation.

299
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,310
但这是为大局  不是为了我自己
But that's a practical exercise, not a personal one.

300
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,230
那你是不承认吗
So you refuse to admit it.

301
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,170
承认我是否想要这结果  这毫不相干
Admit it's what I want? That's irrelevant.

302
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,210
是你安排了这次会面  不是我
You're the one who asked for this meeting, not me.

303
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,340
这次会面是想要解决问题
This meeting's about trying to solve a problem,

304
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,370
不是满足个人野心
not fulfill some personal ambition.

305
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,420
但如果两者可兼得  你不会反对
But if both could be achieved, you wouldn't object.

306
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,860
不管总统想要谁
I think this is a sound course of action

307
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,910
接替马修斯  这么做都合情合理
regardless of who the President taps to replace Matthews.

308
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,950
现在我得赌上一切了
I must gamble everything I have right now.

309
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,790
如果我说实话  可能会落人口实
If I'm honest, she may use it against me.

310
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,700
如果不说  她又不会帮我
If I'm not, she won't lift a finger.

311
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,050
我自己也用过这策略
I've used the same tactic myself.

312
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,780
一个人的目的一旦暴露
Once someone is exposed,

313
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,440
他们就得听你发落
they're at your mercy.

314
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,200
她想要我亲口说出来
She wants to hear me say the words.

315
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,150
没错
Yes.

316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,710
我想当副总统
I want to be the Vice President.

317
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,360
没错  我把你儿子弄进大学
And, yes, I helped your son get into college

318
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,670
是希望你能还我一个人情
in the hopes that you would return the favor.

319
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,690
但我不能逼你这么做  琳达
But I can't force you to do so, Linda.

320
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,680
我还觉得我们应该强强联手
But I also think that we would make a formidable team.

321
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,200
即使存在分歧
Look what we've been able to accomplish

322
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,060
我们都能做成这么多大事
even when we've been at odds with each other.

323
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,120
如果我们达成一致  那又会是怎样的局面
Now put your mind to what we could accomplish if we weren't.

324
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,560
感谢你的宝贵时间  琳达
Thank you for taking the time, Linda.

325
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,720
我再打给你  怎么样了
I'll call you back. How'd it go?

326
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,060
她深藏不露啊
She's holding her cards very close to the chest.

327
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,710
-有彼得的消息吗  -没有
- Any word from Peter? - Nothing.

328
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,910
克里斯蒂娜说他不肯离开公寓
Christina said he wouldn't leave the apartment.

329
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,100
但我打给门卫  他说彼得走了
But I called the doorman, and he said that Peter was gone.

330
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,770
-去哪了  -他不知道
- Where? - He doesn't know.

331
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,360
他得正式退选给沃克施加压力
He needs to officially withdraw to put pressure on Walker.

332
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,610
我正在找他
I'm trying to track him down.

333
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,460
你为什么一开始不看好他
Why'd you let him out of your sight in the first place?

334
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,590
我以为他在洗澡
I thought he was showering.

335
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,270
我和你打电话时他跑掉了
He disappeared when I was on the phone with you.

336
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,450
计划是这样的  道格
There was a plan here, Doug.

337
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,550
他搞砸了  然后退选
He explodes, he withdraws,

338
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,360
我们帮他振作起来  再让他悄悄离开
we put him back together, and he quietly goes away.

339
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,210
罗素自昨天早上
Russo has made no public appearances

340
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,320
被人认为醉酒后接受匹兹堡
since allegations that he was inebriated

341
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
WZPZ电台采访至今仍未公开露面
during a radio interview on WZPZ Pittsburgh yesterday morning.

342
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,180
据民主党领导人透露
Sources among the Democratic leadership have suggested

343
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,700
党派正在考虑由谁来取代罗素
that the party is currently considering options to replace Russo.

344
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,610
同时  据昨晚CNN登记选民民调显示
Meanwhile, Republican candidate Jack Swofford's lead

345
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,910
共和党候选人杰克・斯沃夫
has jumped to a 24-point margin,

346
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,920
支持率猛增  已领先24个百分点
according to an overnight CNN poll of registered voters.

347
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,900
斯沃夫竞选团队的
The Swofford campaign

348
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,940
资助金额也急剧攀升
is also reporting a sharp spike in contributions...

349
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,610
过去20小时内筹集了近五十万美金
nearly half a million dollars in the last 20...

350
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,260
罗素尚未露面  竞选堪忧

351
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,330
我今早看见了
I saw that this morning.

352
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,430
是弗兰西斯让彼得竞选的
Francis got Peter to run.

353
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,100
你认识他吗
Do you know him well?

354
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,580
不太熟
We weren't close.

355
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,250
你需要打电话吗
Do you need to make calls?

356
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,950
-我可以去别的房间  -不用
- 'Cause I can head into the other room. - I don't think so.

357
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,960
谢了
Thanks.

358
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,210
你去哪里
Where are you going?

359
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,760
去暗室  我今天应该去的
To the lab. I should've gone in today.

360
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,870
亚当
Adam.

361
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,850
-亚当  -你走  快走
- Adam... - Just go. Go. Leave.

362
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,040
你觉得我们还能维持多久
How long do you think this can possibly go on for?

363
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,330
我们在一起的时间从没超过两天
We have never spent more than 48 hours together.

364
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,930
或许是有原因的
Maybe there's a reason for that.

365
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,890
我心里仍有一部分爱着你
A part of me still loves you.

366
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,890
哪一部分
Which part?

367
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,000
我不能做一个休息站  克莱尔
I can't be just a pit stop, Claire,

368
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,650
-或是避风港  -拜托
- or some sort of escape... - Oh, come on.

369
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,140
-你不止如此  -或是填补
- You're more than that. - ... or a top-up on

370
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,030
-弗兰西斯不能给你的一切  -少来
- whatever Francis can't provide. - Oh, fuck off!

371
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,870
他是我丈夫  亚当
He's my husband, Adam.

372
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,240
我们经历的事远超出你的想象
We've gone through more than you could ever imagine.

373
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
我嫉妒并被你的自由自所吸引
I envy your free spirit, and I'm attracted to it,

374
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,980
并不是所有人都有这福分
but not all of us have that luxury.

375
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,660
这也是你让我失望的地方  克莱尔
Which is what I find so frustrating about you, Claire.

376
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,140
你可以选择的
You... you had a choice.

377
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,200
但你选择放弃自由
You chose not to be free.

378
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,940
不  我选了个能爱他超过一周的男人
No. What I chose was a man I could love for more than a week.

379
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,340
我不该那么说
I shouldn't have said that. I...

380
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,650
至少你说了实话
At least you're being honest.

381
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,870
我无法像你这样活在当下  亚当
I can't live moment to moment like you, Adam.

382
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,680
我和弗兰西斯有过去  有未来
I have a history with Francis, I have a future with him,

383
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,850
那比一时要大
and it's bigger than a moment.

384
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,550
那你应该扼杀
Then you should kill it...

385
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,570
你仍爱着我的那部分
whatever part of you still loves me.

386
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,360
如果你办不到
If you can't,

387
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,010
我会的
I will.

388
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,780
-亚当  -不
- Adam... - No.

389
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,480
-喂  -亲爱的
- Hello? - Hey. Hey, sweetie.

390
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,860
你怎么样  我  你妈在旁边吗
How's it going? I'm... are you with your mom?

391
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,700
她在楼下  要我叫她来接吗
She's downstairs. You want me to go get her?

392
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,770
不  我只想打过来
No. No. I just wanted to call and say,

393
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,110
跟你和你弟弟打个招呼
you know, hey to your... uh, your brother and you.

394
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,280
他在吗
Is he... is he there?

395
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,050
他大概在自己房里
He's in his room, I think.

396
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,880
好吧  你能去叫他吗
Okay. You wanna go get him?

397
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,300
等等
Hold on.

398
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,330
他说不想和你说话
He says he doesn't want to talk to you.

399
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,620
什么
What?

400
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,510
为什么
Why not?

401
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,220
我们看新闻了  爸爸
We've seen the news, dad.

402
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,030
昨天好多媒体都跑来我们学校
There were all sorts of TV cameras at our school yesterday.

403
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,400
妈妈让我们这周待在家里
Mom's making us stay home this week.

404
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,320
我想让你做件事  我想让你
I want you to do something. I want you to go to, uh,

405
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,950
到卧室窗边  往外看
your bedroom window and look out.

406
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,080
看见那辆黑车了吗
You see that black car?

407
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,590
-嗯  -我在里面
- Yeah. - That's me.

408
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,580
你不该在这儿的  爸爸  妈妈会发火的
You shouldn't be here, dad. Mom would be really angry.

409
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,250
我们不跟她说  好吗
Well, we don't need to tell her. Right?

410
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,070
就当作...
It'll just be... it'll just be, uh...

411
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,040
我们之间的小秘密
it'll just be our little secret.

412
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,920
你的声音很奇怪
Your voice sounds weird,

413
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,790
就像在广播里那样
like it did on the radio.

414
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,610
你听了那个
You... you heard that?

415
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,510
我有电脑
I have a computer.

416
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,850
我...有时候爸爸也会犯错
I...sometimes your dad makes mistakes.

418
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,860
-我要挂了  -别
- I better go. - No.

419
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,730
我不想听到你这样的声音
I don't like to hear your voice when it's like this.

420
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,520
让我难过  再见  爸爸  
It makes me sad. Bye, dad.

421
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,880
萨拉  别...
Sarah, please...

422
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,710
克里斯蒂娜

423
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,360
彼得
Peter?

424
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,580
克里斯蒂娜
Christina.

425
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,610
你在哪里
Where are you?

426
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,340
我...
I'm, uh...

427
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,440
我现在...感觉不怎么好
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not doing so well.

428
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,720
你在哪里  彼得
Where are you, Peter?

429
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,980
-在车里  -你在开车吗
- I'm in my car. - Are you driving?

430
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,110
没有
No.

431
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,520
告诉我你在哪里
Tell me where you are.

432
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,050
在我孩子家门外
I'm outside my kids' house.

433
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,600
-你是说玛德琳的家  -对
- You mean Madeleine's? - Yeah.

434
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,260
我要你待在那儿别动
I need you to stay right there.

435
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,310
好吗  彼得
Okay, Peter?

436
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,640
你能待在那儿吗
You'll stay there?

437
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,860
彼得
Peter.

438
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,400
彼得  还在听吗
Peter, are you still there?

439
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,440
喂
Hello?

440
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,220
喂
Hello?

441
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,580
警察局

442
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,660
我要自首
I'd like to turn myself in.

443
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,900
什么事
For what?

444
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,290
几个月前
A few months ago,

445
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,600
我因醉驾被警察拦下
I was pulled over for drunk driving.

446
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,440
他们放我走了  我应该被定罪的
They let me go. I should've been convicted.

447
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,720
如果你当时被释放了  先生
Well, if you were let go, sir,

448
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,400
我们现在不能逮捕你
we can't arrest you for it now.

449
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,090
我醉驾开过来的  为这个逮捕我吧
Well, I drunk drove here. Arrest me for that.

450
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,170
我们可以送你去戒酒间...
We can put you in a detox tank...

451
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,110
我想被正式拘捕
I wanna be formally arrested.

452
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,480
我是彼得・罗素议员
My name is Congressman Peter Russo.

453
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,210
一月曾在密歇根大道被捕
I was arrested in January on Michigan Avenue.

454
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,610
请稍坐一下  议员先生
Please have a seat, Congressman.

455
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,970
我去打几个电话
I gotta make a few phone calls.

456
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,560
你找到他了吗
Have you found him?

457
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,270
我在他前妻家外面
I'm in front of his ex-wife's house.

458
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,770
克里斯蒂娜说他在这儿打了电话
Christina said he called from there.

459
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,390
-他不在那儿  -是的
- He's not there? - No.

460
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,500
但手机在  扔在了路边
But his phone is. I found it by the curb.

461
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,980
那么我们就联系不上他了
So we have no way to contact him?

462
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,780
除非他主动联系我们
Not unless he reaches out to us.

463
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,650
这不太妙
This isn't good.

464
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,630
要我去报案吗
Want me to alert the authorities?

465
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,010
我们再给他点时间
Let's give him a little longer.

466
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,550
-你们交往了多久  -大概半年
- How long did it last? - About six months.

467
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,510
-他比我大  -大很多吗
- He was older. - A lot?

468
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,250
对
Yeah.

469
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,430
是个记者  还是在国会工作
Was he a journalist, or did he work on The Hill?

470
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,690
这我还是不说了
I'd rather not say.

471
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
好吧
All right.

472
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,420
我之前有段时间很尊敬他
He was someone I looked up to... for a while.

473
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,510
为什么结束
Why did it end?

474
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,760
他有妻子
He has a wife.

475
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,700
我们都知道最终会结束的
We both knew it was gonna end eventually.

476
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,430
我是说  真是...
I mean, it was really...

477
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,810
糟糕透顶
it was fucked up.

478
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,290
我们在一起的第一晚
The first night we spent together,

479
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,670
他说  他会伤害我  然后遗弃我
he told me he was gonna hurt me and then discard me.

480
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,970
结束的时候  我对他说  他都没做到
And when it ended, I told him that he'd done neither.

481
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,150
但...
But...

482
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,430
我确实很受伤
it does hurt.

483
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,820
我不会伤害你
I won't hurt you.

484
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,800
这你不能保证
Yeah, you can't promise me that.

485
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,730
我能
Yes, I can.

486
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,540
-有人见过他吗  -没有
- Has anyone else seen him? - No.

487
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,370
他独自一人待在审讯室里
He's in an interrogation room by himself.

488
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,640
我就不该搅这趟浑水
I never should've got mixed up with this fucking mess.

489
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,970
现在后悔太迟了  巴尼
We're way behind regret time, Barney.

490
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,970
别让人看见他
Just have your guys keep him out of sight.

491
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,180
给我找个后门
I'll need a back exit.

492
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,070
-我来吧  谢谢  -好
- I got him. Thanks. - Yeah.

493
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,960
走吧
Come on.

494
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,500
彼得
Hey, Peter.

495
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:34,740
你的车在哪里
Where's your car?

496
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,660
街那头
It's down the street.

497
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,650
我送你回家吧
I'll drive you home.

498
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,230
你去我家  让密查姆给你开门
You go back to mine, have Meechum let you in.

499
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,620
-这边吗  -嗯
- This way? - Yeah.

500
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,070
你在想什么啊  彼得
What were you thinking, Peter?

501
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,090
我得为我的行为负责
I need to take responsibility for my actions.

502
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,130
让自己蹲监狱吗
By getting yourself thrown in jail?

503
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,780
真正地负责
Real responsibility.

504
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,160
就像互戒会聚会时说的那样
Like... like they talk about in the meetings,

505
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,040
而不是为竞选而撒的谎
not the lies we told for the campaign.

506
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,340
你刚才的行为太鲁莽了
What you just did was extremely reckless.

507
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,300
我不在乎
I don't care.

508
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,530
我明天要做一份声明  弗兰克
I'm making a statement tomorrow, Frank.

509
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,740
关于退出竞选吗
About pulling out of the race?

510
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,030
那不够  我...
That's not enough. I...

511
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,190
我不能再逃避了
I need to stop hiding.

512
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,760
那我们一起研究措辞
Well, let's work together on the language.

513
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,490
我得独立完成  必须是我自己的话
I have to do it on my own. It's gotta be my own words.

514
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,130
听着  彼得  这不单是你的事了  好吗
Look, Peter, this isn't just about you anymore, all right?

515
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,060
-让我帮你  -我不要你帮忙
- Let me help you. - I don't want your help.

516
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,090
我被捕的时候也没求过你帮忙
I didn't never ask your help when you... I got arrested.

517
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,520
你的帮助对我有什么好处
When did your help ever help me?

518
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,010
你怎么生活我不管
You can live your life the way you want to.

519
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,680
但也别来管我怎么过
I'm done being told how to live mine.

520
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,580
肯定有办法  既能担起责任
Well, there has to be a way to take responsibility without

521
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,420
又不用毁了一切
shattering everything.

522
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,880
你至少愿意跟我探讨下这个吗
Are you at least willing to have that discussion?

523
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
-要我上楼吗  -不用了
- Do you want me to come upstairs? - No.

524
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,540
我知道你很痛苦  彼得
I know you're in a lot of pain, Peter.

525
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,360
但今晚我不想你觉得痛苦
But I don't want you to feel any pain tonight.

526
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,930
给  从明天开始改头换面吧
Here. You can start fresh tomorrow.

527
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,350
喝吧  我不会说什么  我也来点
Go ahead. I won't judge you. Hell, I'll even join you.

528
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,010
放松
Just relax.

529
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,780
你到家了
You're home now.

530
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,950
不管你明天要面对什么
Whatever it is you have to face tomorrow,

531
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,610
现在都不用去想
you don't have to face it now.

532
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,420
这儿只有你和我
Right now it's just you and me.

533
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,190
其他的都无关紧要
The rest of the world doesn't matter.

534
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,910
你的孩子  克里斯蒂娜
Your children, Christina...

535
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,470
他们会原谅你的
they will forgive you,

536
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,310
因为他们爱你  彼得
because you're loved, Peter.

537
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,770
辜负
Failed.

538
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,540
我辜负了自己
I failed myself.

539
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,410
我的家庭
I failed my family.

540
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,530
还有竞选
I failed the campaign.

541
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,020
别这么说  彼得
No, you haven't, Peter.

542
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,180
我能来点吗
May I?

543
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,140
我跟克莱尔刚结婚时
You know, when Claire and I were first married,

544
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,910
也谈过要孩子的事
we talked about having children.

545
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,620
我直接说我不想要孩子
I told her flat out I didn't want any.

546
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,580
这很自私  却很诚实
It was selfish but honest.

547
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,080
我的童年并不幸福
I didn't have a particularly happy childhood.

548
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,840
我猜你也一样
I suspect you didn't either.

549
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,260
是的
No.

550
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,060
谁都避不开痛苦
You see, no person avoids pain.

551
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,450
既然是如此  我觉得就不该要孩子
And I just didn't think it was right to bring a child in knowing that.

552
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,210
但当我回想过去
But now when I think back, I...

553
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,750
才意识到这很懦弱
I realize that was cowardly.

554
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,980
当我看到你
I see you,

555
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,080
我就想  这人很勇敢  
and I think, well, there's a brave man,

556
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,220
比我勇敢得多
far braver than me.

557
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,420
我好累
I'm so tired.

558
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,890
当我想到
When I... when I think about... when I...

559
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,910
我好累
I'm so tired.

560
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,160
闭上眼睛吧
You should close your eyes.

561
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,620
忘掉一切
Let it all go.

562
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,570
我们有的是时间
We have all the time in the world.

563
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,630
彼得
Peter?

564
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,090
彼得
Peter.

565
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,840
我走回来的
I walked back.

566
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,880
不管接下来几小时发生了什么
Whatever happens in the next few hours,

567
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,430
无论你听到什么
whatever you hear,

568
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,340
我们都永远不提
we will never speak of it.

569
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,230
先生
Sir...

570
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,450
半小时前琳达打来电话
I heard from Linda about a half an hour ago.

571
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,870
总统想见你
The President wants to meet with you.

572
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,170
八点半
8:30.

573
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,610
什么事
About what?

574
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,680
不清楚
I don't know.

575
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,120
弗兰克
Frank.

576
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,960
你最初提出这主意时  我并不赞同
Now, when you brought up this idea, I wasn't sold.

577
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,610
我觉得这主意太极端  欠考虑
It struck me as both desperate and careless.

578
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,600
但琳达列出了所有好处
But then Linda laid out all the pros,

579
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,960
显然是好处多于坏处
and they clearly outweigh the cons.

580
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,150
我把道理解释给吉姆听
I explained our reasoning to Jim

581
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,370
希望他不会以为我疯了
and hoped he wouldn't think I was off my rocker.

582
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,800
最初很难接受
I did at first,

583
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,520
但总统说了些很有力的理由
but the President made some very good arguments.

584
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,020
这一招很大胆  弗兰克  
It's a bold move, Frank.

585
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,270
我很佩服
I'm very impressed.

586
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,780
感谢你愿意考虑  先生
Well, thank you, sir, for being open to the idea.

587
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,720
谢谢您敢于承担风险  总统先生
And thank you, Mr. President, for taking the risk.

588
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,380
这要一步步来
We'll need to work this out step by step.

589
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,140
执行过程不能有一丝差错
The execution has to be perfect.

590
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,990
罗素那边怎么样了  有他的消息吗
Where are things with Russo? Any word from him yet?

591
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,270
我们还在找他
We're still trying to locate him.

592
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,330
-需要担心他吗  -他失踪两天了
- Well, is there any cause for worry? - It's been two days.

593
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,020
不得不承认  我有点担心
I am a bit worried, I have to admit.

594
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,670
他现在肯定很难熬
I mean, this must be an extremely difficult moment for him.

595
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,380
希望他会尽快联系我们
We're hoping he'll reach out shortly.

596
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,570
派我们的人调查  我想知道他在哪
Let's get our people on it. I wanna know where he is.

597
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,410
一旦他退出竞选  我们得迅速行动
Now, once he withdraws, we have to move quickly.

598
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,940
我们会像你说的  发布联合声明
We'll make a joint statement, as you proposed.

I like Nash, but I'll want to bring in some of my own people.

美国大选是在11月第一个星期二  这是美国初建国时就定下来的
选在11月  是因为大量选民是在远郊的农民
他们入秋收了庄稼后才有时间投票
同时因为美国有着浓厚的基督教传统
所以周末大家都要去教堂  然后周一启程去投票
地广人稀  农民们骑驴赶马  往往要走上一天才能到投票站
于是投票日被定在星期二
