1
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,070
这是我们谈下绩效标准的筹码
It's there for leverage so that we can lock down performance standards.

2
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,460
你不能随便拿集体谈判当筹码
You don't toss around their right to collective bargaining like a poker chip.

3
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,360
我们不这么做  他们就不让步
If we don't, they won't budge.

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,050
马蒂・斯比奈拉看过了吗
Has Marty Spinella seen this?

5
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,460
给他看的跟这不一样
Not the version I showed him.

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,620
这么说你对他撒谎了
So you lied to his face.

7
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,980
不  我改变了我承诺的内容
No. I revised the parameters of my promise.

8
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,020
也就是撒谎
Which is lying.

9
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,360
是政治
Which is politics...

10
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,550
是你精通之道  鲍勃
the sort you're well versed in, Bob.

11
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,950
我来和你谈谈政治
Here's some politics for you.

12
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,220
我允许这个法案辩论投票
I allow this to go to the floor,

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,050
下次选举我会死无葬身之地
I get murdered next election.

14
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,830
这是总统的意思
This is coming from the President.

15
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,080
据我所知
Last time I checked,

16
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,440
我还是民主党人  弗兰克
I was still a Democrat, Frank,

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,670
你也是
and you were too.

18
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,070
你想告诉我总统不是了吗
Are you telling me the President isn't?

19
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,680
因为他现在表现得像个十足的共和党人
Because he's acting a hell of a lot like a Republican.

20
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,300
鲍勃不是我们这边的吗
I thought Bob was on our team.

21
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,740
让他和总统坐下来谈十分钟
Just sit him down with the President ten minutes.

22
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,660
集体谈判的条款不能改
We won't touch collective bargaining.

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,400
你想听我对此的意见吗
Are you interested in my advice on this,

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
还是只想让我传个话
or do you just want me to deliver the message?

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,660
我永远想听你的意见  弗兰克
I'm always interested in your advice, Frank.

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,300
博奇是对的  你这样会激怒很多人
Birch is right. You're going to burn a lot of bridges.

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,780
总统至少应该坐下和他谈谈
The President should at least sit down with him

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,070
让他说说他的看法
and let him make his case.

29
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,480
你跟鲍勃说
You tell Bob

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,830
只要他肯让法案进入辩论投票
I'm happy to schedule a meeting with the President

31
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,350
我就给他安排和总统的见面
once he's set a date to put this bill on the floor.

32
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,760
总统可以一边玩去了
The President can fuck himself.

33
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,440
这是党章  是他竞选的核心理念
This is the platform. It's what he ran on.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,030
我才不在乎他的理念是什么
I don't give a shit what he ran on.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,270
他休想压倒议会
He can't steamroll the house.

36
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,510
不要忘记
And don't forget,

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,530
你是为我工作  弗兰克  不是为他
you work for me, Frank, not him.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,050
他想让法案辩论投票
If he wants something on the floor,

39
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,030
就必须直接来找我说
he's gonna have to talk to me directly.

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,680
我知道你很为你的家伙骄傲  鲍勃
I know you take a lot of pride in your manhood, Bob,

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,430
的确令人刮目相看
and it's impressive,

42
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,720
但不管你多大
but as big as it is,

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,110
琳达还是会让你吃闭门羹
Linda can still shut the door on it.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,830
告诉瓦斯奎兹法案没戏
Tell Vasquez the bill is dead.

45
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,920
他不是头一次跟我来这套了
That's not the first time he's pulled that stunt on me.

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,790
也许我不该说什么
Probably should have held my tongue,

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,720
但我就是忍不住想看他萎下去的样子
but I just couldn't resist the chance to see him shrivel.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,160
早上好
Good morning.

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,250
弗兰克
Frank.

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,660
总统先生
Mr. President.

51
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,820
琳达
Linda.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,890
我们把法案中的反集体谈判条款去掉
Let's strike the anti-collective bargaining provision from the bill.

53
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,210
琳达和我谈过了  我认为她的观点很正确
Linda and I have talked it over, and I think she's right on this.

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,970
告诉鲍勃他可以明天下午过来
Tell Bob he can come by tomorrow afternoon.

55
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,350
先生  恕我冒犯
Sir, respectfully,

56
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,880
我认为你不该满足他的愿望
I do not think you should give him the satisfaction.

57
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,220
那是为什么
Well, give me a reason.

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,720
会让我们显得软弱
Makes us appear weak.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,960
这是一个建立您权威的好机会
There's an opportunity for you to establish your supremacy.

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,970
我们应该抓住这个机会
We should seize it.

61
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,300
但博奇如果不合作
But without Birch's cooperation,

62
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,850
法案还没开始辩论投票我们就会举步维艰
we're fighting an uphill battle before we even get the bill to the floor.

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,860
弗兰克  这个我们谈过了
Frank, we discussed this.

64
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,840
先生  如果你现在放弃
Sir, if you give in now,

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,480
博奇在接下来的四年里
Birch will walk all over you

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,310
就会对你为所欲为
for the next four years.

67
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,860
我能让法案不做删减地进入辩论
I can get this bill on the house floor as is.

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,240
我保证
I promise you.

69
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,650
好吧  弗兰克  给我露一手吧
All right, Frank. Show me what you can do.

70
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,330
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

71
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,500
她刚刚想窃取我的主意
That was her trying to take credit for my idea.

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,070
还是她不肯接受的建议  不可忍受
Advice she wouldn't take from me... unacceptable.

73
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,950
我决不允许她卖我的东西
I will not allow her to sell my goods

74
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,700
还不给我好处
when she cuts me out of the profits.

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,460
我明确说过不许接受采访
I specifically told her no interviews.

76
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,810
她违抗我的命令
She disobeyed me...

77
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,800
不止一次
not just once.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,830
上个月就至少有8次
At least eight times in the past month.

79
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,860
她不能走  汤姆
She stays, Tom.

80
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,230
她不尊重我的权威  玛格丽特
She has no respect for my authority, Margaret.

81
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,570
我说了  她不能走
I said she stays.

82
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,820
我们有规则
There are rules.

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,090
做事有准则
There's a way of doing things.

84
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,610
如果我的记者不听...
If I have a reporter who won't listen to...

85
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,410
两个大一女生一起搬进她们的宿舍
two freshmen girls are moving into their dorm room together.

86
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,550
一个来自佐治亚州
One of them's from Georgia,

87
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,100
另一个来自康涅狄格州
one of them's from Connecticut.

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,280
康涅狄格的女孩在帮她妈妈挂窗帘
The girl from Connecticut's helping her mother put up curtains.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,180
佐治亚的姑娘对她们说
The girl from Georgia turns to them and says,

90
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,440
你们好啊  你们打哪来
"Hi. Where y'all from?"

91
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,790
康涅狄格州姑娘说
The girl from Connecticut says,

92
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,060
我们来自一个
"We're from a place where we know

93
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,180
句子不以介词结尾的地方
not to end a sentence with a preposition."

94
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,540
佐治亚的姑娘说  不好意思
The girl from Georgia says, "Oh, beg my pardon.

95
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,400
你们打哪来
Where y'all from...

96
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,460
婊子
cunt?"

97
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,010
以前听过吗
You heard that one before?

98
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,140
听过其他版本  没那么粗鲁
A version of it. With softer language.

99
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,290
汤姆  我们不需要循规蹈矩的人
Tom, we don't need people who follow the rules.

100
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,270
我们需要有个性的人
We need people with personality.

101
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,160
我们需要佐伊这张面孔  她的能量
We want Zoe's face, her energy.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,360
要尽可能让她多上电视
We want to get her on TV as much as possible.

103
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
这能让我们脱颖而出
It helps us cut through the noise.

104
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,080
明白吗
See what I'm saying?

105
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,310
明白了  玛格丽特
I hear you, Margaret.

106
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,120
谢谢  汤姆
Thank you, Tom.

谢谢你了

108
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,330
请进
Come in.

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,950
我以为
Oh. I, uh, thought...

110
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,180
我本想跟伊芙琳打个招呼
I wanted to say hi to Evelyn.

111
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,530
伊芙琳
Evelyn?

112
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,380
这原来是她的办公室
This was her office.

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,690
我想她已经不在这儿工作了
I don't think she works here anymore.

114
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,390

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,030
我几周前刚加入的

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,770
世界之井的吉莉安吗

117
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,950
是啊

你是克莱尔的同事吗

121
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,610
算是吧
In a way.

122

你好  雷米
Hello, Remy.

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,210

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,850
-看来你见过吉莉安了  -是啊  刚刚认识
- I see you've met Gillian.   - Yes, just now.

125
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,920
她在为我们做了不起的工作
She's doing fantastic work for us,

126
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,090
如你所见
as you can see.

127
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,010
红色是已完工的水井
Red is completed wells,

128
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,310
绿色是可能地点
green, uh, potential sites,

129
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,770
黄色是获得许可的
yellow approved sites,

130
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,380
蓝色是过滤中心
and blue are the filtration centers.

131
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,000
很好  你喜欢这里吗
Nice. So you liking it here?

喜欢啊  我和工作人员都喜欢

133
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,720
克莱尔为我们创造了许多机会
Claire's opened a lot of doors for us.

134
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,930
克莱尔就是这样
Sounds like Claire.

135
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,590
去我办公室吧
Shall we head to my office?

136
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,150
吉莉安  很高兴认识你
Gillian, nice to meet you.

137
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,420
我也是
Nice to meet you.

138
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,370
怎么回事
What happened?

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
事情变复杂了
Things got complicated.

140
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,530
桑科当时面临困境
San Corp was in a difficult situation.

141
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,340
我以为遇到困难
I would have thought you'd step up

142
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,840
你会出面解决
when things were difficult,

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
而不是拿捐款作交换条件
not hold the donation hostage.

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,670
但现在又没那么复杂了
Well, things are less complicated now.

145
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,740
他们又愿意捐款了
The donation is back on the table.

146
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,290
我被迫炒了半数员工
I had to fire half my staff.

147
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,950
你可以再把他们雇回来了
Now you can hire them back.

148
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,720
桑科愿将最初承诺金额翻倍
San Corp is prepared to double its initial commitment...

149
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,570
本季度一次性支付150万
1.5 million, lump sum, this quarter.

150
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,830
-为什么  -和之前一样  公关
- Why? - Public relations. Same as before.

151
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,000
他们想从弗兰西斯那里得到什么
And what do they want from Francis?

152
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,930
我们跟弗兰克都扯平了
Things are square with Frank.

153
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,630
我们只谈净水计划的事
We're only talking about the C.W.I.

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,760
但为什么要翻倍
But why double it?

155
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,110
因为我说服了他们
Because I said they should.

156
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,940
他们给的越多  你们能做的也越多
The more they give, the more you can do.

157
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,020
你们做的越多  他们就越有面子
The more you can do, the better they look.

158
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,900
他们雇格兰顿-希尔
And that's why they hired Glendon Hill...

159
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,580
就是为了撑门面
to make them look good.

160
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,900
他们还雇你在国会拉拢人
And they also hired you to get traction in congress.

161
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,290
这次不同
Not in this case.

162
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,530
我们想建立长期合作关系  克莱尔
We want a long-term partnership, Claire.

163
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,600
这是对未来的投资
This is an investment in the future.

164
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,910
我们没有其他要求
We're not attaching strings.

165
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,530
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

166
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,620
他们希望能尽快落实
They'd really love to move quickly on this.

167
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,340
我说了我会考虑的
I said I'll think about it.

168
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,280
玛德琳  你得把这个发过来
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.

169
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
我需要书面文件
I need it in writing.

170
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,490
而且还有一个多小时呢
And with more than an hour's notice.

171
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,640
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know that,

172
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,040
但你得理解  我们有计划的
but you have to understand we... we have a plan.

173
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,310
我们做事有自己的方法
We have a way that we do this,

174
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,840
如果你...
and when you...

175
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,410
好吧
Okay.

176
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,430
好
Fine.

177
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,580
嗯  再见
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

178
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,090
玛德琳临时起意
Madeleine has decided to have

179
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,350
要跟她在交友网上认识的男友
a spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando with her

180
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,630
去奥兰多旅行
latest eHarmony catch.

181
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,880
不事先通知  都不说一声
No heads-up, no warning.

182
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,640
孩子们呢
The kids?

183
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,420
他们两点半放学
They get out of school at 2:30.

184
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,630
我可以去和船厂的人会面
I can do the shipbuilders meeting.

185
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,040
真的
You sure?

186
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,180
是的  只是个公共事务小组而已
Yeah, it's just a public affairs team.

187
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,500
回头我向你报告  你明天再打给他们
I'll brief you, and then you can call them tomorrow.

188
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,820
你去接孩子吧
Go get your kids.

189
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,200
雷米今天早上去过我办公室
Remy came by this morning. To the office.

190
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,600
他想干什么
What does he want?

191
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,350
捐款的事又有门了
The donation's back on the table.

192
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,410
数额翻了一番  有150万
They've doubled it to 1.5 million.

193
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,630
-你回绝了吧  -没有
- You said no, right? - I didn't.

194
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,960
他并不图你任何回报  弗兰西斯
He doesn't want anything from you, Francis.

195
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,920
得了吧  克莱尔  你这还不懂吗
Come on, Claire. You know better than that.

196
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,740
我特意问过的
I specifically asked.

197
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,310
也许他现在不求回报
Maybe not right now,

198
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,740
他是我一手提拔的
but look, I invented this guy, all right?

199
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,990
迈出这一步就刹不住了
It's a slippery slope. You...

200
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,200
想想有了这笔钱我能做多少事
Think of what I can do with this money.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,690
我能把辞退的职员全部请回来
I can hire back the people I let go.

202
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,940
还能加快吉莉安那些项目的
I can help accelerate the funding for the projects

203
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,180
融资进度
that Gillian has brought in.

204
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,690
资金的事我们可以另想办法
Let's find another way to raise the money.

205
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,480
但这笔钱唾手可得
But it's right there at my feet.

206
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,920
克莱尔  我现在已经百事缠身了
Claire, I have too much on my plate right now.

207
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,220
不能再被桑科公司纠缠上
I can't have San corp breathing down my neck again.

208
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,520
我不能让雷米
I can't have Remy...

209
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,290
那是雷米啊
Look, it is Remy.

210
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,650
他太了解我了  这很危险
He knows me too well. It's dangerous.

211
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,930
要顾全大局
Look at the bigger picture here.

212
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,170
我恳求你
I'm asking.

213
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,900
你这不是恳求
No. You're not.

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,900
克莱尔
Claire.

215
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,810
我会用回复他的话答复你
I'll tell you what I told him.

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,830
你说
Which was?

217
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,330
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

218
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,820
我知道最近我们有些紧张
I know there's been some tension,

219
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,180
而且我应该负主要责任
and I'm probably more to blame than you are.

220
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,290
但过去的事就让它过去吧
But I'd like to put that behind us.

221
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,300
佐伊
Zoe,

222
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,280
你将成为我们新一任驻白宫记者
you're going to be our new White House correspondent.

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,520
那简宁呢
What about Janine?

224
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,800
升任中西部总编辑
I promoted her to Midwest Bureau chief.

225
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,070
她同意了吗
She's okay with that?

226
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,370
她舍得放弃白宫的工作
She wants to give up the White House?

227
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,060
这是我的决定
It's the decision I've made.

228
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,290
可简宁毕竟经验丰富
It's just that Janine has so much experience.

229
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,980
我还以为你会很兴奋呢
I thought you'd be more excited about this.

230
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,600
抱歉  我还以为你叫我进来是要
I'm sorry. I... I just thought you brought me in here to...

231
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,450
我不知道
I don't know.

232
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,890
解雇你
To fire you.

233
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,300
也许吧
Maybe.

234
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,810
都过去了
Water under the bridge.

235
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,800
我们要重新开始
We're starting over.

236
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,020
那么  你准备好了吗
So are you ready to take this on?

237
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,280
我能考虑一下吗
Can I think about it?

238
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,020
有一份白宫的工作摆在面前
People usually don't have to think about it

239
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,250
人们一般不用考虑的  佐伊
when they're offered the White House, Zoe.

240
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,600
只要一两天就好
Just a day or two.

241
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,420
简宁将乘周五的航班飞往芝加哥
Janine is booked for a flight to Chicago on Friday.

242
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,600
我会在那之前回复你
I'll let you know before then.

243
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,220
我只是要
I just need to...

244
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,490
谢谢你  汤姆
Thank you. Thank you, Tom.

245
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,420
大卫・拉斯姆森是多数党领袖
David Rasmussen is the majority leader,

246
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,870
也就是说他的职位在我之上
which means he's one step above me

247
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,890
在博奇之下
and one below Birch,

248
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,200
就像夹在一匹饿极的狼
which is akin to being between a very hungry wolf

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,860
和一只好斗的羊之间
and a very quarrelsome sheep.

250
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,710
羊群或是狼群  看看他会选择哪一边
Let's see if he stays with the herd or joins the pack.

251
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,710
大卫  不介意我坐这儿吧
David. You mind if I join you?

252
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,250
请坐  就吃沙拉啊
Please. A salad, huh?

253
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,330
是啊  我想好好照顾自己
Yes. I'm trying to take better care of myself.

254
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,540
不错嘛  节食吗
Good man. Diet?

255
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,940
节食  锻炼  各种方法
Diet, exercise, everything.

256
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,130
你也该照顾好自己
You ought to take better care of yourself too.

257
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,430
他们这儿的披萨实在太美味了
Well, they should stop serving such good pizza.

258
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,590
我不是指饮食
Oh, I'm not talking about the food.

259
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,520
我是指博奇
I'm talking about Birch.

260
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,110
你要想当上议长
You are never going to be speaker

261
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,770
就必须得有所行动
unless you do something about it.

262
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,750
我对自己的位置很满意
I'm very satisfied where I am.

263
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,910
-拜托  -就目前来说  确实满意
- Oh, come on. - For the time being, yeah.

264
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,010
一时就是永远
Time being never.

265
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,420
你想成为议长
The only way you become Speaker

266
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,640
只有可能是博奇落选或退休
is if Birch loses his district or retires,

267
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,610
在你我老到要装假牙之前
neither of which is going to happen

268
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,180
这两种情况都不会发生
before you and I have dentures.

269
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,230
我不喜欢你这番话的势头  弗兰克
I'm not happy where this conversation is going, Frank.

270
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,260
你想做议长  我知道你想
If you want it, and I know you do,

271
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,890
我有个办法
there's a way.

272
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,770
好了  我不能...
Okay. Right. I can't...

273
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,420
票数过半就可以  也就是218票
all you need is a simple majority... 218 votes.

274
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,810
我们在共和党能得到205票
We're going to get at least 205 out of the G.O.P.,

275
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,530
这样  再有民主党13票就行
and after that, all you need is 13 Democrats.

276
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,960
你我手里就有两票
You and I make two.

277
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,910
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

278
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,730
稍稍考虑一下吧
Just consider it for a moment.

279
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,280
你想和共和党串通
You want to collude with the Republicans?

280
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,010
我不想
I don't want to,

281
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,550
但如果能让你当上议长  我会的
but I would if you become Speaker in the process.

282
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,790
这种事没有先例
Never been done before.

283
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,750
凡事都有第一次
There's a first time for everything.

284
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,970
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

285
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,400
共和党会很乐意杀杀鲍勃的威风
The Republicans would love a chance to knock Bob down a peg or two.

286
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,790
而你想帮他们
And you want to help them.

287
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,570
我想帮我们
I want to help us.

288
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,350
鲍勃不会和白宫合作
Bob will not play ball with the White House.

289
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,760
你是个通情达理的人  大卫  他不是
Now, you're a reasonable man, David, and he's not.

290
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,910
你知道我是什么人吗
You know what I am?

291
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,270
我是个谨慎的人
I'm a discreet man.

292
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,410
所以算你走运
You're lucky for that.

293
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,290
我不会跟鲍勃说今天的事
I'm not going to mention this to Bob,

294
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,210
你要是再提
but if you ever bring it up again,

295
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,870
我就没办法了
I won't have a choice.

296
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,870
看来他选择了羊群
Looks like he opted for the herd.

297
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,320
克莱尔
Claire.

298
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,780
我想为南苏丹项目的
I'd like to put an order for the water filters

299
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,540
滤水器和钻井机械下订单
and the well-digging equipment for the South Sudan project.

300
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,900
我们能讨论一下预算问题吗
Can we talk about the budget?

301
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,880
-需要多少  -20万
- How much? - 200,000.

302
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,270
一个项目就要这么多
For one project?

303
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,350
我知道很多
I know it's a lot,

304
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,750
但这是我们在非洲的旗舰项目
but it'll be our flagship project in Africa,

305
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,090
我们也是那里首家
and we would be the first organization there

306
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,730
有如此规模的机构
to work on this scale.

307
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,910
我想先核对一下详情
I'd like to go over the specifics first.

308
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,090
我已经做好了预算表
I have the budget right here.

309
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,870
我先查一下留言  就去找你
Let me just grab my messages, and then I'll come in to you.

310
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,590
好  我在办公室等你
Okay. I'll be in my office.

311
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,720
我不在时有电话打来吗
Any calls while I was out?

312
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,580
都放你桌上了  这个是快递送来的
They're on the desk, and this came by messenger.

313
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,450
克莱尔  你不需要桑科  你有我呢  弗兰克

314
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,350
亚当  我是克莱尔
Adam. It's Claire.

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,840
对  我知道  是这样
Yes. I know. It has.

316
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,250
没事  只是想你了
No reason. I was just thinking about you.

317
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,890
你说得对  是谎话
You're right. It is a lie.

318
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,450
我确实有事
I do have a reason.

319
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,040
我需要你
I need to use you.

320
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,190
白宫就是新闻死掉的地方
The White House is where news goes to die.

321
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,310
净是些陈词滥调
Everything's canned.

322
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,320
那些精心编排的讲话...
These perfectly prepared statements...

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,580
那是份威风的工作  佐伊
it's a prestigious job, Zoe.

324
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,840
我九年级的时候是这样的
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.

325
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,440
现在就是块墓地
Now it's a graveyard.

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,480
现在唯一还算有意思的事
The only halfway interesting thing they do

327
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,540
就是每年一度的晚宴
is throw a big dinner party once a year

328
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,180
他们不是自我吹捧
where they pat themselves on the back

329
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,050
就是跟明星勾肩搭背
and rub shoulders with movie stars.

330
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,130
谁要看那个
Who needs that?

331
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,290
从你到这里开始
Every day since you started here,

332
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,160
每天都在求我给你升职  而现在...
you've begged me to move you up, and now...

333
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,550
我的人生理想
My goal in life is not

334
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,800
不是在《先驱报》一步步爬到
to climb up the Herald's ladder one rung at a time

335
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,670
我能有自己的文具
until I've got my own stationery.

336
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,210
我们有些人很珍惜在这样一家报社的发展
Some of us value a career at a paper like this.

337
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,870
抱歉  我不是那个意思...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to come off...

338
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,340
但就是这个感觉  而且你已经跳级了
Well, it did, and you skipped a few rungs, by the way.

339
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,660
想怎么做随便你  佐伊
Do what you want to do, Zoe,

340
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,100
但你要是希望我能给你鼓劲
but if you want me to be your cheerleader and say,

341
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,330
说"推掉它"  我做不到
"Yeah, turn it down," I won't.

342
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,170
我刚来这里时  会为那份工作拼命
I would have killed for that job when I first started here.

343
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,080
113届国会  美国众议院

344
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,650
把菲柯特放在"倾向赞成"里
Put Fichtner in the "Leaning yes" Column.

345
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,870
你不觉得他是中立的吗
Don't you think he's a neutral?

346
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,940
他讨厌博奇
He hates Birch.

347
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,870
是  但他能在财政委员会任职还靠博奇
Yeah, but he owes Birch for the ways and means appointment.

348
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,710
把他放在"中立"里  还有谁
Put him in "Neutral." Who else?

349
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,570
众议院投票计数

350
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,690
雷米兹是中立的吗
Ramirez is a neutral?

351
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,070
这个表格太不可靠了
Oh, this list is so shaky.

352
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,700
他们要是有谁跟鲍勃通了气...
Any one of them leaks it to Bob...

353
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,670
不  我们只需要一个人
No, what we need is one name,

354
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,240
一个能说动12个人的人
one person who can deliver 12.

355
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,280
黑人党团
The black caucus.

356
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,390
乌麦克
Womack.

357
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,990
我们给他什么好处
What can we offer him?

358
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,980
他需要什么
What does he need?

359
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,490
我去调他的档案
Let me pull up his file.

360
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,070
赞成

361
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,000
有了
Here we go.

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,590
他选区的麦喀顿空军基地雇了三千人
McCudden air force base employs 3,000 people in his district.

363
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,490
基地今年可能被国防部关掉
It's on the D.O.D.'s chopping block this year.

364
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,790
军事基地整合委员会里有熟人吗 
Who do we know on the BRAC commission?

365
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,240
这很危险
That's dangerous.

366
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
摆布国防部或军事基地整合委员会
The trail leads back to us trying to influence

367
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,620
会被人查到的
the D.O.D. or the BRAC.

368
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,280
不  不  不  
No, no, no.

369
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,500
我们只要关掉另一个基地
What we do is we close another base.

370
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,360
给国防部留出足够的预算
We leave enough money in the D.O.D.'s budget

371
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,260
让乌麦克的基地逃过一劫
to keep Womack's base off the list.

372
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,730
我们需要的是
What we need...

373
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,010
一个听命于我们的人
Is someone we own.

374
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,140
彼得・罗素

375
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,370
爸爸  我饿了
Dad, I'm hungry.

376
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,780
来了  宝贝
Coming, buddy.

377
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,920
来啦
Here we go.

378

这份有芝士
With cheese.

379
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,650
这份没有芝士
Without cheese.

380
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,750
爸爸
Um, dad?

381
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,740
怎么了
Yeah.

382
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,000
看着真恶心
That looks pretty disgusting.

383
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,790
看起来的确挺恶心
Yeah, it looks disgusting.

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,490
外表不重要  味道才是关键
It's not how it looks, it's how it tastes.

385
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,880
再来把叉子就好了
And a fork would be nice.

386
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
该死  好的  稍等
Shit. Okay. Hold on.

387
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,660
你好
Hello.

388
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,090
晚上好  罗素先生
Good evening, Mr. Russo.

389
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,870
有位安德伍德先生来访
There's a Mr. Underwood here to see you.

390
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,410
好的  请他上来
Uh... Okay. Send him up.

391
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,590
你们好啊
Hi, there.

392
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,310
这是凯文  这是萨拉

-你是爸爸的同事吗  -是的

395
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,340
安德伍德议员是爸爸的老板
Congressman Underwood is daddy's boss.

396
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,100
我还以为你没有老板
I thought you didn't have a boss.

397
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,560
人人都有老板  甜心
Everybody has a boss, sweetheart,

398
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,410
议员也不例外
even congressmen.

399
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,190
把晚餐拿去卧室里吃吧
Why don't you take your dinner and go into the bedroom?

400
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,490
-可我想看电视  -现在就去
- But I wanted to watch TV. - Go now.

401
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,270
孩子们很可爱
Cute kids.

402
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,620
是啊  我爱他们
Yeah, I like them.

403
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,950
来杯喝的怎么样
Can I get you a drink?

404
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,660
不用  我很快就走
No, I won't be here long.

405
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,670
好的  请坐
Yeah. Have a seat.

406
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,330
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

407
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,560
那是索尼次时代掌机吗
Is that a ps vita?

408
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,680
都有什么游戏
Which games does he have?

409
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,790
一应俱全
All of them.

410
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,930
我家有个游戏机
I have a console at home.

411
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,720
我常用来放松
I play sometimes to relax.

412
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,700
我该买台这个放车上
I ought to get one of these for the car.

413
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,470
彼得
So, Peter,

414
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,020
我们得关掉你选区的造船厂
we need to close the shipyard in your district.

415
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,340
明天军事基地整合委员会听证会
The BRAC hearing is tomorrow.

416
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,820
你不要努力争取
You won't put up your usual fight.

417
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,240
也不要提供任何证词
You have zero testimony to add.

418
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,310
我不能这么做
I can't do that.

419
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,960
你能的  彼得
Yes, you can, Peter.

420
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,560
我为那份证词准备了几个月
I spent months on that testimony.

421
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,900
还游说委员会  我们全体员工...
I lobbied the commission. My entire office...

422
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,440
我相信你一定做得很好
I'm sure you've done splendid work,

423
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,780
不幸的是  这事成不了
but unfortunately it can't come to fruition.

424
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,430
-为什么  -这就是政治
- Why? - Politics.

425
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,690
有些势力是你我无力抗衡的
There's forces bigger than either of us at play here.

426
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,240
那可是12000人的饭碗啊
It's 12,000 jobs.

427
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,390
我明白  真令人遗憾
I know. It's a shame.

428
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,800
我就是保住了那家造船厂才得以当选
Keeping that shipyard open is what got me elected.

429
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,090
那些人是我的朋友
Those people are my friends.

430
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,270
我来不是和你争这个的  彼得
I'm not here to debate this, Peter.

431
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,340
工厂必须关闭
The base will close.

432
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,530
唯一的问题是
The only question is,

433
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,970
你选择长痛还是短痛
will you make it a swift death or a painful one?

434
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,730
不行  我不能坐视不管
No way. I won't sit on my hands.

435
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,360
这对你很难  我表示同情
I sympathize that this is gonna be difficult for you.

436
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,320
现在我说不出
And I don't know how yet,

437
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,150
但将来我会弥补你的  彼得
but I will make it up to you, Peter.

438
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,070
对于你  我是个强大的朋友
I'm a powerful friend to have right now,

439
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,040
或许是你唯一的朋友
perhaps your only friend,

440
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,040
别违抗我
so don't defy me.

441
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,490
家庭之爱
Love of family.

442
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,740
大多数政客终生都被这句口号所束缚
Most politicians are permanently chained to that slogan...

443
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,230
"家庭价值"
family values.

444
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,280
要是你和妓女厮混  又被我发现
But when you cozy up to hookers and I find out,

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,900
你就得为这份虚伪付出代价
I will make that hypocrisy hurt.

446
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,920
收到我送你的礼物了吗
Did you get the present I sent you?

447
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,710
称不上是礼物吧
You wouldn't really call it a present.

448
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,430
更像是个温柔的提醒吧
Well, more of a gentle reminder, maybe.

449
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,900
不怎么温柔  挺粗暴的
Mm, more heavy-handed than gentle,

450
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,810
真没想到啊
which surprised me.

451
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,980
这不是你的风格  弗兰西斯
It's not really your style, Francis.

452
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,580
是的  我收到了
But, yes. I got it.

453
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,670
我喜欢这件
I like that one.

454
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,630
我也是
I do too.

455
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,240
但第一件更好
But the first one's better.

456
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,680
是吗
You think?

457
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,830

亚当・嘉乐威要从纽约过来
Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.

459
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,010
什么事
What for?

我需要他的一些照片
Because I need some of his photographs

461
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,650
下个月无声拍卖会上要用
for the silent auction at the gala next month.

462
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,650
跟雷米谈过了吗
You speak to Remy yet?

463
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,400
还没有
I haven't.

464
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,500
如果想显得诱惑些  穿黑色那件

465

你好

亚当
Adam?

468
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,860
世界瞬息万变
How is it the world keeps spinning

469
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,040
你却总能走在前面
and you manage to stay ahead of it?

470
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
大卫也同意了
David's on board with this?

471
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,210
这就是他的主意
It was his idea.

472
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,230
那他为什么没来
Then why isn't he here?

473
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,850
这事还没定下前  我们得小心
Well, we have to be careful until it's a done deal.

474
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,730
我说不好  弗兰克
I don't know, Frank.

475
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,810
想想看  泰瑞
Think about it, Terry.

476
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,650
你会成为美国国会首位
You could become the first African-American majority leader

477
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,040
非裔多数党领袖
in the United States congress.

478
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,110
我们一起创造历史吧
Let's make some history.

479
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,640
你才不在乎什么历史呢
You don't care about history.

480
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,800
你找我是因为我能拉到选票
You just wanted me because I can round up the votes.

481
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,530
我是需要选票  但历史我也是在乎的
I need the votes, and I do care about history,

482
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,260
但最重要的是  泰瑞
but most importantly, Terry,

483
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,900
你有领袖风范
you know how to lead.

484
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,710
你成为黑人党团领袖是不无原因的
You're the head of the black caucus for a reason.

485
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,210
那么大卫当议长  我当多数党领袖
So David becomes speaker, I become majority leader...

486
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,940
我仍然做我的党鞭
and I stay on as whip.

487
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,110
你为什么不自己当多数党领袖
Why don't you want majority leader for yourself?

488
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,850
我对现状很满意
I'm satisfied where I am.

489
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,470
或许等哪天  你做了议长
Maybe one day, when you become speaker,

490
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,870
会提拔一下我
you'll bump me up.

491
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,800
这种事一旦决定就没有回头路了
This is the sort of thing that there's no turning back.

492
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,880
我还能给你锦上添个花
I can throw a cherry on top.

493
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,510
麦喀顿基地不关闭
McCudden stays open.

494
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,950
怎么做
How?

495
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,480
着你不会想知道
You don't want to know how.

496
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,550
你只需要头条新闻
You just want the headline

497
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,400
你保住了选区内的三千份工作
when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

498
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
-12张选票  -12张选票
- 12 votes? - 12 votes.

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,160
我能给你搞定10张  或许11张
I can get you 10, probably 11.

500
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,000
和这样的人合作真令人振奋
It's so refreshing to work with someone

501
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,660
对到手的礼物不吹毛求疵
who will throw a saddle on a gift horse

502
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,430
而能让它物尽其用
rather than look it in the mouth.

503
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,370
这张很不错
That's nice.

504
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,330
我是在阿姆拉维蒂外的一个小镇上看到她的
I found her in a village outside Amravati.

505
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,030
她叫蒂阿拉
Her name was Tiala.

506
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,420
拍下这张照片后三周她就去世了
She died three weeks after I took that picture.

507
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,920
这太可怕了
Oh, that's awful.

508
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,100
如果你喜欢  就都给你
You can have them all if you like.

509
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,420
我喜欢你短发的样子
I love your hair short.

510
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,650
今晚有安排吗
Do you have plans tonight?

没有
No.

512
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,340
弗兰克会在家等你吗
Is Frank expecting you home?

513
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,220
我想他应该会很晚到家
I'm sure he'll be home late.

514
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,230
和我一起吃晚餐
Get dinner with me.

It was a mistake.

547
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,380

事实证明  确实如此

因为这个他们并不知道

610
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
他会觉得你策划了一场政变
He'll think you organized a coup,

611
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,270
半路退缩了  拿我当替罪羊
got cold feet, and are making me the scapegoat.

612
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,240
大卫  如果我现在拿起电话
David, if I pick up this phone right now

613
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,050
把这件事透露出去
and leak this story,

614
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,160
鲍勃就只能抛弃你
Bob will have no choice but to drop you,

615
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,380
即使他真的相信了你的话
even if he believes your version of events.

616
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,610
要不要坐下
You wanna take a seat?

617
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,670
弗莱迪烧烤餐馆

618
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,050
-弗莱迪  -什么事  弗兰克
- Uh, Freddy? - Yeah, Frank?

619
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,920
就给我来半份吧  晚上有晚宴
You better make it a half order. I got a big dinner tonight.

620
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,130
没问题
Sure thing.

621
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,330
生菜色拉
Slaw?

622
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,790
-老样子  -好咧
- Always. - You got it.

623
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,470
来了
Here you go.

624
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,330
最近怎么样
So, what's the latest?

625
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,580
你懂的  弗兰克  还是老样子
Oh, you know, Frank. Same old shit.

626
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,090
上周末差点没命了
Almost got killed last weekend.

627
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,550
-在这里  -不是
- Here? - No.

628
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,210
去弗吉尼亚展览会的路上
State fair down in Virginia.

629
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,860
我和弟弟开着改装车去那里
Me and my brother hauling this smoker down there,

630
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,180
有辆该死的小货车车顶绑着冰箱
and this fucking minivan had a fridge strapped on top.

631
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,250
冰箱绑在货车顶  弗兰克
A fridge strapped on top of a minivan, Frank.

632
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,510
太蠢了
That's stupid.

633
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,700
冰箱的绳结松了
Well, that fridge slipped loose.

634
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,990
轰隆一声砸在我们面前
Boom! Right in front of us.

635
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,920
我只能急左转  差点碰上
I had to swerve to the left. Barely missed it.

636
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,500
但这下我的车就摆尾行驶了
But now that smoker is fishtailing,

637
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,130
差点撞上邻车道的掀背车
almost hit a hatchback in the next lane.

638
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,660
再急右转  又差点出事
Swerved to the right. Barely missed that too.

639
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,820
-天哪  -老兄  是真的
- Jesus. - Oh, man, it was real.

640
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,990
所以上帝才会给我们反射弧
But, you know, that's why God gave us reflexes.

641
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,580
好躲开从天而降的冰箱
So we can move the fuck out of the way when a fridge come out of nowhere.

642
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,330
-肋排怎么样  -你知道的
- How them ribs? - You know how they are.

643
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,470
-我喜欢听你说  -完美  弗莱迪
- You know I like to hear it. - Perfection, Freddy.

644
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,260
无可挑剔
Perfection.

645
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,360
-你接着吃吧  弗兰克  -谢谢  弗莱迪
- You go on ahead, Frank. - Thank you, Freddy.

646
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,570
真是意外啊
Well, this is a surprise.

647
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,800
-你一般发短信  -你在哪
- You usually text. - Where are you?

648
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,110
逆道而行
On the other side of the tracks

649
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,150
试图寻找人生的意义
trying to find the meaning of life.

650
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,230
你为我找到什么了吗
Did you find anything for me?

651
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,210
你指有报导价值的事
You mean anything newsworthy?

652
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,000
其实我不是打来纠缠你的
Uh, I actually didn't call to badger you.

653
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,570
你就是  不过这也是你的魅力
Yes, you did, but that's part of your charm.

654
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,300
不是
No.

655
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,000
我想告诉你我刚被提升为
I wanted to tell you that I've been promoted to

656
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,790
驻白宫记者
White House correspondent.

657
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,390
我得随记者团到处走  参加通气会
I'll have to travel with the press corps, be at briefings,

658
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,210
但我可以应付得来
but I can work around all that.

659
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,430
如果你需要我  我还会一如既往
If you need me. It won't change anything.

660
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,800
正相反
Oh, on the contrary.

661
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,870
这改变了一切
This changes everything.

662
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,560
不  我很变通的
No. I can be flexible.

663
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,540
我对变通的人没兴趣
I'm not interested in someone who's flexible,

664
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,710
我只对有空的人感兴趣
I'm interested in someone who's available.

665
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,420
你是说我该拒绝
So you think I should turn it down?

666
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,390
这完全取决于你
That's entirely up to you.

667
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,760
好吧  还没正式确定
Well, I mean, it's not official yet.

668
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,090
-我可以  -我得挂了
- I could... - Oh, look, I've got to go,

669
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,630
等你又有空了  再打给我
but call me, you know, if you find yourself available again.

670
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,610
弗莱迪认为如果冰箱从小货车上掉下来
You see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan,

671
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,310
你得赶快避开
you better swerve out of its way.

672
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,760
我却认为冰箱该给我让道
I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine.

673
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,180
简宁
Hey, Janine...

674
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,370
走开  佐伊  我现在没心情和你聊
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't want to talk to you right now.

675
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,990
又不是我去找他的
It's not like I asked him for it.

676
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,620
-他把我叫进办公室  -拜托
- He just called me into his office, and... - Oh, please.

677
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,000
自从你含着棒棒糖蹦蹦来这儿工作
You've been gunning for my job since the day you bounced in here

678
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,700
就一直觊觎我的职位
with a lollipop in your mouth.

679
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,830
祝贺你
Congratulations.

680
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,400
我会从中西部给你寄瓶香槟
I'll send you a bottle of champagne from the Middle West,

681
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,040
不知道那是什么鬼地方
wherever the fuck that is.

682
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,950
我不会接受的  你不用走
I'm gonna turn it down. You don't have to leave.

683
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,560
你这是有意跟我显摆吗
Are you trying to rub this in or something?

684
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,320
请相信我  你该待在白宫
Please believe me. You should be in the White House.

685
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,670
我不想去  从来都不
I don't want it. I never did.

686
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,380
我希望我们能一起去见汤姆
I was hoping we could go see Tom together.

687
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,710
告诉他我们都
I want him to know that we both...

688
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,080
给我滚开
Get the fuck out of my face.

689
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,750
我在请求你  真心的
I'm asking. For real.

690
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,040
我不想要那份工作
I don't want the job.

691
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,500
那你比我想的还蠢
Then you're an even bigger idiot than I thought you were.

692
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,640
滚开  别逼我动手
Go. Before I get violent.

693
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,150
彼得
Peter?

694
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,290
有人吗
Hello?

695
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,760
但白令海的力量猛烈而难以捉摸
But the Bering Sea is a violent and unpredictable force.

696
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,330
我叫克里斯蒂娜
Hi. Uh, my name is Christina.

697
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,940
-你们爸爸的同事  -他不在
- I work with your dad. - He's not here.

698
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,520
-他去哪了  -我不知道
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

699
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
他说很快就回来
He said he'd be back in a little while.

700
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,570
什么时候说的
Uh, when was that?

701
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,700
把我们从学校接回来的时候
When he dropped us home from school.

702
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,110
他没带手机
He left his phone here.

703
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,690
你是爸爸的女朋友吗
Are you dad's girlfriend?

704
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,880
不  我
No. No. I, uh...

705
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,960
我不过是你们爸爸的下属
I just... I... I work for your dad.

706
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,310
那你为什么会有他公寓的钥匙
Then why do you have the keys to his apartment?

707
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,420
你能做点果酱馅饼吗
Will you make us pop-tarts?

708
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:56,410
18米的巨浪袭击阿留申群岛
An enormous 60-foot rogue wave struck the Aleutian...

709
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,510
真是丰盛可口  克莱尔
It was just sublime, Claire.

710
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,650
-谢谢  -我大概这个礼拜都不用进食了
- Thank you. - I don't think I'll eat for a week.

711
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,810
连甜点也不吃了吗
Does that mean no room for dessert?

712
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,790
真想吃  不过算了
I'd love to, but, uh, none for me.

713
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,190
那我们下楼去
Why don't you and I head downstairs

714
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,120
来点白兰地雪茄什么的
for a little Brandy and some cigars?

715
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,830
古巴雪茄吗
Cubans?

716
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,320
你觉得我会私藏违禁物品吗
You don't think I smoke anything legal, do you?

717
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,130
1962年2月7日  美国前总统肯尼迪对古巴实施禁运

718
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,260
-甜点要吗  -不  谢谢
- Dessert for you? - No. No, thanks.

719
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,050
不过我想再来点夏敦埃
But I will take a refill of this Chardonnay, though.

720
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,280
没问题
Of course.

721
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,620
这瓶快喝完了  我去再去拿一瓶
Oh, this is almost out. I'll grab another.

722
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,140
我也讨厌这样  突然就上来股劲
I hate how they just hit you like that with no warning.

723
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,230
你也盗汗吗
You get night sweats too?

724
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,950
我
I, uh...

725
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,920
我对这个没什么经验
This is very new to me.

726
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,720
弗兰克知道吗
Does Frank know?

727
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,660
我还没  我们  不
I haven't... we haven't... no.

728
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,320
对不起  我们没必要谈这个的
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about this.

729
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,200
不  没关系  只是
No. It's fine. I'm just, uh...

730
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,210
没事  我感觉好多了
It's fine. I feel better now.

731
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,210
-我可以再来一点吗  -当然
- Could I have a little bit more? - Sure.

732
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,940

-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

736
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,490
你邀我来的时候提到了净水计划
So, you mentioned, when you invited me, the C.W.I.

737
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,330
说是举办了活动庆祝新项目的开启
You're having a gala and launching some new...

738
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,930
对  是这样的
Yes, that's right.

739
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,690
我们刚请来一位非常棒的女士
We just brought on this brilliant young woman

740
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,030
她会帮我们开拓海外项目

741
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,240
-这样我们  -克莱尔
- So we'll... - Claire, I will

742
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,270

查尔斯和我非常乐意出力

00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,720
你真是太慷慨了  费莉希蒂
Well, that's very generous of you, Felicity.

745
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,910
你还好心
Well, you were such a darling,

746
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,550
帮我们弄到了杰弗逊舞会的入场券呢
getting us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

747
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,090
-举手之劳  -不  不止这样
- Oh, that was nothing. - It wasn't nothing.

748
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,420
这是
It was...

749
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,980
这座城市里的人  不会费心善待他人
People in this town don't go out of their way to be nice to each other.

750
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,780
查尔斯和我在这儿待了14年
Fourteen years Charles and I have been here, and...

751
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,360
总之
Anyway, um,

752
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,780
我很高兴能交到一位朋友
I'm grateful to have a friend.

753
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,470
你需要多少钱
How much do you need?

754
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,840
克里斯蒂娜  你怎么会在这里
Christina, what the fuck are you doing here?

755
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,250
小声点  他们睡了
Shh. They're sleeping.

756
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,590
彼得
Peter.

757
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,580
-爸爸好  -孩子们
- Hey, dad. - Hey, kiddo.

758
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,090
带你弟弟下楼好吗
Would you take your brother downstairs?

759
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,230
-我一会儿就来  -嗯  爸爸再见
- I'll be there in a second. - Okay. Bye, dad.

760
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,600
-再见  -为什么再见  他们要去哪
- Bye. - Bye? Where they going?

761
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,590
去他们奶奶那儿
I'm taking them to their grandmother's.

762
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,450
我联系上了玛德琳  跟她说...
I was able to get a hold of Madeleine, and I told her...

763
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,970
别跟我说你告诉她了
Oh, fuck. You didn't tell her?

764
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,490
没  不过我应该说的
No, I didn't. But I should have.

765
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,410
我说你要因公出差
I told her that you had to travel for work,

766
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,230
这是我最后一次为你说谎了
which is the last time I ever lie for you.

767
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,230
听着
Look...

768
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,050
究竟怎么回事  彼得
what happened, Peter?

769
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,540
听证会的事我很抱歉
I'm... I'm sorry about the Brack hearing.

770
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,440
-我  -去他妈的听证会
- I was... - Fuck the Brack hearing.

771
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
想想你的孩子
What about your kids?

772
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,890
我把他们送过去  我们就算完了
After I drop them off, I'm done.

773
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,580
我不再是你的女友  也不为你工作
I am no longer your girlfriend. I no longer work for you.

774
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,170
不  等等  克里斯蒂娜
No... hey, Christina...

775
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,660
我不想听  彼得
I don't want to hear it, Peter.

776
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,440
这次别想找借口
There's no excuse this time.

777
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,710
我很忙  弗兰克
I don't have much time, Frank.

778
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,040
我会长话短说
I'll make it short.

779
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,610
-关于总统吗  -不  关于议长
- The President? - No. The speakership.

780
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,150
大卫有所动作
David's making a play.

781
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,000
-什么  -他找我支持他
- What? - He came to me for support.

782
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,660
我一开始本想马上告诉你
My first thought was to tell you right away,

783
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,160
不过转念一想  算了
but then my second thought was to ignore my first thought,

784
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,040
我们票数够了  鲍勃
because we have the votes, Bob.

785
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,290
要是党内有情况  我不可能不知道
If there had been a party revolt, I would've known about it.

786
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,760
不需要全党反对  13人足以
We don't need the whole party to revolt. We need 13...

787
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,600
13个民主党  加上对立党派
13 Democrats, plus the other side of the aisle.

788
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,390
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

789
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,460
最近这么问的人挺多
People have been asking me that a lot lately.

790
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,390
我有点想回答"是的"
I'm inclined to start saying yes.

791
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,300
那13个是谁
Who are they... the 13?

792
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,170
大卫加我就是两个  泰瑞・乌麦克
David and I are two, Terry Womack,

793
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,280
黑人党团10个人  一共13个
and ten members of the black caucus make another 11.

794
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,590
总统的意思吗
Is the President behind this?

795
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,990
不  他完全不知道
No. He doesn't have a clue.

796
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,820
大卫策划的  我是跑腿的
This was David's plan executed by me.

797
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,290
你还是有生路的  鲍勃
But there is an out for you, Bob.

798
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,340
乌麦克哪边倒全听我的
I can sway Womack either way

799
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,840
前提是你让他成为下任多数党领袖
as long as you make him the next majority leader.

800
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,660
还有
And...

801
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,850
-教育法案  -这下你跟上我的思路了
- The education bill. - Now we're on the same page.

802
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,030
你知道我不能那么做
I can't do that. You know I can't.

803
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,330
你是议长  鲍勃  你做什么都行
You're the speaker, Bob. You can do anything you'd like.

804
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,550
我得说
And I have to say,

805
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,130
任命首位非裔美国人做多数党领袖
appointing the first African-American majority leader...

806
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,050
这可是宝贵的功绩啊
why, that isn't a bad legacy to have.

807
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,040
抱歉  我改主意了
I'm sorry. I changed my mind.

808
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,090
我考虑过了
I thought about it, and...

809
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,190
我给过你两天时间考虑了
Thinking about it was what those two days were for.

810
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,680
然后我又好好想了一下  我意识到
And then I thought about it some more, and I realized I...

811
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,480
上帝啊  你太不可理喻了
Jesus Christ, you're fucking unbelievable.

812
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,010
汤姆  我非常感激你给我机会  但...
Look, Tom, I appreciate the fact that you took a chance on me, but...

813
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,460
不  你才不会呢
No, I don't think you do.

814
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
你根本不懂感激
I don't think you appreciate anything.

815
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,710
你就是个忘恩负义  自以为是的小
I think you're an ungrateful, self-entitled little c...

816
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,120
小什么
Little what?

817
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,800
小什么  汤姆  说出来
Little what, Tom? Say it.

818
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,850
贱人  你是个贱人
Cunt. You're a cunt.

819
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,080
你在做什么
What are you doing?

820
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,910
你要是敢
Don't you dare...

821
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,750
你都不知道我在打什么
You don't even know what I'm typing.

822
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,950
-出去  佐伊  -等等  我快好了
- Get out, Zoe. - Just a second. I'm almost done.

823
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,410
出去  你被炒了
Get out. You're fired.

824
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,340
随你怎么说吧  汤姆
Whatever you have to tell yourself, Tom.

825
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,500
出去
Get out!

826
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,360
我应该按"发送"吗
So should I press "Send"?

827
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,470
我想是吧
I think I should.

828
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,070
随你怎么喊我
Call me whatever you want,

829
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,450
但别忘了  如今
but you should remember, these days,

830
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,980
信息的传播速度可非常快
when you're talking to one person, you're talking to a thousand.

831
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,210
华盛顿先驱报

832
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,190
你就说你想花更多时间
Well, you'll say you wanted to spend more time

833
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,100
专注于自己的选区
focusing on your home district.

834
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,350
乌麦克是接替你职位的不二人选
You'll say Womack is the right man to fill your shoes.

835
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,230
不要兴风作浪  不要接受采访
You won't make waves. You won't do interviews.

836
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,900
把苦咽下去  维护团队利益
You'll suck it up and be a team player.

837
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,430
这是弗兰克的主意
This was Frank's idea.

838
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,420
我就说他会把这都赖我头上
I told you he was gonna try to blame me on it.

839
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,830
到处去问问  和乌麦克谈谈
Ask around. Talk to Womack.

840
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,950
我谈过了  他说是你找他的
I did. He said you came to him.

841
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,240
他在撒谎  鲍勃  我绝不会...
He's fucking lying, Bob! I would never...

842
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,660
闭嘴  大卫
Shut up, David.

843
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,050
你知道我们宣布的时候该怎么做吗
Do you understand how you're to behave when we make the announcement?

844
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,410
如果我不合作呢
And if I don't play along?

845
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,570
那么民主党竞选委员会将在下届竞选中
Then the D-triple-C will pour everything it's got

846
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,590
倾尽所有支持你的主要对手
into your primary opponent's campaign next cycle.

847
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,470
我们会把你踢出局
We'll cleave you from the herd

848
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:33,040
看着你自生自灭
and watch you die in the wilderness.

849
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,620
马上做决定  大卫
Tell us now, David.

850
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,790
如你所愿  罗伯特
If you think it's best, Robert.

851
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,130
想想看  他本可以做头狼的
And just think, he could have been a wolf.

852
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,830
这下你有空了
You made yourself available.

853
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,410
我辞职了
I quit.

854
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,570
去那个鬼地方
Fuck that place.

855
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,850
就像监牢  现在我自由了
It was a prison. I'm free now.

856
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,490
恭喜
Congratulations.

857
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,590
你在哪里
Where are you?

858
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,000
-车里  -我也是
- In a car. - So am I.

859
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,160
你要去哪里
Where you headed?

00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,340
-回家  -我也是
- Home. - So am I.

861
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,220
回你家还是我家
To your home or mine?

862
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,900
这算邀请吗
Is that an invitation?

863
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:48,020
你说算就算
It's whatever you want it to be.

864
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,560
-你好像喝醉了  -是的
- You sound tipsy. - I am.

865
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,840
我刚喝了两小时的长岛冰茶
I just spent the last two hours drinking Long Island Iced Teas.

866
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,270
你家在哪里
What's your address?

867
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,460
你父母知道你住这种地方吗
Do your parents know you live like this?

868
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,940
不  他们没来过
No. They haven't visited.

869
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,900
有人照顾你吗
Are you cared for?

870
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,820
什么意思
How do you mean?

871
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,890
有男人照顾你吗
Do you have a man who cares for you?

872
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,440
-年长的男人  -没有
- An older man. - No.

873
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,850
但你以前和老男人处过
But you've been with older men before?

874
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,140
是的
Yes.

875
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,530
那你该知道他们会伤害你
Then you know they hurt you,

876
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,790
在那之后
and after they hurt you,

877
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,260
就会遗弃你
they discard you.

878
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,060
你伤不了我
You can't hurt me.

879
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,340
