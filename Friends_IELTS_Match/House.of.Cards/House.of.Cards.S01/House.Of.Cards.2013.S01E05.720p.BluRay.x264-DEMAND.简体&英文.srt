1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,770
你觉得达伦・贾维斯怎么样
What do you think of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,620
CBS: 哥伦比亚广播公司

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,620
-CBS的吗  -他想聘我作记者
- At CBS? - He wants me to be a correspondent.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,190
不值得
Not worth your time.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,650
MSNBC: 微软全国有线广播电视公司

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,650
MSNBC的格里尔・菲舍呢
What about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,190
继续撰稿
Stick to writing.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,640
电视只作为副业
Do TV on the side.

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,690
你作主播大材小用了
You're more than a talking head.

10
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,580
-去头条网呢  -那是什么地方
- How about Slugline? - What's Slugline?

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,360
如果政治新闻网要雇我  你觉得怎么样
If I said Politico wanted to hire me, what would you say?

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,910
我觉得那还有点意思
I would say that that peaks my interest.

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,080
半年后的头条网
Six months from now,

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,020
就是一年半前的政治新闻网
Slugline will be what Politico was a year and a half ago.

15
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,990
政治新闻网的人都看头条网
Everyone at Politico reads it,

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,200
因为头条网的报道总比他们快
because Slugline's breaking stories before they are.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,840
我怎么从没听说过
I wonder why I've never heard of it.

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,990
头条网的记者都是自由撰稿人
Everyone's a free agent.

19
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,380
报道什么都行  随时随地撰稿
They write whatever they want, wherever they are.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,120
很多人直接用手机写稿
Most people write from their phones.

21
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,270
如果他们给你自由和曝光率
Well, if freedom and exposure are what they're offering,

22
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,930
我觉得值得一试
I would say that is a meeting worth taking.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,520
汉默施密特的事开始爆发了
This Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up.

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,760
我觉得他可能会被解雇
I think he might get fired.

25
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,380
推特上起码有上千条评论
There's gotta be 1,000 tweets here.

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,990
支持我的  诋毁我的
People defending me, people trashing me.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,130
甚至还有个标签  "佐伊加油"
There's even a hashtag-- "Gozoe."

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,780
可不能留下蛛丝马迹
We mustn't leave any trails.

29
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,380
可我的联络人都在里面啊
All of my contacts are in there.

30
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,230
那你就该去找些新联络人了
Then it's time for you to get some new contacts.

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,370
别担心  我会给你买部新的  买两部新的
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone. I'll get you two, in fact.

32
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,600
一部工作  一部一次性的用于娱乐
One for work and a burner for play.

33
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,280
等着下午签收吧
Expect them this afternoon.

34
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,680
对了  佐伊  加油  
Oh, and go, Zoe.

35
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,580
是那个记者吗
The reporter?

36
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,180
是的
Yes.

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,450
就这一次吗
Just this once?

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,020
我不确定
I'm not sure.

39
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,870
她能为我们做什么
What does she offer us?

40
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,940
能在必要时替我们传话
A mouthpiece when we need one.

41
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,240
到目前为止她很有帮助
She's been very useful so far.

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,120
-她想换取什么  -门路
- What does she want? - Access.

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,390
地位
A seat at the table.

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,260
听起来是她的收益比较大
Sounds like she's getting the better side of the bargain.

45
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,950
我能控制她
She can be controlled.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,130
你确定
Are you sure?

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,890
是的  我保证
She can. I promise you.

48
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,440
好吧  但愿如此
Okay. If you say so.

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,770
如果你让我结束...
The moment you want me to end it--

50
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,170
我知道  弗兰西斯
I know, Francis.

51
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,820
我该准备一下去上班了
I should get ready for work.

52
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,340
我以为你过会儿才会来
Didn't think you'd be in till later.

53
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,470
这是你今天的日程表
This is your agenda for the day.

54
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,510
这是这周的日程表
Here's your schedule for the rest of the week.

55
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,900
这些是需要你批准和签署的文件
These are papers that need to be approved or signed.

56
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,600
这里是委员会会议的提纲
Over here are your one-sheets for committee meetings

57
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,900
和随后立法工作的简报
and briefs on upcoming legislative action.

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,970
我跟艾什利交待了  在你找到替任者前她会替我
I filled Ashley in. She can cover until you find a replacement.

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,590
克里斯蒂娜
Christina...

60
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,300
怎么了
What?

61
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,130
谢谢你
Thank you...

62
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,560
把这些都整理好了
for getting all this in order.

63
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,000
如果对桌上的文件
Ashley can call me

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,140
有什么问题  可以让艾什利打电话问我
if you have any questions about what's on your desk.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,980
他已经到了吗
Is he here yet?

66
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,280
我请他在办公室等你了
I put him in your office.

67
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,710
马蒂・斯比奈拉是教师工会的首席说客
Marty Spinella, head lobbyist for the teachers' union.

68
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,240
他恨不得拧断我的头  剥我的皮
He wants to rip my head off and peel it like an orange.

69
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,100
为什么  因为我对他撒谎了  可我也没办法
Why? Because I lied to him. But what choice did I have

70
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,370
如果我说真话  那就没得可谈判了
when the truth would've ended the conversation before it began?

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,660
-我等会儿打给你  -马蒂
- I'll call you back. - Marty.

72
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,060
你竟然骗我  弗兰克
You fucking lied, Frank?

73
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,460
不  你是当面骗我
No, no. You lied to my fucking face?

74
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,280
-马蒂  我没撒谎  -没有是吧
- Marty, I did not lie. - Did not--

75
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,190
我们整个周末都待在那间会议室里
We spent the whole weekend in that room

76
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,830
一条一条地讨论这项法案
pouring over this bill line by line,

77
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,560
但里面完全没提到集体谈判
and nowhere did it say anything about collective bargaining.

78
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,860
镇定点  坐下来  我们好好谈谈
Let's calm down and sit down, and we will discuss this.

79
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,870
我会对一切作出解释
I will explain everything that's going on,

80
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,810
不管花多长时间  我们会把这事谈妥的
and we will talk it out no matter how long it takes.

81
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,380
不  不用长谈了
No, no more. This is gonna be a very short meeting,

82
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,780
因为摆在你面前的只有两条路
'cause only one of two things are gonna happen:

83
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,550
要么你立即向我保证删除那条修正案
either you assure me right now that amendment is out,

84
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,320
要么我这就离开
or I'm walking out that door

85
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,570
然后开始回击你
and I'm gonna start launching missiles.

86
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,070
我们本来也没想把修正案留在法案里
The amendment was never intended to stay in the bill.

87
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,690
它只是个筹码  仅此而已
It was just there for leverage, that's all.

88
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,560
你威胁要减少联邦政府对
You threatened to cut federal funding

89
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,680
公立学校的拨款啊
from union school districts?

90
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,080
那可不是筹码  弗兰克
That's not a poker chip, Frank.

91
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,610
那就是颗脏弹
That's a goddamn dirty bomb.

92
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,090
修正案不会留在法案里
Look, the amendment is not staying in the bill.

93
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,740
我只求在绩效标准上有个商量
I just need you to work with me on performance standards.

94
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,040
绩效标准
Performance standards?

95
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,940
你什么玩笑
Are you fucking kidding me?

96
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,050
你已经答应删掉这条
You agreed that they were already out!

97
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,490
怎么能出尔反尔
You can't just put them back in!

98
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,070
-马蒂  听我说  -我还要维护我的声誉
- Marty, look-- - I have a reputation to uphold!

99
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,540
你在加夫尼玩你的大桃子时
I am the one that made the union reps stay here for you

100
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,060
是我帮你把工会代表留在了这儿
while you were in Gaffney playing with your fucking Peachoid!

101
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,420
-马蒂  -马上告诉我  到底留不留那条
- Marty-- - You tell me right now! Is that amendment in or out?

102
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,670
我们可以相互妥协  马蒂
There is a middle ground here, Marty.

103
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,330
我们只需找到平衡点
We just have to find it.

104
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,580
那就还是要了
I take that as a no.

105
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,000
好吧
Okay.

106
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,770
马蒂  别挑起一场你必输的仗
Marty, do not start a war you know you're gonna lose.

107
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,160
你耍我  我就奉陪到底
You fuck me, I fuck back.

108
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,950
斯坦普
Stamper!

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,480
马蒂与我一直合作愉快
Marty and I have a good working relationship.

110
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,580
至少曾经愉快  他脾气不小
Or used to. You can see he has a temper,

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,110
但我通常都能做通他工作
but I can usually cut through that and reason with him.

112
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,490
我可能逼人太甚了  有点令人担心
But I may have pushed him too far, which is worrisome.

113
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,360
反目的朋友是最可怕的敌人
Friends make the worst enemies.

114
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,710
-怎么样  -你听到了什么
- How'd it go? - What did you hear?

115
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,510
-叫骂  -那不就是了
- A lot of "fucks." - Well, that pretty much says it.

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,690
我们好好想想
Let's think this through.

117
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,800
我们得参加民主党全国委员会首脑会晤
We've got the D.N.C. leadership meeting.

118
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,540
-什么  -本来你不非得去
- What? - I'd say you could skip it,

119
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,090
但博奇刚把这任务丢给我们
but Birch just dumped it on us.

120
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,500
-什么时候  -在这里  12分钟后
- When? - It's here in 12 minutes.

121
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,140
为什么要在这里不在总部
Why here and not the D.N.C. headquarters?

122
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,880
总部正在装修
The D.N.C. is doing renovations.

123
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,540
他们要改造得节能环保
They're gonna be green energy efficient.

124
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,140
真会花党内资金
Oh, that's a charming use of party funds.

125
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,340
我们刚搬来三个月
We've only been in this space about three months.

126
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,500
真棒
It's cool.

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,620
和《先驱报》差很多吧
Not exactly the Herald, is it?

128
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,720
你去过他们办公室吗
Have you been to those offices?

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,220
去过  真让人想切腕
Yes. Wrist-slitting was in order.

130
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,530
还有谁找过你
So, who else is courting you?

131
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,440
-有那么几个  -那就是都有了
- A few people. - You mean everyone.

132
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,990
早上的确收到不少邮件
There were a lot of e-mails this morning.

133
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,160
不难想象  现在你风头正旺
That's not surprising. You're having a moment.

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,710
很多人对你感兴趣  我也是其中之一
People are interested. I'm one of them.

135
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,510
一件事做8分钟  我就会觉得无聊
But if eight minutes passes on anything, I get bored.

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,360
8分钟后  我可能会觉得你无聊
In eight minutes, I can be bored with you,

137
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,800
除非你能不断激起我的兴趣
unless you keep me interested.

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,770
我觉得你能做到
I think you can.

139
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,210
而这个地方
And I think this is the place

140
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,590
能让你抓住整个世界的兴趣
for you to keep the rest of the world interested too.

141
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,960
决定权在你  我不会死皮赖脸
It's your call. I won't chase you.

142
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,520
这很吸引我
I'm definitely tempted.

143
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,680
你随便逛
Take as long as you want to look around.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,790
薪酬数发给我  我会回电告诉你还价
E-mail me your figure. I'll call you back with a counter.

145
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,190
这几个是重点
This is our top priority--

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,140
此三州都是大选中的摇摆州

147
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,140
俄亥俄  佛罗里和宾夕法尼亚
Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania.

148
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,010
必须全部搞定  否则沃克无法连任
We need all of them, or Walker's a one-term president.

149
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,480
他选马修斯为竞选伙伴就是为了宾州
Pennsylvania is why he picked Matthews as a running mate.

150
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,340
但我们现在得找个替任
But now we have to find a replacement.

151
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,020
补选在11月
The special election is this November.

152
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,220
帕特里夏・惠特克  民主党全国委员会主席
Patricia Whittaker, D.N.C. Chair.

153
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,690
极少数用大脑而不是屁股
A rare example of someone whose head is in the game

154
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,640
思考的人
instead of up their backside.

155
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,020
能力在这群人中凤毛麟角
Competence is such an exotic bird in these woods

156
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,450
每碰到有能力的人我都很欣赏
that I appreciate it whenever I see it.

157
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,690
对国会也有影响
This also affects the House.

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,650
新州长将负责重划选区
The new governor will oversee redistricting.

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,840
在这儿丢了席位
We lose seats here,

160
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,590
会导致在国会失去多数席位
that means we could lose our majority in Washington.

161
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,890
共和党支持杰克・斯沃夫  匹兹堡的前市长
Well,the R.N.C. is backing Jack Swofford,ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh.

162
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,630
他在全州有知名度
He's got statewide name recognition

163
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,250
竞选也准备充分
and campaign machinery in place.

164
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,330
三个月过去了  我们却还没有人选
It's been three months, and we don't have dick.

165
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,240
那个司法部长怎么样  本・普拉克特
What about the A.G.? Ben Pluckett?

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,770
不行  本14年要竞选参议员
No. Ben's got his eyes set on the senate in '14.

167
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,710
他不会成功的
Which he'll lose because

168
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,050
他去年搞砸了一起性侵钓鱼执法的案子
he botched a sex offender sting last year.

169
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,470
-麦克霍兰德总可以吧  -他78了
- There's always McHolland. - He's 78.

170
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,130
上次他在职的时候  卡特还是总统吧
When's the last time he held office, when Carter was president?

171
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,770
里根  不过差不多
Reagan, but same difference.

172
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,930
他受人尊敬  举止庄重
He has dignity, he has gravitas.

173
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,600
如果要找人替马修斯的话
If you need someone to fill Matthews' shoes--

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,700
我们根本就不该找人去代替马修斯
You can't fill Jim Matthews' shoes, so we shouldn't even try.

175
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,950
得找张新面孔
We need a fresh face.

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,980
但这个州的候选人都不怎么样
The state has a weak bench.

177
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,050
那就一个个过现任议员
Let's go through all the sitting Congressmen one by one

178
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,890
看看有没有谁脱颖而出
and see if anybody sticks out from the crowd.

179
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,420
名单在这里
All right. I got the list right here.

180
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,690
很好  开始
Okay. Go ahead.

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,520
宾夕法尼亚第一选区  彼得・罗素
Pennsylvania's first district, Peter Russo.

182
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,330
划掉  他不行  没经验  能力一般
Cross him off. He's no good. No experience, no chops.

183
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:14,400
继续  第二选区  格温多林・皮尔斯
Okay, moving on. Second district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

184
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,530
格温争议太大  在堕胎问题上太极端
Nah, Gwen's too controversial. Very vocal on abortion.

185
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,630
-卡洛琳呢  -她不错
- And Caroline? - She's good.

186
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,810
-小伙子们怎么样  -你问他们四个
- And the boys? - All fucking four of 'em?

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,110
你养四张嘴试试
You feed 'em.

188
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,160
你手机上有他们的照片吗
You got any pictures on your phone?

189
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,050
得了  彼得  就别废话了  好吗
Come on. Let's cut the shit, Pete, will ya?

190
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,000
船厂你打算怎么办
What are we gonna do about the shipyard?

191
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,330
军事基地整合委员会的听证会已经结束了
BRAC had their hearing.

192
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,980
他们要关闭那里
They slated it for closing.

193
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,860
你当时怎么不作证
Yeah, and why didn't you testify?

194
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,630
这可是12000个工作岗位
We're talking 12,000 jobs here.

195
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,250
我也没办法  保罗  有人要关掉它
My hands were tied, Paul. People wanted it closed.

196
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,550
-我压力很大  -谁给你的压力
- I was under a lot of pressure. - From who?

197
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,190
位高权重的人
People high up the food chain.

198
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,990
-我无能为力  -放屁
- There was nothing I could do. - That's bullshit!

199
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,930
你去找委员会  和外交部交涉
You go back to BRAC. You talk to the D.O.D.

200
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,210
找海军部长谈  总之做点什么
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy. You do something.

201
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,380
不可能
It's not gonna happen.

202
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,260
-为什么  -我说了  政治原因
- Okay. Why not? - I told you. It's political.

203
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,340
好  那你让我回造船厂协会
Okay, So I'm supposed to go back to the shipbuilders' association

204
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,050
怎么跟他们说
and say what now exactly?

205
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,280
他们都因为彼得・罗素的弄权而丢了工作吗
That they're out of work because Pete Russo's playing politics?

206
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,450
天呐  彼得
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

207
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,260
是我们支持你赢得了选举
We're the ones who got you fucking elected in the first place.

208
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,220
现在你却要背叛我们
Now you're gonna turn your back on us?

209
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,110
你该走了
You should go.

210
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,300
你说真的
Seriously?

211
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,440
我才刚到  你就赶我走
I just got here. You're kicking me out now?

212
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,080
我在和你说话
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you!

213
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,250
我以为我们是一起长大的朋友
I thought we grew up together.

214
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,000
但这个坐在大办公桌后面的人
But this guy sitting behind his big desk...

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,410
我根本不知道他是谁
I don't even know who the fuck he is.

216
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,420
那个被逼入绝境
Where's the Pete Russo who knew how

217
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,640
也要誓死反抗的彼得哪去了
to throw a punch when his back was against the wall?

218
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,650
那个人才是我的朋友
That guy was my friend.

219
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,620
放假前一个月拉拢整个国家的老师
Every teacher in the country a month before school ends?

220
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,660
不用全拉拢  15  20个州就足够了
Doesn't need all of them. 15, 20 states, that's all.

221
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,900
美国教师联合会和全国教育协会向来有分歧
The A.F.T. And the N.E.A. can't agree on anything.

222
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,150
你低估了马蒂・斯比奈拉的能力
You underestimate Marty Spinella.

223
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,300
那我们去找谁
So which one do we target?

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,620
全国教育协会的可能性更高
We have a better chance with the N.E.A.

225
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,250
你认为查克・斯隆会上钩
You think Chuck Sloan will bite?

226
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,810
合作  我们就保护你的人
Cooperate-- we'll give your people protection

227
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,330
提升你的地位
and a place at the banquet.

228
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,970
反抗  我们就毁了你
Fight us, we break you.

229
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,960
他会上钩的  给他打电话
He'll bite. Get him on the phone.

230
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,080
现在凌晨两点多了
It's after 2:00.

231
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,350
斯比奈拉正在策动
Spinella is potentially mobilizing

232
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,630
美国历史上最大规模的教师罢工
the largest teachers' strike in United States history.

233
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,070
-没人睡得着  -我这就打给他
- Nobody's sleeping. - I'll call him right now.

234
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,610
抱歉  我们声音太大了吗
I'm sorry. Are we being too loud?

235
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,620
有点
A little.

236
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,430
-你在忙什么  -庆典
- What are you working on? - The gala.

237
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,930
要做的事太多
There's so much to do.

238
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,310
-南茜把我的名单发给你了吗  -发了
- Did Nancy send you my list? - She did.

239
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,830
-你怎么看  -名单不错
- What'd you think? - It's a good list.

240
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,400
谢谢你邀请他们
Thanks for inviting them.

241
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,680
有什么问题吗
Is something wrong?

242
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,820
还是没法和雷米提出的价码比
It's still not anywhere near what Remy brought to the table.

243
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,490
桑科提的数是150万美元  弗兰西斯
Sancorp offered 1.5 million, Francis.

244
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,540
我在计算  只能弄到50万左右
I'm adding up the numbers, and we're only at half a million.

245
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,950
-我接通查克的电话了  -稍等
- I got Chuck on the phone. - In a minute.

246
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,570
我可以再打几个电话
I can make more calls.

247
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,450
能筹到150万吗
Enough to raise a million-five?

248
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,440
至少可以接近这个数字
I can at least get us closer.

249
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,070
我去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

250
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,210
别动这些东西
Don't move any of this around.

251
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,680
克莱尔  我们一致决定了拒绝雷米
Claire, we made the decision to turn Remy down.

252
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,000
我没强迫你  
No one forced you.

253
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,670
我以为这事已经过去了
I thought we were okay on this.

254
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,640
你说的没错
You're right.

255
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,430
晚安  弗兰西斯
Good night, Francis.

256
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,180

259
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,660
再次感谢你的照片
to thank you again for the photographs.

260
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,490
它们一定会在拍卖会上大卖

祝你安好

264
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,520
这边走  汉默施密特先生
Right this way, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

265
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,200
他来了
He's here.

266
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,500
下午好  汤姆
Good afternoon, Tom.

267
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,790
律师
Legal?

268
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,660
你说了  还是没说
Did you say it, or didn't you?

269
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,740
对你以及所有问这个问题的人
To you and to anyone who asks,

270
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,280
是的  我说了
yes, I did.

271
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,980
我们真的需要他们吗
Do we really need them?

272
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,080
除非你要找我的麻烦
Not unless I should expect a fight.

273
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,300
我不会
You shouldn't.

274
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,530
请让我们单独待会儿
Give us a few moments.

275
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,030
重点不在于你怎么骂她了
It's not what you called her,

276
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,990
而是在于你辞退了她
it's that you let her leave the building.

277
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,810
我知道怎么运作报社  玛格丽特
I know how to run a paper, Margaret.

278
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,440
但我不知道怎么跟
What I don't know how to do

279
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,420
不听话的员工一起运作报社
is run a paper staffed with people I can't control.

280
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,830
真有那么严重吗
Was she really out of control?

281
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,830
据我了解  她不过是拒绝了一个新职位
To my understanding, she simply turned down a new position.

282
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,620
是态度  她拒绝时的态度
It's her attitude. It's the way she turned it down.

283
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,190
你问过她更想做什么吗
Did you think to ask her what she'd rather do instead?

284
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,530
-难道要我迎合我的雇员  -是我的雇员
- Is it my job to pander to all my employees-- - My employees.

285
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,880
如果他们能提供你给不了东西
And if they have something to offer that you don't,

286
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,420
没错  你就得迎合
yes, it is your job.

287
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,270
我们谈过的  汤姆
We've been through this, Tom.

288
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,000
报社在亏损
The paper's operating at a loss.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,970
我们需要佐伊这样的人
We need people like Zoe.

290
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,290
我很清楚我们的处境  玛格丽特
I'm very aware of how much we're hurting, Margaret.

291
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,650
裁员  削减发行量
Staff reductions, dip in circulation.

292
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,870
一想到他们的脸
Each one of those faces

293
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,990
和每个失去的订户
and every subscriber we lose,

294
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,510
我晚上就睡不着觉
they keep me awake at night.

295
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,590
生意上的事我不插嘴
Now, I won't argue the business side of things.

296
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,900
我既没资格  也不擅长
It's neither my place nor my area of expertise,

297
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,510
但要知道
but know this--

泛滥的媒体
enriched media,

300
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,050
这些都太肤浅了
they're all surface.

301
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,060
不过是昙花一现
They're fads.

302
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,800
这些既不是这份报纸的根基
They aren't the foundation this paper was built on,

303
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,080
也不会让它繁荣
and they aren't what will keep it alive.

304
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,280
我们的核心读者渴望严肃新闻
We have a core readership that thirsts for hard news.

305

为了他们我才每周工作80小时

307
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,500

我让你自己待会儿吧
I'll give you some privacy.

310
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,840
不用了  你留下吧  我马上就好

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,140
我们俩喝一杯
We'll get a drink.

312
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
我们先在华盛顿展开罢工
We're going to launch right here in Washington.

313
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,670
当放羊的学生都涌上街头
We'll see how Congress likes it when the streets are

314
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,280
看国会是个什么反应
teaming with unsupervised school kids.

315
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,310
然后逐渐在全国铺开
Then we'll phase out the rest of the country.

316
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,260
大家等我一分钟
Everybody hold on for one minute.

317
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,250
什么事
What's up?

318
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,470
全国教育协会不干了
The N.E.A. is out.

319
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,490
等等  什么
Hang on.What?

320
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,710
他们撤出了
They pulled out.

321
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,130
为什么
Why?

322
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,110
他不肯说
He wouldn't say.

323
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,790
再等一分钟
Hold on for one more minute.

324
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,890
立刻接通查克・斯隆的电话

328
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,410
听着  你不能这么做
Listen, you can't do this.

329
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,050
要是我们现在不团结  就没有
If we don't stay united now, we don't have a--

330
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,430
你雇我来维护你的利益  对吗
You hired me to represent your interests, right?

331
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,270
你这样我还怎么为教师游说
How can I possibly lobby for the teachers

332
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,420
让国会看到我们连个联合罢工都做不到
when Congress sees us splintering before we even put up a unite--

333
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,450
好吧
All right.

334
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,860
安德伍德找过你了
Did Underwood get to you?

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,860
弗兰克满口谎话  手段狡猾
Whoa, Frank is dishonest and manipulative.

336
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,750
你知道他已经骗过我们一次了
You've seen that he's lied to us already.

337
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,000
等等  查克  查克
Wait-whoa-whoa-whoa, Chuck, Ch-Ch-Chuck?

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,950
查克

339
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,290
狗娘养的混蛋
Son of a bitch!

340
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,090
-你在哪里  -办公室

341
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,540

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,850
这人做错了什么
What did this person do wrong?

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,070
骗我
Lie to me.

348
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,240
你要怎样惩罚他
How will you punish him?

349
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,530
你为什么觉得是个男的
What makes you think it's a him?

350
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,420
等等  我接个电话
Hold on. I have to take this.

351
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,790
你在哪
Where are you?

352

你要每周都给我个新手机吗
You're going to give me a new one of these every week?

354
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,460
我不能继续...
Well, I-- I can't continue to--

355
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,570
得有保护措施才行
Not without protection.

356
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,050
没人能管我该做什么
Nobody tells me when to work and when to play.

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,600
我不是不讲理  佐伊
I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.

358
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,250
你要是不信我  我们就不该这么做
If you can't trust me, we shouldn't be doing this at all.

359
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,850
好吧  那我们要怎么建立信任呢
Well, then, how do we establish our trust?

360
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,750
我一直很谨慎
I have been very discreet.

361

你的手机有摄像头
You have a camera on your phone.

那种不能让爸爸看到的照片

366
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,260
尺度得再大点

367
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,970
躺下
Lie back.

368
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,350

-我们检查过了  爸爸  -真的吗

371
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,220
厨房台面上的粉红耐克是我的吗

还有你  汽车人  
And you, Autobot,

373
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,920
擎天柱怎么在我床底下呢
what is Optimus Prime doing under my bed?

374
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,860
你明天出发前
He better transform himself

375
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,740
他最好变形进你的行李里
into your backpack before you have to leave tomorrow.

376
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,560
爸爸
Hey, dad?

377
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,030
克里斯蒂娜还会回来吗
Is Christina coming back?

378
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,630
我想不会了  宝贝  不会了
Um, I don't think so, buddy. No.

379
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,210
我喜欢她

380
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,080
我也是  她挺不错
Me, too. She's cool.

381
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,620
是啊
Yeah, she is cool.

382
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,880
你们得刷牙了
And you guys gotta brush your teeth

383
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,600
然后再把房间检查一遍
and then check the rooms again,

384
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,300
就可以上床睡觉了
and then it's time for bed.

385
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,900
懂了吗  小南瓜们
Got it, pumpkins?

386
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,560
爸爸  我讨厌你叫我们小南瓜
Dad, you know I hate it when you call us pumpkins.

387
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,010
快去  否则把你们做成南瓜派
Go before I turn you into a pie.

388

他目前是  而且很能干

想想他戒酒会是什么样子
Imagine if he was sober.

392

即使如此  你让他去竞选州长
Even so, you run him for governor,

393
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,860
人们会去翻他的前科
people are going to dig into his past.

394
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,340
那我们就化劣势为优势
Well, we turn that into an asset, not a liability.

395
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,540
曾经堕落  现在脱胎换骨了
Here's who I was. Here's who I am now.

396
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,480
你也看到首脑会晤上
You saw how they dismissed him

397
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,340
他们想都没想就否定了他
in three seconds at the leadership meeting.

帕特・惠特克非常开明

能从费城南部的街道

爬到国会圆形大厅的人都有野心

403
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,230
我们只要激起这份野心
We just need to tap into that,

404
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,510
给他最优秀的人才
surround him with the best people

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,020
那你觉得他能赢
So you think he could win.

407
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,990
我认为他有能力一争
I think he can be a contender.

00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,200
好吧  假设奇迹出现了  他赢了
Okay, let's say we pull off a miracle and he wins.

409
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,850
这对我们有什么好处
What do we gain by it?

410
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,860
掌控着这场竞选
Isn't it better to be holding the reins in this race

411
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,690
不比当个旁观者好吗
than watching from the stands?

412
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,000
你夫人来电
You wife is on the phone.

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,470
接进来
Put her through in here.

414
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,880
我明白宾州对选区重划的重要性
I understand that Pennsylvania's important for redistricting--

415
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,110
不  不仅是为了竞选  道格

开拓思路
Expand your thinking.

417
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,190
还有谁是宾州人
Who else is from Pennsylvania?

418
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,190
不对  不是众议院里的人
No, no, no, not in Congress.

419

南希拿我的西装去干洗了

今晚庆典的酒店
The hotel, for tonight's gala.

429
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,950
他们不让克莱尔的人进宴会厅
They refused to let Claire into the ballroom

430
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,540
因为他们的雇员是工会的

他怎么冲我来都可以
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants,

433
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,890
居然动我老婆
but to go after my wife?

434
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,240
真下作  我们在科茨沃斯酒店碰面

为什么不干脆去别处办

我查过了  到处都有预约了

443
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,330
都是我的错  我很内疚
This is my fault. I feel awful.

444
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,520
这可事关50万
There's a half a million on the line here.

445
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,220
这我知道
I realize that.

446
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,360
我不能总让我的工作
And I can't keep having my work

447
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,860
因为你的而受影响
take these hits on behalf of yours.

448
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,660
这已经不是小麻烦了
It's more than just an inconvenience.

449
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,310
我知道  问题会解决的
I know. We'll solve it.

450
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,800
-我收到了你的邮件  -觉得怎样
- Hey, I just got your email. - What did you think?

451
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,030
发稿不需要先经过我
You don't have to send me things before you post.

452
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,490
我以为你会想先看一下
Oh, I thought you might want to take a look.

453
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,740
我们的目标是让我来不及读
The goal here is for everyone to post things

454
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,470
你们就发布了
faster than I have a chance to read them.

455
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,900
只要你自己满意  就可以发布
If you're satisfied with the article, just put it up.

456
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,580
-好的  -你满意吗
- Okay. - Are you satisfied?

457
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,780
我觉得还行
I think so.

458
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,480
好吧  要么满意要么不满意
Okay, you are or you aren't.

459
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,890
《先驱报》逼你耍的那些把式
Whatever hoops the Herald made you jump through--

460
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,500
-我知道  -忘掉就好
- I know. - ...Let them go.

461
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,940
固执己见没什么错  佐伊
It's okay to be opinionated, Zoe,

462
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,870
出去挖新闻也没什么错
and it's okay to go outside to get your hands dirty.

463
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,180
你不需要坐在桌前
You're no longer tied to a desk.

464
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,830
或者是那个垫子
Or that pillow, for that matter.

465
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,910
我不发了
I'm not going to post it.

466
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,120
中期预测不算新闻
Midterm predictions-- they're not news.

467
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,890
纯属胡扯
They're bullshit.

468
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,040
我同意
Well, I agree.

469
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,880
我可以做得更好
I can do better.

470
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,220
我相信你可以
I think you can.

471
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,400
欢迎你给我惊喜
Feel free to blow my mind.

472
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,810
如果我们接这个活儿  全体员工就罢工
If we do this event, the whole staff walks out.

473
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,490
我有三百位客人
I've got 300 guests--

474
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,080
你和我太太签了合同
You signed a contract with my wife.

475
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,650
我们会把钱退给您太太的组织
We'll refund your wife's organization

476
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,520
并补偿将活动移至更合适地点的
and pay for whatever the costs of moving the event to a more

477
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,320
一切费用
appropriate venue.

478
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,150
我们得退回50万美元的捐款
And we would have to refund a half a million dollars in donations.

479
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,460
这个你们也能补偿吗
Can you pay for that, too?

480
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,790
因为我确信这是致损原因
Because I'm pretty sure there's cause for damages here.

481
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,520
十分抱歉  先生
I truly apologize, sir.

482
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,700
你老板是谁
Who's your boss?

483
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,630
我请示过业主们
I spoke with the owners,

484
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,950
他们允许我来做最佳选择
and they authorized me to do what I think is best.

485
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,200
那他们知道他们将41名国会议员
And do they realize that they are shutting the door on 41 members

486
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,250
拒之门外了吗
of the United States Congress?

487
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,860
是的  先生  他们明白
Yes, sir, they do.

488
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,180
我做了一个非常艰难的判断
I had to make a very hard judgment call.

489
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,790
我严重质疑你的判断能力
Well, I seriously question your judgment.

490
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,170
要知道  话传得很快
You know, word travels fast in this town.

491
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,610
那么多午餐会  会议和晚宴
All those luncheons and conventions and dinners.

492
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,910
失去这么多生意真是可惜
It's going to be a shame to lose all that work. Isn't it?

493
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,240
议员  您说的很对
Congressman, you are absolutely right,

494
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,300
但是如果我的员工罢工  我
but if my staff walks out, I--

495
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,990
请您理解我的窘境
Please understand the predicament I'm in.

496
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,430
我有办法了
I got an idea.

497
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,230
我知道该怎么办了
I know what we're going to do.

498
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,270
亲爱的  他们不让我们进去办
Honey, they're not going to let us have it inside.

499
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,880
我们就在这儿办
We're going to have it right here

500
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,950
在他们门前阶上  办成野餐会
on their front steps, picnic style.

501
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,760
需要我做什么
What do you need from me?

502
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,140
人力
I need your manpower.

503
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,650
是  先生  马上照办
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

504
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,380
注意  放下手头的工作  听好了
Okay, everybody, stop what you're doing, and listen up.

505
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,320

510
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,960
很好
Great.

511
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,560
弗兰西斯  食品怎样了
Francis, where are we with food?

512
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,410
我订到了热狗  比萨饼  还有南方黑人食品
I've got hotdogs, pizzas, and soul food coming,

513
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,720
可能还有别的

姑娘们  我是这么想的

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,320
你们不能在这儿办
You can't do this here.

538
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,580
佐伊  今晚八点  科茨沃斯酒店

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,130
防火规章我不太懂
You know, I'm no expert in fire code,

548
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,490
不过我想把客人关在里面
but I would imagine that locking your guests in

549
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,660
比让他们随意走动更违规
is a bigger violation than having them walk around us.

550
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,220
这是非法侵入私人领地

551

你想当面和他谈也行
You'd rather talk to him in person, that's great.

What do you want me to do?

566
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,060
我不能锁门  他们有警察撑腰
I can't lock the gates, and they've got the police on their side.

567
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,810
难以置信  稍等
Unbelievable. Hold on.

568
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,480

两百  我不确定能不能
200? I don't know if we can get that--

573
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,010
我不想听  搞定就是了
I don't want to hear it. Just get it done.

574
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,780
坦白说  我根本不在乎他们是不是老师
I don't give a fuck if they're teachers or not, frankly.

575
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,430
给我找两百个活人
Just get me 200 bodies.

576
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,260
打给卡车司机工会  也许他们会帮忙
You know, call the teamsters. Maybe they'll help us.

577
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,000
大不了给他们副眼镜
We'll give them glasses if we have to.

578
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,580
让他们打扮精神点
Tell the guys to look smart.

579

581
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,380
你知道吗  让他们去吧
You know what? Let them set it up.

582
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,880
这样反而对我们有利
It's actually better for us that way.

583
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,850
他们没法躲开我们
This way they can't hide from us.

584
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,840
你让我很难做
You've put me in a terrible situation.

585

590
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,200
从这儿到那儿  懂吗
This way, that way. Okay?

591
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,650
去死安德伍德

592
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,030
好吧  至少他拼对了
Well, at least he spelled it right.

593
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,680
一群教师突然聚集在
Teachers protesting the education reform

594
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:33,970

斯比奈拉让工会把我们拒之门外
Spinella got us shut out by the union,

606
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,910
所以我们就在酒店台阶上开派对
so we had to have the party out here on the steps.

607
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,010
我这就带你去吧台

你得靠边了
You're going to have to move over,

617
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,400
我要亲自招待这对了不起的夫妇

618
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,930
简直太棒了
This is fabulous.

619
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,850
只有克莱尔想得到
Only Claire could've thought of this.

620
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,220
你那儿有纯麦芽酒吗
I don't suppose you have anything single-malt back there.

621
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,420
弗兰克  看你当酒保真是物有所值
Frank, it's worth every penny to see you on keg duty.

622
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,640
那你说这杯酒是不是还能升值啊
Well, then don't you think this is worth just a few extra pennies?

623
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,970
我们该拿支票簿了  查尔斯
Oh, let's break out the checkbook, Charles.

624

你回复了吗
Did you RSVP?

625
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,210
我想这不重要
I assumed it didn't matter.

626
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,870
说得对
It doesn't.

627
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,340
很高兴你来了
I'm glad you're here.

628
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,380
我听了你的留言
When I heard your message.

629
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,000
我不该说那些话的  亚当

630
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,190
为什么
Why not?

631
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,840
也许我们该找时间聊聊
Maybe we should talk at some point.

632
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,750
把支票开大点  好吧
Make that check with a lot of zeroes, won't you?

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,410
我看到亚当来了

00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,640
-猜猜我弄到了什么  -什么

652
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,780
霍博恩夫妇又开了一张6万元支票
Another check from the Holburns for $60,000.

653
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,340
快  好好夸夸我吧
Come on, praise me like you should.

654
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,310
如果弗兰克・安德伍德和美国国会...
If Frank Underwood and the United States Congress--

655
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,970
我叫佐伊・巴恩斯  是头条网的
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes. I'm with Slugline.

656
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,040
践踏美国教师的权益
...dismantle the rights of the American teacher?

657
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,460
工会万岁  教师万岁
Unions, yes! Teachers, yes!

658
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,980
你们为什么在这里抗议
Hi. Why do you protest here?

659
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,370
国会要慎重对待这个问题
And Congress has to take this seriously.

660
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,420
我们为了教师而来
We're here for the teachers.

661
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,360
我们在这儿...
We're here--

662
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,050
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

663
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,840
我们的要求并不过分
We're not asking for the world,

664
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,570
国会得站出来  把事情解决
and Congress needs to step up and get this done.

665
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,820
失陪
Excuse me.

666
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,300
裙子看着很眼熟
That dress looks familiar.

667
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,360
去音乐会那天穿的那条
It's the one I wore to the symphony.

668
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,600
没错  我们彼此欣赏的那天
Oh, yes, mutual admiration society.

669
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,740
没错
That's right.

670
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,500
有什么消息给我吗
So what do you have for me?

671
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,180
什么意思
What do you mean?

672
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,160
你周围全是华盛顿名流
Well, you're surrounded by Washington's elite.

673
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,550
你没听到任何
Are you saying you've overheard nothing

674
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,390
会对你我有用的话吗
that could be useful to either of us?

675
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,730
我在报道抗议事件
I'm covering the protest.

676
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,940
全世界都在报道抗议事件
The rest of the world is covering the protest.

677
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,910
你也许没注意到
You may not have noticed,

678
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,690
但你是唯一参加派对的记者
but you're the only journalist inside the party.

679
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,770
我给你的东西很多了
I've been feeding you plenty.

680
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,670
消息该是互通的  巴恩斯小姐
Information is a two-way street, Miss Barnes.

681
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,880
-你好  -克莱尔  这是佐伊・巴恩斯

你在《先驱报》工作  对吗
You work for the Herald, right?

685
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:23,920
已经不在了
Not anymore.

686
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,410
我现在在头条网工作
I actually work at Slugline now.

687
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,610
我听说过那里
I've heard of it.

688
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,040
你读他们的报道  对吗  弗朗西斯
You read it, don't you, Francis?

689
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,360
忠实读者
Religiously.

690
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,320
你看来是位很有进取心的女孩
Well, you seem like a very ambitious young woman.

691
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,510
我很喜欢
I like that.

692
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,100
我在努力
Doing my best.

693
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,600
很高兴再次见到你
It's good to see you again.

694
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,840
玩得开心点
Please enjoy yourself.

695
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,110
会的  谢谢
I will. Thank you.

696
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,510
保重  巴恩斯小姐
Take care, Miss Barnes.

697
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,710
我什么都没有了  你害得我和孩子流落街头  你这个叛徒

698
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,340
你这么欺骗我  是为了什么  我想知道

699
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,200
罗素  吃屎去吧

700
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,880
真为你感到丢脸

701
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,570
你是好人  还是我想错了  你能帮我吗  苏珊・乔治

702
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,010
亲爱的苏珊  我知道你现在一定很受伤

703
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,990
我知道你认为这是我的错

704
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,660
你不是唯一这么想的

705
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,410
你没错  我是好人

706
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,470
至少我想做个好人

707
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,200
造船厂必须关闭的原因是....

708
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,740
我这次无法力争的原因是...

709
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,150
站在台阶上
...on the steps,

710
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,150
非常漂亮
and she looks gorgeous,

711
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,360
但其实她在想
but what really she's thinking,

712
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,110
我什么时候才能回家
when can I go the fuck home?

713
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,230
-我要走了  -这么早就走
- I'm off. - Already?

714
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,990
我想我的任务已经完成了
I've done my duty, I believe.

715
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,960
你了解我的
Oh, you know me.

716
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,220
总是第一个离开派对的人
Always have to be the first to leave a party.

717
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,290
已经筹集多少了
How much did you raise?

718
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,660
七十五万
$750,000.

719
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,490
其中八万来自你的照片
80 of that was your photographs.

720
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,430
太棒了
Fantastic.

721
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,960
再写张二十五万的支票  我们就有一百万了
Write a check for 250, we'll break a million.

722
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,290
想得美
Nice try.

723
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,870
感谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

724
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,430
以及你所做的一切
And everything that you did.

725
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,690
有空给我电话
Call me sometime.

726
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,780
我会的
I will.

727
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,240
净水慈善庆典
So what does a Clean Water gala

728
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,670
和教师工会有什么关系呢
have to do with teachers' unions?

729
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,650
超过50位国会议员就聚集在那里
Well, we have over 50 members of Congress gathered in one place.

730
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,620
但他们却都倡议
But the fact that these members of Congress are promoting

731
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,440
将钱投往国外
pouring money out of the country

732
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,960
而忽视本国的教师
while neglecting their teachers at home

733
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,480
这就是个问题
is precisely the problem.

734
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,580
但这是私人款项  不是公共税收  那么...
But this is private money, not public tax dollars, so...

735
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,700
我们不是在抗议活动本身
But we're not protesting the cause.

736
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,240
而是在抗议这些国会议员
We're protesting the Congressmen and women themselves.

737
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,990
这些抗议者都是教师吗
Are these even teachers picketing?

738
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,710
当然  一部分是
Well, sure, some of them.

739
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,810
还有一部分人是...
And some of them are people in--

740
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,860
不好意思
Excuse me.

741
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,960
弗兰克  你在
Frank. What are you--?

742
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,900
别拿食物  我们回头发食物
Don't take the food. We'll feed you later.

743
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,190
马蒂  你知道那句老话吧
Marty, you know that old saying.

744
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,400
世上最危险的事
The most dangerous spot in the world

745
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,740

841

你作为人选之一被提及了

860
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,240
其他人都说你不值得考虑
Everyone in that room wanted to cross you off the list.

861
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,180
我反对  我替你说话了
I said no. I stuck up for you.

862
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,570
我说"彼得・罗素这人有潜力"
I said, "Peter Russo, he's got potential."

863
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,980
"他年轻  有能力  必有发展"
"He's young. He's capable. He's going places."

864
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,390
我让他们继续考虑你
I made them keep you in contention.

865
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,240

868
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,150
还想反过来怪我
to try to shift the blame on me

869
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,810
而不是为你自己和你的行为负责
instead of taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions.

870
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,350
或许会议上他们是对的
Maybe they were right in that meeting.

871
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,230
也许你就是没用
Maybe you are worthless.

872

我是唯一相信你的人  彼得
I'm the only person who believes in you, Peter,

873
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,160
但或许我也不该信你

874
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,910
热水会舒张你的毛细管

你刚吃的阿司匹林会稀释你的血液
The aspirin you just took will make your blood thinner.

876
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,090
由你决定了  彼得
It's up to you, Peter.

877
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,900
如果你真决定以懦弱的方式解脱
Oh, and if you do decide to take the coward's way out,

878
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,280
沿血管割  不要横着割
cut along the tracks, not across them.

879
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,790
那是低级错误
That's a rookie mistake.

只有彼得能回答这问题
Only Peter can answer that question.

897
00:49:37,990 --> 00:50:19,690
本集开篇佐伊在考虑接受哪份职位时提到了多家新闻机构
CBS著名的《60分钟》是公共台唯一收视率排前五的新闻节目
所以佐伊说CBS找她作记者说明她很受欢迎
MSNBC  FOX NEWS和CNN是三家有线新闻台  只播出新闻
CNN名气大  资格老  但目前收视率最低
FOX NEWS的收视率往往能高于另外两家之和
MSNBC是后起之秀  现已将CNN远远甩开
FOX NEWS倾向共和党  MSNBC倾向民主党
CNN相对中立  略偏向民主党
而政治新闻网原来是一家华盛顿小报  但目前主要业务是网站
报道美国时政  近几年影响力越来愈大  美国政府和国会内部人员会看

这一集还提到了大选中所谓的"摇摆州"
美国50个州  有40个的支持倾向明确  每次大选投票结果可以预测
最关键有10个州每次选举结果不确定  也是大选时候选人的主攻方向
还有一个概念叫选区重划
之前说过众议员选举根据各州人数决定
美国每10年进行一次人口普查
然后根据新的人口数据重新分配各州众议员名额
各州的议会再开会重新划选区  通过划选区
有时候可以决定在这个选区哪个党的选民多
从而为该党派多选出议员

会议一段还提到sex offender sting
是指美国执法机构进行钓鱼执法
在网上论坛冒充未成年人约变态到特定地点约会
然后将其逮捕  而这些人即使服刑出狱
也要记录在案  不能在学校附近居住
