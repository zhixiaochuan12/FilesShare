1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,000
你知道我喜欢人哪一点吗
You know what I like about people?

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,840
会排队
They stack so well.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,580
我来收拾吧
Let me get this for you.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,790
-报纸还要吗  -不了
- Want the paper? - No.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,160
太多了
This is too much.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,940
差得远呢
It's not half enough.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,060
谢谢你为我开店
Thanks for opening up for me.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,500
你知道我随时欢迎你来
Any time, day or night. You know that.

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,380
这个城市的每个人都在精心地改头换面
In a town where everyone's so carefully reinventing themselves,

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,820
而弗莱迪的可贵之处
what I like about Freddy

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,540
就是他甚至不装作要改变
is that he doesn't even pretend to change.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,220
我要迟到了
Ooh. I'm late.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,980
我每周二都会和议长及多数党领袖一起
Every Tuesday I sit down with the speaker and the majority leader

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,510
商讨一周的事宜
to discuss the week's agenda.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,800
说是"商讨"可能不太准确
Well, discuss is probably the wrong word.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,730
他们谈话  而我安静地坐着
They talk while I sit quietly

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,260
想象他们淡腌过的脸在煎锅中炸
and imaging their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet.

18
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,860
瓦斯奎兹肯定吓得拉裤子了
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

19
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,290
别说她  沃克肯定也是
Shitting herself, when Walker is shitting himself

20
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,850
俩人的屎都摞一起了
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

21
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,440
鲍勃  我还想吃东西呢
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,840
有备用的法案吗
Do we have a backup on the docket?

23
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,910
你在处理吧  弗兰克
You're on that, right, Frank?

24
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,850
是的  我和我的团队...
Yeah, I'm working with my staff--

25
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,030
共和党会为此对我们穷追烂打
Republicans are gonna ram this up our ass.

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,220
换了我也会这么做
I would if I was them.

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,790
就算众议院勉强通过
Why, even if we squeak it through the house,

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,240
参议院也会百般刁难
watch them mangle it in the senate.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,260
国会投票前要就法案进行辩论  人数少的党派可找一个议员一直在台上讲
使法案不能进入投票  从而阻止一个法案通过

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,260
或阻挠议事
Or filibuster.

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,100
好吧  如果是那样...
Why, sure, if it looks anything like this...

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,040
我不明白沃克为什么
I don't know why Walker's

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,810
要对付一头横冲直撞的大象
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,760
真是疯了
It's madness.

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,830
各位议员  抱歉打扰了
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

36
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,000
我看见你们在这儿
but I saw you sitting over here--

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
雷米  两位  这是雷米・丹顿 
Remy. Gentlemen, this is Remy Danton.

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,130
雷米  这位是博奇议长和鲍勃...
Remy, this is Speaker Birch and Congress--

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,370
我知道  议长先生  议员先生
I'm well aware. Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

40
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,720
雷米刚成为格兰顿-希尔的合伙人
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,900
格兰顿-希尔可挺不错啊
Glendon Hill? Great team over there.

42
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,150
-恭喜  -谢谢
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

43
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,050
有多久没提拔合伙人了
When was the last time they added a partner?

44
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,060
挺久了
It's been a while.

45
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,050
他们一看就知道谁是好手
Well, they know a winner when they see one.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,460
雷米是我手下最好的新闻发言人
Remy was the best press secretary I ever had.

47
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,290
那你怎么放他走了
Why did you let him go?

48
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,320
我没有  他们把他挖走了
I didn't. They stole him away.

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
你们有哪些客户
What accounts do you have?

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,860
桑科工业是我的主要客户
San Corp Industries is my main one.

51
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,670
我负责他们公司
I run that account now.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,290
好了  那我就先走了
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

53
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,620
再次抱歉打扰了
Sorry again to interrupt.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,240
没关系
No problem.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,700
很高兴见到二位
Very nice to meet you both.

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,860
-真好  -说客越来越年轻了
- Nice. - Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,220
他挣得大概比我们加起来还多
He's probably making more than all of us combined.

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,310
先生们  这顿算我的
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

59
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,050
我去买单
I'm gonna track down that check.

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,340
格兰顿-希尔为桑科工业做说客
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,280
桑科的天然气做得有声有色
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,790
但我才不在乎天然气
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

63
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,630
我有67位副手
but I have 67 deputy whips,

64
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,680
他们都需要钱来赢得竞选
and they all need cash to win races.

65
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,820
桑科帮我买到了忠诚
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

66
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,460
也指望我以忠心相报
and in return they expect mine.

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,610
我知道这很下作
It's degrading, I know,

68
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,780
但利润如此丰厚
but when the tit's that big,

69
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,240
谁都想分一杯羹
everybody gets in line.

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,830
告诉他们一切尽在掌握之中
Tell them I'm on top of it.

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,000
这可打发不了我
I need more than that.

72
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,060
你知道我不会在这种事上犯错  雷米
You are well aware that I do not drop the ball on things like this, Remy.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,200
你的承诺  弗兰克  
Promises, Frank.

74
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,450
当选国务卿  阿根廷的近海开采合同
Secretary of State, Argentine and off shore drilling contracts--

75
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,510
我解决问题之后再谈
Talk to me when I've solved the problem.

76
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,320
现在别浪费我的时间
Don't waste my time when I'm working on solving the problem.

77
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,190
事关数十亿资金
When there's billions on the line,

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,440
你不能不回我电话
You can't not call me back.

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,540
我也不能做鸵鸟
I can't not show up.

80
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,260
好吧  多谢费心
Fine. Thank you for your diligence.

81
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,040
我们捐了上千万给民主党竞选委员会
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,180
以你命名的图书馆花了六百万
6 million to build that library of yours in your name.

83
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,010
我知道  
I know.

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,800
别逼得他们下回去资助你的对手
Don't make them throw money at your challenger next cycle.

85
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,610
你说得很清楚了
You've made your point.

86
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,080
是吗  希望如此
Have I? I hope so.

87
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,130
真是浪费啊
Such a waste of talent.

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,470
为了钱而放弃权力
He chose money over power--

89
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,840
这个城市里  几乎人人都犯了这个错
In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes.

90
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,640
大型现代房屋  缺乏个性  和当地建筑格格不入

91
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,640
金钱是萨拉索塔的巨无霸豪宅
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

92
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,030
保质期就只有十年
that starts falling apart after ten years.

93
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,900
权力是古老的石砌建筑
Power is the old stone building

94
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,980
能屹立数百年
that stands for centuries.

95
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,210
我要怎么尊重这都不懂的人
I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference.

96
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,050
这是什么
What am I looking at?

97
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,390
《威廉姆斯公报》
The Williams register.

98
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,700
-哪个  -那个大学
- Williams? - College.

99
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,810
78年9月
September '78.

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,310
让我看这个做什么
And why am I looking at it?

101
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,350
那篇社论
The editorial.

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,180
挺无聊的
Not that interesting.

103
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,440
迈克尔・科恩曾在威廉姆斯念书
Michael Kern went to Williams.

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,750
看报头
Check out the masthead.

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,030
还有这个
And then there's this.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,950
站不住
It's thin.

107
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,130
那家伙太讨喜了  屎都是香的
The guy's a unicorn. He pisses rainbows.

108
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,520
-你觉得这个能吸引眼球  -你可以
- You think we can get traction with this? - I think you could.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,990
琳达・瓦斯奎兹的电话
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

110
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,950
没想到她这么久才打来
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,400
才9点06分
It's only 6 past 9:00.

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,510
那她肯定三小时前就看过《先驱报》了
Which means she read the Herald 3 hours ago

113
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,350
然后被总统骂了两个半小时
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting reamed by the president.

114
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,700
跟她说我就来
Tell her I'm on my way.

115
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,290
你本该看着唐纳德的
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.

116
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,270
你向我保证
You assured me that you--

117
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,150
他推动这项议程有25年了
25 years he's been pushing this particular agenda.

118
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,000
他这就是护犊子
We got between the mother bear and her cub.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
只是个小挫折罢了
It's a setback. That's all.

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,890
这是我们就职首日
On our first day in office.

121
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,720
琳达  我为四位总统工作过
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,990
这么大的法案  挫折在所难免
Setbacks are a dime a dozen with a bill of this size.

123
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,060
弗兰克  你要是控制不住局面
Frank, if you can't control this--

124
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,560
我不喜欢被人死死盯着  琳达
I don't take well to being micromanaged, Linda.

125
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,600
你是要一边打理白宫  还干我的活儿吗
You want to do my job for me and run the White House?

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,310
祝你好运  我绝不阻拦
Good luck. I won't stand in your way.

127
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,140
好吧  弗兰克  这事你解决
Okay, Frank. Fine. This is yours now.

128
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,900
要是在一百天内  法案不能进行投票
If this thing can't make it to the floor in the first 100 days,

129
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,450
我就让你去跟总统解释
then I'll let you explain to the president

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,030
他怎么对美国人民失信了
why he lied to the American people.

131
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,150
我要回去干活了
I'm gonna get back to work.

132
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,060
请便
Please do.

133
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,020
这事真该放在周五
Well, we really should be doing this on a Friday

134
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,490
而不是周三
instead of a Wednesday.

135
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,970
要是周五的话
If we do it on a Friday,

136
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,350
-大家周末就能...  -好吧  那就周五
- people have the weekend-- - Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

137
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,960
文件都弄好了吗
Is all the paperwork ready?

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
部分老人比较棘手
Some of the more senior people are trickier.

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
需要离职金
There's severance.

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,450
应该没有什么法律问题吧
But we shouldn't run into any legal issues.

141
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,730
不会的  我们签的都是自由雇佣合同
No, no. We use at-will employment contracts across the board.

142
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,880
周五一来就着手这事
Well, get started first thing Friday.

143
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,610
午餐前搞定所有离职面谈
I want all of the exit interviews done by lunch.

144
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,510
克莱尔  我就是觉得这是个错误
Claire, I just can't help but think that this is a mistake.

145
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,340
我们已经谈过这个问题了  伊芙琳
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

146
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,610
我知道  但出于良心
I know, I know, but I just have to say it

147
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,380
我必须说出来
for the sake of my conscience.

148
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,620
我觉得你在摧毁
I think that you are dismantling

149
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,040
我们过去十年建立的一切
what we have built over the past ten years,

150
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,950
而我
and I--

151
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,740
我觉得你的处理方式
and I think the way you're handling this is...

152
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,300
很残忍
is cruel.

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
对我也不容易  伊芙琳
It's not easy, Evelyn.

154
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,200
但我必须这么做
But it's necessary.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,320
你一直让我实话实说
You have always asked me to be honest with you.

156
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,310
这是我们共事的基础
It's how we work together.

157
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,520
我有不同意见  就说出来
I disagree with something, I say it.

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,330
我对此完全不赞同
Well, I disagree 100%.

159
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,180
求你  克莱尔  别这样做
Please, Claire, don't do this.

160
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,860
我尊重你的意见  伊芙琳
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

161
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,090
我也很感谢你愿意告诉我
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

162
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,760
但我不会改变主意的
but I'm not going to change my mind.

163
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,760
周五
Friday, then.

164
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,690
你说了算
If that's what you want.

165
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,720
这是一项重大改革  全面改革
This is major reform, a complete overhaul.

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,550
一般都要几个月呢
That would usually take months.

167
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,270
我们只有几天  没有几个月
Well, we only have days, not months.

168
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,350
但想想这个过程  我们不能随便...
But think about the process. We can't just change--

169
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,220
我询问我的同事  你们的上司
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

170
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,000
教育界最聪明的人是谁
who are the smartest minds in education,

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,040
千挑万选  选中了你们
out of hundreds, we arrived at you--

172
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,980
这间房里的六位
the six of you in this room.

173
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,830
我知道任务艰巨
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

174
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,070
但我们现在有机会创造历史
but we have the opportunity to make history here.

175
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,790
我希望大家能齐心协力
And I want all of us to make it together.

176
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,030
祝好运  靠你们了
So good luck. We're counting on you.

177
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:44,680
第一页
Page 1.

178
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,720
着重号标出了
These bullet points reflect

179
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,650
法案的核心条款
the key planks at the center of our bill.

180
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,190
坐舒服了
Get comfy.

181
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,140
拿不出像样的初稿  就别想回家
This is your home until we have a presentable first draft.

182
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,130
唐纳德  今早真够呛
Donald, what a morning.

183
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,100
我不知道他们怎么搞到的
I have no idea how they got this.

184
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,810
我明确告诉手下销毁一切
I specifically told my staff to destroy everything.

185
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,630
-我真不知...  -那不是重点
- I can't imagine- - It doesn't matter how it happened.

186
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,830
过去的没法改变  只能随机应变
We can't make it unhappen, so we have to adapt.

187
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,760
他们不知道这只是初稿吗
Don't they realize that this is a first draft?

188
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,950
其实就看你是站在什么角度了
All we have here really is a perception problem.

189
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,590
第一印象只有一次  唐纳德
We don't get a second chance at a first impression, Donald.

190
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,330
你也知道  我当然站在你这边
You know that. Now, look, I'm on your side,

191
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,580
但琳达很生气
but Linda is furious.

192
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,490
她是什么意思
What's she saying?

193
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,720
他们要找人怪罪
They want to point fingers.

194
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,540
我吗
At me?

195
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,300
我跟她说不能这样
I told her we cannot do that.

196
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,370
你对立法及其重要
I mean, you are vital to this process.

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,680
唐纳德  我受够他们了
I'm up to here with them, Donald--

198
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,920
谎话连篇  落井下石
for lying, for turning their back on you.

199
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,120
我要说  去你的
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

200
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,780
这个栽我认了
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

201
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,420
就气死他们
just to piss them off.

202
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,530
给我接CNN的约翰・金
Give me John King at CNN.

203
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,500
等等  弗兰克  这不是你的错
Wait, Frank. This is not your fault.

204
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,450
不  我们得保护你的声誉
No, we have to protect your reputation.

205
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,590
但是你得保证法案通过投票
But you're the man that needs to get the bill through the house.

206
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,820
我会...等等  我会交待我的副手
I will-- hang on. I will assign it to one of my deputies,

207
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,240
私下搞定  教你怎么走那个过场
quietly manage it, and I'll help guide you through the process.

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,690
我不喜欢这样
I am not comfortable with this.

209
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,470
那你说我们怎么办
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

210
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,930
烈士最渴求的
What a martyr craves more than anything

211
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,190
就是壮烈牺牲
is a sword to fall on,

212
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,190
所以  你磨好兵刃
so you sharpen the blade,

213
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,860
调整好角度
hold it at just the right angle,

214
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,730
默数三  二  一
and then 3, 2, 1--

215
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,710
我来
It should be me.

216
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,180
这是我的法案
It was my bill.

217
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,870
不行  唐纳德
No. Impossible. Donald,

218
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,790
教育事业是你毕生的心血
education has been your life's work.

219
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,960
实际上  我的心根本不在这儿
The truth is my heart is not in this fight.

220
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,600
你也知道  我不会精明算计
You know me. I'm not a wheeler dealer.

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,990
我全心投入制定政策
I can put my mind to policy,

222
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,670
但没什么政治手腕
but I'm no good at this brand of politics.

223
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,970
那要找谁替你呢
Well, if not you, then who?

224
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,010
应该你来  弗兰克
It should be you, Frank.

225
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,520
你令人敬畏  受人尊重
You're formidable. People respect you.

226
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,470
他们会听你的领导  让我
They will follow your lead. Let me--

227
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,420
让我置身事外吧
let me be on the sidelines for this.

228
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,350
要我考虑接受
Well, I could only consider that as an option

229
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,280
你得保证给我提建议
if I knew that I could still come to you for counsel.

230
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,840
当然  听候差遣
Of course. Whatever you need.

231
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,990
我内心多少庆幸泄密了
Part of me is glad this got leaked.

232
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,810
如果没这事最好
Well, it would have been better if it hadn't,

233
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,290
但至少人们知道了我的立场
but at least people know where I stand.

234
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,460
谢谢你  唐纳德
Thank you, Donald.

235
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,060
我的荣幸  弗兰克
Happy to do it, Frank.

236
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,930
他不知道我们找了六个孩子在隔壁
He has no idea we've got six kids in the next room

237
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,600
紧锣密鼓地拟定新草案
already working on a new draft.

238
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,270
斯坦普  何必要说出来让他伤心呢
Stamper! But why dampen his mood by telling him?

239
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,660
我们刚刚给了他份大礼
We just gave him a great gift--

240
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,580
让他能完成使命
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

241
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,300
为布莱斯写一份声明
Write up a statement for Blythe--

242
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:42,230
有事要谈  今晚见

243
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,150
退位让贤  提出新想法
stepping aside, fresh ideas,

244
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,980
等等  等等  给他点面子
et cetera, et cetera, and make it dignified.

245
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,880
他是个好人
He's a good man.

246
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,470
把威廉姆斯社论拿来
Oh. And bring me that Williams editorial.

247
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,170
收件人  佐伊・巴恩斯

248
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,920
经过慎重考虑和团队商议
After careful thought and discussion with my staff,

249
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,520
我将不再负责教育改革法案
I am relinquishing my management of the education reform act.

250
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,450
我仍然希望能略尽绵力
I hope to remain a part of the process,

251
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,370
但我将不再...
but I won't be working--

252
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,850
你为什么要泄露草案
Why did you leak the draft?

253
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,190
我不清楚怎么会泄露
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

254
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,260
但是它代表了
but, uh, it does represent--

255
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,890
是从你办公室泄露出去的  对吗
It came from your office, though, correct?

256
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,390
是我们起草的  但我不
Uh, we wrote it, but I don't--

257
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,940
现在是谁负责这个法案
Who'll be managing the bill now?

258
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,680
弗兰克・安德伍德
Frank Underwood.

259
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,770
是你的决定
Was that your choice,

260
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,680
还是政府
or did the administration--

261
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,130
教室危机  唐纳德・布莱斯  泄露教育草案执笔人

262
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,220
弗兰克能力出众
I feel very confident

263
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,230
由他接手法案  我非常放心
placing the bill in Frank's capable hands.

264
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,680
巴恩斯小姐
Ms. Barnes.

265
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,250
深喉为1972年水门事件中内线的假名

266
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,250
你真够深喉
How very deep throat of you.

267
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,790
我没法帮你撵走一个总统
Well, I can't help you dispatch a president.

268
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,120
参议员怎么样
How about a senator?

269
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,730
戴维营协议:上世纪八十年代埃以签署的重要协议

270
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,730
关于戴维营协议的社论
The editorial on the Camp David Accords.

271
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,690
本报认为
"It is the opinion of this newspaper

272
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,720
卡特总统应要求以色列
that President Carter demand Israel

273
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,220
撤出约旦河西岸
withdraw all its citizens

274
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,030
及加沙地带的所有以色列公民
from the Gaza Strip and West Bank."

275
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,940
以色列自1967年以来就非法占据了该地区
"Which it has illegally occupied since 1967."

276
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,550
非法占据
Illegally occupied.

277
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,420
这话肯定能引起轰动  你说呢
That's quite an incendiary quote, don't you think?

278
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,750
毕竟这届政府表示
For an administration that says

279
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,400
中东是外交政策的重中之重
that the Middle East is its top foreign policy priority.

280
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,420
迈克尔・科恩
Michael Kern?

281
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,050
社论是他亲自执笔的吗
Did he personally write the editorial?

282
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,350
他是编辑
He was the editor.

283
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,880
但是他执笔的吗
But did he write it himself?

284
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,950
那这就不算新闻
Then there's no story.

285
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,160
我认为这是一个值得指出的问题
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.

286
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,890
如果他否认与这篇文章有关呢
And if he denies involvement?

287
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,620
那是必然  随他去
He will. Let him.

288
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,320
这个人正在等着正式上任国务卿
This is a man trying to be confirmed as Secretary of State.

289
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,020
他的一切都是新闻
Everything is a story.

290
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,590
可是没有直接关联
There's no direct link.

291
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,640
汉默施密特不会允许见报的
I can't get this past Hammerchmidt.

292
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,180
记住你拒绝我的这一刻
Remember this moment when you resisted me,

293
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,080
记住你亲口说  "那这就不算新闻"
when you said the words "Then there is no story."

294
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,680
好好睡一觉吧  巴恩斯小姐
Get a good night's sleep, Ms. Barnes.

295
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,370
明天还有你忙的
You have a big day tomorrow.

296
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,740
弗兰西斯
Francis?

297
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,510
这是什么
What is this?

298
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,640
你觉得像什么
What does it look like?

299
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,200
但地下室是我的
But the basement is mine.

300
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,690
我知道  这不是给我的
I know. It's not for me.

301
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,010
那是给谁的
So who's it for?

302
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,980
给你的
For you.

303
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,190
国会大厦有健身房
There's a gym in the Capitol.

304
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,400
你从来不去
Which you never use.

305
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,790
国事已经够我忙的了
Because I'm a tad busy running the country.

306
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,040
在家不用忙国事  你还要怎么说
But not at home, so now you have no excuse.

307
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
把它给我拿出去
I want it out.

308
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
试试看嘛
Give it a try first.

309
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,320
你是在委婉地表示我身材走样了吗
Is this your subtle way of saying that I'm out of shape?

310
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,030
不  我不过是认为
No, it's my way of suggesting

311
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,200
你的身材可以再好一点
you could be in better shape.

312
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,970
这句话既以退为进
That sounds both passive-aggressive

313
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,170
又居高临下
and condescending.

314
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,750
我这是以诚为进
Just plain aggressive and true.

315
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,610
别等我
Don't wait up for me.

316
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,010
你这个时间去跑步吗
Are you going running now?

317
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,510
对  因为我早上没跑成
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

318
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,520
有个晨会
I had an early meeting.

319
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,180
外面那么冷  用这个怪物锻炼吧
Use the monstrosity. It's freezing out.

320
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
你先来
You break it in.

321
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,380
看上去像中世纪文物  不是吗
It looks positively medieval, doesn't it?

322
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,470
把我仅有的圣殿变成健身地牢
And to turn my only sanctuary into a fitness dungeon.

323
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,530
我绝不容忍
I won't have it.

324
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,950
国务卿提名人迈克尔・科恩首肯反以社论

325
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,910
站不住脚
It's a stretch.

326
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,320
我们没有误导读者
We're not misleading anyone.

327
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,020
-他的确是编辑  -他们有回应吗
- He was the editor. - Did you call for a comment?

328
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
我打了三次电话
I tried three times.

329
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,670
新闻发言人说他会回电
The press secretary said he'd get back to me.

330
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,000
-但他没回  -背景调查呢
- He didn't. - What about research?

331
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,090
有任何附和这篇社论的材料吗
You couldn't find anything to echo the editorial?

332
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,730
言论  评论文章
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

333
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,240
你不觉得如果有的话
Don't you think if something like that existed,

334
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,940
早会有人报道了吗
someone would have printed it by now?

335
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,970
只有我们知道  卢卡斯
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

336
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,220
我觉得这算不上是新闻
I don't think there's a story here.

337
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,300
我没说这是新闻
I'm not saying there's a story.

338
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,980
我不过认为这是个应该提出的问题
All I'm saying is that there's a question that needs to be answered.

339
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,990
这可是国务卿提名人
This is a nominee for Secretary of State.

340
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,480
而我们手上有份巴以社论
We have an editorial on Palestine and Israel.

341
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,250
却不是他写的
Which he didn't write.

342
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,770
我们无法确认这点
Which we don't know he didn't write.

343
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,040
正是
Exactly.

344
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,340
不非得见报啊
We don't have to print it.

345
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,490
我可以扫描一份  发在网上
I could just scan the thing, stick it on a site,

346
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,250
然后推特网址
and tweet the link.

347
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,790
但那样的话  别家报纸
But if I did that, some other paper might--

348
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,450
行了  别那么贱
Whoa, whoa. Don't be a bitch.

349
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,060
我去和汤姆说
I'll talk to Tom.

350
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,570
我就是这个意思
That's all I was asking.

351
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,740
我们不能允许...
We simply can't afford to allow the--

352
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,380
迈克尔・科恩  国务卿提名人

353
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,690
我们找到一个绝佳人选
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

354
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,500
他是一个窝在房车里的自由意志主义瘾君子
He's a libertarian drug fiend marinating in a mobile home.

355
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,950
我不赞成里根总统的很多主张
I didn't agree with President Reagan on many things,

356
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,320
但滴入式经济的理念确实有可取之处
but there was some merit to the notion of trickle-down economics,

357
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,480
并且我认为滴入式外交也益处良多
and I feel there is much merit to the idea of trickle-down diplomacy.

358
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,150
如果我们能解决...
If we can solve...

359
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,920
那是我说的
Those are my lines.

360
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,440
一定是瓦斯奎兹告诉他的
Vasquez must have given them to him.

361
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,360
以色列和巴勒斯坦之间的僵局
...stalemate between Israel and Palestine,

362
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,730
这项成功将"滴入"
that success will trickle down

363
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,730
"滴入式外交"

364
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,330
其他穆斯林  犹太和基督教国家之间的
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas between Muslims,

365
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,470
外交困境中
Jews, Christians--

366
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,330
正好你提到了以色列和巴勒斯坦
I'm glad you brought up Israel and Palestine

367
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,590
我们直播前不久
because just before we came on the air,

368
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,830
我收到一篇明天将刊登在
I received an advance copy of an article

369
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,490
《华盛顿先驱报》头版的报道样本
that's going to be in tomorrow's washington Herald's front page

370
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,360
作者是佐伊・巴恩斯
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

371
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,700
其中她引用了一篇
and in it she quotes

372
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,480
刊登在《威廉姆斯公报》上的一篇社论
an editorial that ran in the Williams College register

373
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,390
时间为1978年九月  你时任公报总编
when you were editor back in September 1978,

374
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,110
其中称在加沙地带
which called the Israeli presence

375
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,000
和约旦河西岸居住的以色列人
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, quote,

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,910
为"非法占据"
an illegal occupation.

377
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,210
-我能看下吗  -当然
- Can I see that?  - Sure.

378
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,490
"非法占据"是出自你手吗
Did you write those words, "Illegal occupation"?

379
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,960
不  我完全不记得这事
No. I have no memory of this.

380
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,210
你可是报纸的总编
But you were the editor of the paper.

381
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,160
没错  但是
Yes, but--

382
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,280
那没经你首肯  它无法见报
So it couldn't have gone out without your approval.

383
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,350
对  那是当然  但是我的下属
No, of course not, but my staff--

384
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,270
通常是其他人来写...
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

385
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,220
之后我们还投票  如果
the, uh-- and then we'd vote, and if--

386
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,810
你投赞成票了吗
Did you vote for it?

387
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,260
说真的  乔治  我记不得了
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

388
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,110
这都35年了
It was 35 years ago.

389
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,140
这么说你不确定
So you're not sure

390
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,850
自己当时是否赞成这些言论
whether or not you supported these words--

391
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,460
我非常确信地告诉你
I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt

392
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,000
我没写过那些话
I did not write these words.

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,750
但当时你是那样想的吗
But were they in line with your thinking at the time?

394
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,650
这太荒谬了
This is ludicrous.

395
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,150
我知道这事有年头了  这我理解
I know it was a long time ago, I understand that.

396
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,150
这个就足够了  他的笑
That's all we need-- him laughing.

397
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,420
南茜  帮我接反诽谤联盟的丹尼斯・门德尔
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

398
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,980
中东地区对我国利益至关重要
The Middle East is a vital American interest.

399
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,110
你对中东地区的看法很重要
What you think about the Middle East is relevant.

400
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,800
你可以察看我的表决记录
You can look at my voting record.

401
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,320
每一票都站在以色列的立场上
Every single vote has been in defense of Israel--

402
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,950
那你什么时候改变想法的
So when did your views change?

403
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,640
我的意思就是
What I'm saying to you is my--

404
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,370
现在要紧的  乔治
What's important now, George,

405
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,660
是我代表
is how I have voted

406
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,820
科罗拉多州时投的表决票
while I have represented the great state of Colorado--

407
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,930
这我知道
I understand that's your position,

408
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,730
但很多看到这篇报道的人会认为
but a lot of other people are going to look at it and think

409
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,460
你当时的想法也是很重要的
what you thought then is relevant as well.

410
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,140
那我问你
Well, let me ask you this.

411
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,630
你大学之后从未改变过想法吗
Have you ever changed your views since college?

412
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,970
有  但我又没有被提名为国务卿
Certainly, but I'm not the nominee for Secretary of State.

413
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
就算我曾经有
Uh, even if I did have--

414
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,040
真是绝了
It's golden.

415
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,500
我也早就不再...
This has not been my views--

416
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,370
正中靶心
It's a bull's eye.

417
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,460
你刚进来时说什么来着
What were you saying when you came in?

418
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,960
是这样的  我找到一个人
So, ahem, I found a guy

419
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,660
是科恩任总编时学院的编辑人员
who was on the college editorial staff when Kern was there.

420
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
这个瘾君子
This burnout,

421
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,820
仍然伯克郡的一个
still pumping mimeographed manifestos

422
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,420
拖车公园里油印自由宣言
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

423
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,330
-你可不能去见他  -不不
- You're not planning on talking to him. - No. No.

424
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,840
让彼得・罗素去
Peter Russo.

425
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,220
很好
Good.

426
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,650
一对儿瘾君子  正合适
Sounds like a perfect match.

427
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,550
丹尼斯
Dennis.

428
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,950
你在看史蒂法诺普洛的节目吗
Any chance you're watching Stephanopoulos?

429
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,010
你努力提高辛勤的宾州人民的
You look sexy when you're improving the lives

430
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,710
生活水平的样子真性感
of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

431
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
是因为我在工作
Is it the improving lives,

432
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,520
还是因为这条迷人的运动裤
or is it these fetching sweat pants?

433
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,130
把电脑拿开
Why don't you move that computer out of the way?

434
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,350
让我鉴定一下
Let me see what that looks like.

435
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,370
还是用电脑挡着好
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

436
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,440
一边去
Fuck off.

437
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,030
你对我不够关注
You're not paying enough attention to me.

438
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,740
在办公室  我整天都在关注你
I pay attention to you all day at the office.

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,910
我以前好像
Hey, you know, I don't think

440
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,660
从没见过你刷牙
I've ever seen you brush your teeth before.

441
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,320
-肯定见过  -应该没有
- Sure you have. - No, I don't think so.

442
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,480
我知道你肯定刷牙
I mean I know that you do brush,

443
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,760
但好像从没亲眼见过
but I don't think I've ever actually witnessed it before.

444
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,650
这次让你欣赏个够
Well, here it is in all its glory.

445
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,190
那是我的牙刷吗
Is that my toothbrush?

446
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,330
不知道  是吗
I don't know. Is it?

447
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,490
是的
Yes, it is.

448
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,420
-是你留下的  -彼得  真恶心
- You left it here. - Peter, gross.

449
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,560
得了吧
Oh, come on.

450
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,050
我们都交换过多少体液了

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,870
他还称以色列"非法"
And he calls Israel illegal.

521
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,320
这是反犹思想  而且大错特错
Well, he's an anti-semite, and he is wrong.

522
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,540
如果任命这样的人
We would have grave, grave concerns

523
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,870
来做国务卿  我们将十分忧虑
about appointing such a man our next Secretary of State.

524
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,960
得来全不费工夫

你要么是在撒谎  那就滚蛋

532
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,320
要么没在撒谎  那就更得滚蛋
or you're telling the truth, and you can absolutely fuck off.

533

去把衣服穿上
Put some clothes on.

-不加  -很好
- Uh, no ice. - Good.

It's okay. It's okay.

545
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,160
你替我保密  我也替你保密
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

546
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,060
你说你是国会议员
A congressman, you say?

547
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,220
现在我只是你的酒伴
Right now, I'm just a drinking companion.

548
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,820
好吧  酒伴
Well, all right, companion.

549
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,190
来一杯吧
Have yourself a drink.

550

这是一万美金
$10,000.

552
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,420
能买到什么服务
What will that get me?

553
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,530
我挺重口的
I mean, I'm kinky,

554
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,860
但恐怕我不是你想找的人
but I don't know if I'm the girl you're looking for.

555
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,060
你就是我要找的人
You're definitely the girl that I'm looking for.

556
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,530
请原谅
Excuse me.

557
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,280
我只想用这笔钱买你闭嘴
All I want for that money is your silence.

558
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,730
我什么
My what?

559
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,430
那天晚上跟你在一起的男人
The guy you were with the other night,

560
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,460
那个被逮捕的  你知道他是谁吗
the one who was arrested, do you know who he was?

561
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,980
你是说那位议员
You mean the congressman?

562
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,440
没有什么议员  也没有逮捕这回事
There was no congressman. There was no arrest.

563
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,660
没有那回事
None of that exists.

564
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,110
有的只是
All that exists

565
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,920
你面前的这沓钱
is the money sitting right there in front of you.

566
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,490
明白了吗
Do you understand?

567
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:51,810
明白了
Yeah.

568
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,360
很好
Good.

569
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,580
张嘴
Open your mouth.

570
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,110
这是我个人的消费
Last little bit's for me.

571
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,960
你在斥责我
You're scolding me.

572
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,390
有吗
Am I?

573
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,900
无声地斥责
You are, silently.

574
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,870
-是因为那台划船机吗  -你说呢
- Is it the rowing machine? - You tell me.

575
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,640
那就是了
It's the rowing machine.

576
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,290
-你都没用  -你怎么知道
- You haven't used it. - How do you know I haven't?

577
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,500
弗兰西斯
Francis.

578
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,870
你知道我不喜欢受人摆布
You know I don't like to be managed.

579
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,850
我没想摆布你
I'm not trying to manage you.

580
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,330
我只是不想守寡25年
I just don't want to outlive you by 25 years.

581
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,770
我每天在国会大厦肯定能走上三英里
I must walk three miles a day around that Capitol.

582
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,260
我经常步行
I'm constantly on my feet.

583
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,880
你知道脑力劳动有多消耗能量吗
And do you know how many calories the brain burns?

584
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,330
我不担心你的大脑
I'm not worried about your brain.

585
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,610
我担心的是你的心脏
It's your heart we're talking about.

586
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,510
好好用那台划船机
Use the machine.

587
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,080
她是对的
She's right.

588
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,430
我应该照顾好自己
I should take better care of myself.

589
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,970
但这是原则问题
But it's the principle.

590
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,550
我绝不受人
I won't be a slave to

591
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,970
或者免费电话能订购的东西摆布
anybody or anything you can order with a toll-free number.

592
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,170
我们这里实行共产主义
We share the wealth in this republic.

593
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,680
不是所有编辑人员都有参与吗
I thought the whole editorial team pitched in.

594
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,300
有时候如此  不过那次没有
Sometimes. Not that time, though.

595
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,790
但他肯定也写了一部分吧
But he must have written some of it?

596
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,120
不  全篇都是我写的
No. That was all me.

597
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,480
如果让人们认为是他写的呢
What if people thought he wrote it?

598
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,660
去他的  他是个骗子
Oh, fuck that. He's a fraud.

599
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,510
不  他还不如骗子呢  他就是个跳梁小丑
Nah, he's worse than a fraud. He's a fucking farce.

600
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,710
我跟你说
I'll tell you something.

601
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,910
他一度比我还疯狂
He used to be even more of a maniac than I am.

602
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,600
-是说吸毒吗  -不  是在政治上
- Chemicals? - No. Politics.

603
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,980
我们曾经彻夜长谈
Oh, we had some nights, man. Long conversations,

604
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,790
讨论危险的想法
dangerous fucking notions.

605
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,610
-比如呢  -什么都有  石油输出国组织
- Like what? - You name it-- OPEC,

606
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,580
皮诺切特  该死的食品券法案
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

607
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,580
皮诺切特: 1973年至1990年为智利军事独裁首脑
食品券法案: 1964年的一项法案  针对失业者和贫民发放粮票

608
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,550
后来祖国唱起了求偶之歌
Then the motherland sang her mating call.

609
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,350
哦  你能[美国国歌的首句歌词]
O say can you--

610
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,770
接着他就跑去布林茅尔为考律师埋头苦学
Next thing, he's cramming for the bar at Bryn Mawr

611
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,460
布林茅尔学院位于美国宾州  是一所百年名校

612
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,380
还别上了国旗胸针
and snapping on a flag pin.

613
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,780
布林茅尔有法学院吗
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

614
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,570
反正他自此正式加入了牵线木偶的队列
My point is, he started goose-stepping in the marionette parade.

615
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,520
左派右派  红营蓝营  民主共和
Left, right; red, blue; Democrat, Republican.

616
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,620
我们都被同一根线吊着
We're all dangling from the same strings.

617
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,530
《潘趣与朱迪》: 英国传统木偶戏

618
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,530
给这该死的木偶戏致命一击吧
Take a sledgehammer to the whole fucking Punch and Judy show.

619
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,930
这才是该做的
That's what's required.

620
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,930
我以为你很爱国呢
Thought you were a patriot.

621
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,590
没错  为数不多的爱国者
Fuck, yeah. One of the few.

622
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,560
-那你对公职人员有什么不满  -公职
- So what's wrong with public service? - Public service?

623
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,220
拜托  你得搞清楚你老大是谁
Come on. You gotta get a grip on who your masters are.

624
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,110
国际货币基金组织  世界银行
The I.M.F., the World Bank,

625
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,310
洛克菲勒三边委员会
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

626
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,770
你为他们的爪牙提供资金
You bankroll their fucking death squads.

627
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,290
包括联邦应急管理局  烟酒军火管理局
It's called FEMA; it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms;

628
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,920
北约  还有边境管制
NATO; Border Control.

629
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,680
你以为卡特里娜飓风那次是办事不利吗
You think Katrina was incompetence?

630
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,850
那是精心策划的渎职
That was highly orchestrated negligence.

631
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,310
韦科事件: 1993年2月28日美国联邦执法人员围剿大卫邪教总部  造成惨案

632
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,310
看看韦科事件  国际特赦组织
Look at Waco, Amnesty International,

633
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,450
美国公民自由联盟
the ACLU.

634
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,480
全是障眼法  他们的手上沾满鲜血
Smokescreens-- all of them. Blood on their hands.

635
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,230
正因为如此啊
Well, exactly.

636
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,280
你想让我对公众撒谎
You want me to lie to the people.

637
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,430
我想让你替人民赶走一个伪君子
I want you to spare the people another hypocrite.

638
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,540
对你有什么好处
What's in it for you?

639
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,080
劝善惩恶
Poetic justice.

640
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,050
得了吧  你也是他们的一员
Oh, come on. You're one of them.

641
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,920
政府的探子能卷出这样的大麻吗
Can a corporate sellout roll a joint like this?

642
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,640
如果我同意帮你忙
If I wanted to do this thing,

643
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,330
我究竟该怎么做
how might I go about that, precisely?

644
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,350
还顺利吗
How did it go?

645
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,700
不少人都流了眼泪
There were a few tears here and there

646
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,230
还有些怒气
and some anger,

647
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,120
但都在预料之中
but nothing unexpected.

648
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,930
你今天也得离开公司  伊芙琳  
I'm going to need you to leave us today, too, Evelyn.

649
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,960
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

650
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,440
但我的决策方向容不得一丝质疑
I just can't have any doubt about the direction I'm taking.

651
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,020
你刚让我解雇了18名员工
You just had me fire 18 people.

652
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,750
我知道
I know.

653
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,550
我就坐在这个房间  和他们面对面
I sat across from them in this room,

654
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,420
我不得不告诉他们每个人
and I had to tell each and every one of--

655
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,230
我知道
I know.

没人会雇我这把年纪的员工

658
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,480
你要什么样的推荐信我都...
I will write you any kind of recommenda--

659
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,380
去应聘什么  收银员吗 
To do what, bag groceries?

660
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,450
我该怎么告诉我女儿
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?

661
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,660
我很抱歉  伊芙琳  真心抱歉
I'm sorry, Evelyn. I truly am.

662
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,370
不  你没有  你压根不在乎
No, you're not. You don't give a fuck.

663

18个人啊  克莱尔
Eighteen people, Claire.

664
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,590
算上我的话  是19个
Nineteen, if you count me.

665
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:19,880
我要去
I have to...

666

我要打电话给我女儿了

00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,120
今天离开我们的很多人
Many of those who left us today

671
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,470
帮我一手创建了净水计划
helped build the CWI from the ground up,

672
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,930
我对他们心怀感激
and I'm grateful to them.

673
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,560
但是我们要更上一层楼了
But it is time for us to evolve,

674
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,250
为达成这一目标
and to accomplish this,

675
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,470
我们必须做出艰难的抉择
we had to make hard choices

676
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,430
引进新人才

国内和城市新闻没问题

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,330
如有必要  可以腾一点地方给政治新闻
We've got space for political if we need it.

682
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,780
简宁  有迈克尔・科恩的新消息吗
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

683
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
白宫在回避
The White House is dodging.

684
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,350
你采访不到任何人吗
You can't get anyone on record?

685
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,420
不只是我
Not just me.

686
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,100
他们在通气会上只字不提
They're shutting all of us down in the briefings.

687
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,900
所有人牙关紧闭  背景资料都不肯透露
No one is giving an inch, even on background.

688
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,320
与此同时  我正在策划
In the meantime, I'm working on a feature

689
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,450
关于政府外交政策议程的特辑
about the administration's foreign policy agenda.

690
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,420
它是如何从大选伊始慢慢改变
How it shifted from the start of the campaign,

691
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,060
-增加国防部开支  -说吧  佐伊
- increased D.O.D. spending, and-- - We see you, Zoe.

692
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,420
我能证明《公报》社论是科恩写的
I can link Kern directly to the Williams editorial.

693
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,940
-什么  -有个叫罗伊・科佩尼科的人
- What? - I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak

694
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,700
他是科恩任主编时的一名编辑人员
who was on the editorial staff when Kern was there.

695
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,430
玩推特的娘们  搞什么鬼  
Hey, Twitter twat, W.T.F.?

696
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:23,040
-等等  罗伊什么  -科佩尼科
- Wait, wait, wait. Roy what? - Kapeniak.

697
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,390
科恩的同班同学
A classmate of Kern's.

698
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,640
我有他的公开声明
I have him on record saying

699
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,800
称那篇社论出自科恩笔下
Kern wrote every word of the editorial.

700
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,460
进我办公室谈
Let's move this into my office.

701
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,830
佐伊  卢卡斯
Zoe, Lucas.

702
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,600
简宁
Janine.

703
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,860
请允许我  请允许我  最后一次
Let me-- let me, once and for all,

704
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,520
郑重声明
say this definitively:

705
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,710
社论不是我写的
I didn't author that editorial.

706
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,170
一句话  一个词  一个逗号  一个句点都不是
Not a single sentence, word, comma, or period.

707
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,330
如果我没记错  作者正是科佩尼科先生
If memory serves me, it was Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

708
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,410
科恩否认撰写社论  同班同学称科恩是反以社论作者

709
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,890
我无法理解他为什么声称是我写的
Why on earth he's trying to claim that I did is beyond me.

710
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,010
请允许我进一步阐明
Let me further say that I'm

711
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,340
我坚定地支持以色列国
a strong supporter of the State of Israel.

712
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,550
作为地区最稳定的国家
As the most stable country in the region

713
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,710
以及我们最可靠的同盟
and our strongest ally

714
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,520
弗兰克・安德伍德找凯茜
It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.

715
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,760
在任何的和平进程之中
...in any peace process,

716
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,060
如果没有以色列的稳定
because without the stability of Israel,

717
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,230
就不会有巴勒斯坦
there can be no Palestine.

718
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,930
快看CNN
CNN right now.

719
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,930
没有以色列就没有巴基斯坦
"Without Israel there can be no Palestine"?

720
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,630
-我在看了  -我想提醒科恩参议员
- I've got it on. - I would remind Senator Kern

721
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,990
巴勒斯坦历史可比以色列久远
that there was a Palestine long before there was an Israel.

722
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
他的言论不仅无知  还种族歧视
His comments are not only ignorant, they are racist.

723
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,790
准备好  凯茜  事态要开始急剧变化了
Get ready, Cathy. Things are about to move very quickly.

724
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,550
-他对于中东的理解  -好的
- ...his understanding of the Middle East-- - Okay.

725
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,630
-如此脱离现实  -我准备好了
- ...is so out of sync with reality... - I'm ready.

726
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,670
-彼得  站住  -等下
- Peter? No. Stop. - Uh, not now.

727
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,490
喂  你去哪了
Hey. Hey, where have you been?

728
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,020
天啊  你嗑药了
Oh, God, you're fucking high.

729
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,050
-没  我  -你绝对磕了  看你眼睛
- No. I-- - Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.

730
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,060
拜托了  别烦我
Oh, please, just lay off.

731
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,570
你保证过不会再这样了
You promised me it wouldn't be like this.

732
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,610
把今天剩下的事都取消掉
Cancel whatever I have for the rest of the day.

733
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,890
创新及行动奖  荣誉奖

734
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,890
科恩出局了
Kern is out.

735
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,780
他被踢出去了
They're tossing him?

736
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,370
严格地讲  是他退出  不过  没错
Technically, he'd withdraw himself, but yes.

737
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,890
我可以说"据白宫知情人士透露"吗
Can I say "A source close to the White House"?

738
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,540
不  这事你不要抢着报道
No. You let this story play out on its own time.

739
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,830
明早他们就会宣布
They'll announce in the morning.

740
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,050
不好意思  如果不是这篇  是什么新闻
I'm sorry. If not that, what story are we talking about?

741
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,910
凯瑟琳・杜兰特
Catherine Durant.

742
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,440
等科恩退出之后  你马上就说她会顶上来
As soon as Kern withdraws, you say she'll be the replacement.

743
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,280
-真的吗  -你写出来就成真了
- Is that true? - It will be after you write it.

744
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,970
罗伊・科佩尼科是你安排的
Roy Kapeniak was you.

745
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,560
随你怎么想  我不会发表意见
You might very well think that. I couldn't possibly comment.

746
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,140
你找到他了  让他给我打电话
You found him. You had him call me.

747
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,210
科佩尼科和科恩不过是开胃菜  巴恩斯小姐
Kapeniak and Kern were appetizers, Miss Barnes.

748
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,410
凯瑟琳・杜兰特才是主菜
Catherine Durant is the meal.

749
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,090
说出她的名字  凯瑟琳・杜兰特
Say that name: Catherine Durant.

750
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,150
一遍一遍地念叨
Say it over and over.

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,880
明天下午  写出来
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,

752
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,310
然后就等着这名字
and then watch that name

753
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,340
从美国总统嘴里说出来吧
come out of the mouth of the President of the United States.

754
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,570
这是我们创造历史的契机
This is where we get to create.

755
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,530
巴恩斯小姐  别错过这班车了
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

756
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,130
这是今晚最后一班了

杜兰特代替科恩成为提名人

759

据总统身边知情人士透露

凯瑟琳・杜兰特参议员
new nominee for Secretary of State

762
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,460
很可能会代替他成为国务卿提名人
after Michael Kern's withdrawal earlier this week.

763
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:07,710
《华盛顿先驱报》称凯瑟琳・杜兰特将被提名为国务卿

764
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,670
白宫对总统是否会提名杜兰特
The White House has remained silent on whether the president

765
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,350
不予置评
will tap Durant for a nomination,

766
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,030
但是一项全国左格比民调显示
but a national Zogby Poll shows

767
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,530
杜兰特深受两党支持

曾多次在南美执行外交任务

我们可以相信她
We can place our faith in her,

773
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,000
新提名人杜兰特

并深知一位负责  杰出

778
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,990
跟军方高层合作  那就是她
work with the joint chiefs, she's the one.

779
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,490
杜兰特可行  傻子都看得出来
Durant is the way to go. It's a no-brainer.

780
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,880
总统不应该再挑三拣四  选她就对了
The president should stop this pageant and simply make the call.

781
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,410
我们为什么还在讨论
Why are we still talking about,

782
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:39,140
仍未决定

783
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,490
他们是否会提名杜兰特
if they're going to nominate Durant?

784
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,050
他们为什么不赶紧定下
Why don't they just do it already

785
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,480
我们也可以停止猜测
so we can all stop talking about ifs

786
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,280
开始讨论杜兰特会何时
and start talking about when and what

787
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,390
如何制定怎样的外交政策
and how Durant's going to shape up foreign policy...

788
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,610
是历史吗
So, history?

789
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,930
是的
History.

790
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,720
真了不起  弗兰克
I'm very impressed, Frank.

791

好的  你点头了我就起草正式法案了
Good. With your go-ahead, I'll start the mock-up.

792
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,470
博奇和拉斯姆森看过这个了吗
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

793
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,610
还没  我想先拿给你看一眼
Not yet. I wanted you to be the first to have a look.

794
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,480
我会找个时间让你给总统汇报
I'll schedule a time for you to fill in the president.

795
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,690
不用  那是你的工作  你去汇报就好
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda. You should do that.

796
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,080
-谢谢  弗兰克  -荣幸之至  该谢你
- Thank you, Frank. - My pleasure. Thank you.

797
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,480
-对这一切  我万分抱歉  -不不不
- I so apologize for everything-- - No, no, no, n--

798
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,530
没必要
it's not necessary.

799
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,080
现在来谈正事
Now for the real meeting.

800
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,900
迈克尔・科恩怎么回事啊
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

801
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,450
简直是场噩梦
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

802
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,210
接下来要推选谁
You know who you're gonna tap next?

803
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,160
弗兰克  我们需要你留在议会
Frank, we still need you in the house--

804
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,490
不不不  我可不敢奢望
No, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it.

805
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,910
我们还要忙法案呢  我只是问问
We've got our education bill. I was just curious.

806
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,580
不知为什么  到处盛传
Somehow the rumor is flying around

807
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,520
我们将提名凯瑟琳・杜兰特
that we're gonna nominate Catherine Durant.

808
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,320
-你一定注意到了  -传言是真的吗
- I'm sure you've noticed. - Is the rumor true?

809
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,760
刚开始我们并未考虑她
Well, we weren't considering her at first,

810
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,260
但总统让我审查她
but the president asked me to have her vetted

811
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
以备我们选择她
in case we wanna go that route.

812
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,590
-有意思  -你觉得呢
- Interesting. - What do you think?

813
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,060
她不会是我的首选
Well, she wouldn't be my first choice--

814
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,430
谁会是你的首选
Who would be your first choice?

815
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,040
初选时她跟我们斗得厉害呢
She campaigned hard against us in the primaries.

816
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,180
这也是我的顾虑
That's my reservation.

817
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,530
但这会显得你顾全大局
But you'd show yourself above party politics,

818
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,450
而且我知道她会全力以赴的
and I know she'd work all the harder for it.

819
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,490
履历漂亮  在两党都受人尊敬
Decent experience, respect across the aisle.

820
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,520
所以她真的值得考虑吗
So you think we can seriously consider her?

821
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,160
反正不是最糟的选择
It's not the worst idea in the world.

822
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,090
你从哪搞来的消息
Where are you getting this shit?

823
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,660
什么
What?

824
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,530
你的报道
Your stories.

825
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,050
-我只是  -你跟谁上床了
- I was just- - Who are you fucking?

826
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,920
-没有  -少来了
- Nobody. - Oh, come on.

827
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,460
你不过是个小人物  现在瞧瞧你
You're a metro scrub, and now look at you.

828
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,740
你一定跟某个重要人物上床了
You'd have to be fucking somebody important.

829
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,980
我只是做了我的工作  简宁
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

830
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,140
失陪了
Excuse me.

831
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,750
都搞定了
All set.

832
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,680
-第一次远程采访吗  -是的  第一次
- Is this your first remote? - Yeah, it's my first time.

833
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,460
看着镜头  坐在椅子上别动
Right into the camera, don't shift in your seat,

834
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,340
说话音量别过高
and there's no reason to speak above a conversational volume.

835
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,220
麦克风录得到
The mic will pick you up.

836
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,420
-准备好了吗  -好了
- You all ready? - Yeah.

837
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,860
好的  注意呼吸
All right. Don't forget to breathe.

838
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,680

Five, four...

853
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,120
第一次报道国家新闻
First national story,

854
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,110
第一次头版署名

I would wave to my mom,

857
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,580
但摄像师不让我在座位上动
but the cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

858
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,730
真是风云突变
What a roller coaster.

859
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,820
真是不幸  科恩是个好人
It really is too bad. Kern was a good man.

860

-现在是凯瑟琳・杜兰特  -是的
- And now Catherine Durant. - Yes.

-我们喜欢她吗  -非常喜欢

863
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,400
问题是她是否像我们喜欢她一样喜欢桑科
Question is, does she like Sancorp as much as we like her?

864
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,580
我觉得值得压一注
I would say that that is a very good bet.

865
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,420
但话说回来  我不是个赌徒
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

866

870

糟糕  我点错了
Oh, no. I charged the wrong thing.

871
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,250
-您要什么来着  -中杯脱因拿铁
- What did you have again? - A medium decaf latte.

872

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,240
我不知道怎么退回去
I don't know how to get it to go back.

874
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,890
-点这个和这个  -这个吗
- This one and this one. - This one?

875
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,080
不是  我来吧
No. Let me do it.

876
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,620
您得退后  议员
I have to ask you to stay back, congressman.

877
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,400
怎么回事
What's going on?

878
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,940
这个家伙试图进入楼内
Some guy was trying to get into the building.

879
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,470
被我们拒绝后  他就开始撕衣服
When we said no, he started tearing his clothes off.

880
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,800
没人听得见  没人在乎
Nobody can hear you. Nobody cares about you.

881
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,150
这样做毫无用处
Nothing will come of this.

882
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,210
让这几位先生带你回家吧
Why don't you let these nice gentlemen take you home?

883
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,450
给他盖上  外面很冷
Cover him up. It's cold out here.

884
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,550
你听到了
You heard the congressman.

885
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,350
给他盖上
Cover him up.

886

该剧在Netflix上线时
正值美国国务卿希拉里正式卸任  新任国务卿克里宣誓就职
奥巴马连任后  第一个记者招待会就明确表示
希望原驻联合国大使苏珊・赖斯接替希拉里担任新一任国务卿
却遭共和党很多议员强烈反对
因为赖斯曾经在2012年9月16号
接受5家电视台访问称  9月11日美国驻利比亚大使馆被袭击
是当地群众示威失控所致  但后来媒体发现
那其实是一场有组织有预谋的恐怖袭击  所以赖斯涉嫌误导公众
在被媒体和议员们猛烈攻击后  赖斯对外宣传放弃谋求国务卿职位
白宫重新选择参议员克里作提名人  克里非常顺利地被国会通过
与本剧情节不谋而合
