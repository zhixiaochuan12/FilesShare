敌人进攻  你临阵脱逃

现在你该付出代价了
Now it's time to splatter your brains everywhere.

投票将会势均力敌
This is gonna be a close vote.

31
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,590
你们大多同僚不愿在25个选区
Most of your colleagues are not gonna wanna spend

32
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,730
投入这么多钱
this amount of money in just 25 districts.

33
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,410
尽量先说服他们
Try persuasion first.

34
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,790
要点包含在备忘录里
Talking points are in your packets.

35
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,980
如果想了解更多详情
And if you want more detailed information...

36
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,180
调查  数据  可以联系吉莉安或我本人
research, statistics... you can contact Gillian or myself.

37
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,220
如果要做人情  找道格
And when it comes to doling out favors, talk to Doug.

38
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,880
要是那还不行  直接来找我  彼得
If favors don't work, come to me directly. Peter.

39
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,810
我将在宾州展开竞选活动
I'll be campaigning in Pennsylvania.

40
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,190
这周所有的竞选活动
All my events this week

41
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,870
都安排在流域内的几个郡
will be in counties within the watershed,

42
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
我会来应对媒体
so I'll be working the media angle.

43
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,260
如果需要我跟谁电话详谈
But if you need me to get on the phone with anybody,

44
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,040
联系克里斯蒂娜
reach out to Christina.

45
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,220
她会帮我做安排
She'll work it into my schedule.

46
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,300
我有话直说了  弗兰克
I have to say, Frank,

47
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,830
拨款两亿很难博得支持
$200 million is going to be a hard sell.

48
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,230
天然气公司的说客已经开始奋力抵制了
The natural gas lobby's already putting up a big fight.

49
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,640
我们的立足点是提供就业机会
We need to make this about jobs.

50
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,580
但开采行业
But the drilling industry

51
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,510
能比法案提供更多的就业机会
can offer far more jobs than this bill can.

52
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,850
我们的法案并不威胁那些岗位
This bill doesn't threaten those jobs,

53
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,840
它只是确保了开采过程的可靠负责
it just makes sure the drilling is done responsibly.

54
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,360
此外还能增加更多就业机会
It adds more jobs on top of that.

55
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,890
桑科已就改竞选经费跟我谈过了
I've already been approached by Sancorp with reelection funds.

56
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,260
我也是  他们向我提供的资助
I have too. They offered me a donation package

57
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,100
来自八个不同的钻探公司
from eight different drilling companies.

58
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,530
-雷米・丹顿  -是的
- Remy Danton? - Yep.

59
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,180
雷米还找过谁
How many of you been approached by Remy?

60
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,400
我知道很难拒绝金钱
Look, I know it's not easy to turn down money.

61
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,870
但如果让共和党控制了宾州的选区重划
But if the Republicans control redistricting in Pennsylvania,

62
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,470
我们会在下次竞选中失去多数席位
we lose the house next election,

63
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,380
你们也保不住各自委员会的主席身份
and all of you lose your committee chairmanships.

64
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,680
这一仗我们要为彼得打赢
This is a feather that we need in Peter's hat.

65
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,490
法案不通过会危及他的胜算
A loss on this bill endangers his chance of winning,

66
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,080
我们要努力保住多数党的席位
and we are fighting to keep our majority here.

67
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,910
还有疑问吗
Any other concerns?

68
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,180
明天下午四点前拿出第一次计票结果
I want a first vote count by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

69
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,440
非常感谢诸位
Thank you all very much.

70
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,450
太残酷了  三天要跑22站
It's brutal. 22 stops in three days.

71
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,930
-只能在车上睡觉了  -哪有时间睡觉
- That's a lot of sleeping on the bus. - No sleeping.

72
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,740
我只能在车里干活儿了
That bus is the only place I can get work done.

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,090
98年弗兰西斯也曾去巡回竞选
You know, Francis did a big bus tour in '98,

74
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,320
有一次车下坡时刹车失灵了
and the bus lost its brakes going down a hill,

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,840
结果冲进了烟草地里
and we landed in a tobacco field.

76
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,260
他下了车  敲开农民的门
He gets out of the car, knocks on the farmer's door,

77
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
写了张支票  赔偿损坏的庄稼
writes a check for all the damaged crops,

78
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,200
还借来了卡车  好赶去下一战的活动
and then borrows his pickup so he doesn't miss the next event.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,110
还挺有意思的
And it was actually fun.

80
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,010
他开车  我坐副驾
He was driving. I was shotgun.

81
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,800
工作人员都坐在平板挂车里
We had the whole staff in the flatbed.

82
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,440
我们还提前十分钟就到了
We actually got there ten minutes early.

83
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,480
我觉得我该在这儿争取选票
I think I should be here to help drum up votes.

84
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,590
小心  议员先生  非常烫
Careful, sir. It's very hot.

85
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,380
你和副总统会引起全国媒体的注意
Look, you and the vice president will get national coverage.

86
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,780
这就有助于我们得票了
That's gonna help us with the count.

87
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,780
我联系过他了  但他没答复我
I reached out to him. He never got back to me.

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,010
我都不确定他是否知道法案的要点
I don't know if he even knows the talking points about the bill.

89
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,140
我看吉姆并不想去
I don't think Jim wants to go.

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,050
他只是看总统和我的面子
He's doing it as a favor to the president and I,

91
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,140
所以他知不知道要点都无关紧要
so it doesn't matter if he doesn't know the talking points.

92
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,610
人们看到他和气的样子就够了
You know, people wanna see him be folksy, you know?

93
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,670
就迁就他一下  给他几分...
So just humor him. Show him some degree of...

94
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,610
天呐
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,140
-没事吧  -不是故意的
- Are you okay? - It was an accident.

96
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,270
我们该走了  非常抱歉
Okay, it's time for us to go. I'm so sorry.

97
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,330
没事  用冷水冲一下就好了
It's all right. I just need to run it under some cold water.

98
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,280
我不打算说假话
I'm not going to lie.

99
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,180
我讨厌小孩
I despise children.

100
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,570
我就这么说了
There. I've said it.

101
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,500
你怎么能这样呢
You can't act like that in here.

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,490
-你得懂点事  -我知道
- You have to be a big boy. - I know.

103
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,670
彼得  我们真得走了
Peter, we really need to get going.

104
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,360
我们已经因为开会错过了一班飞机
We've already missed one flight because the meeting went over.

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
我又订了9点25的那班  但是...
I booked us another one at 9:25, but...

106
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,590
我们得送孩子去学校
We have to drop the kids off at school.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,010
这样时间就太紧了
It's going to be really tight.

108
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,180
错过了这趟航班  第一站活动就得取消了
If we miss this plane, we have to cancel our first event.

109
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,080
南茜  能送他们吗
Nancy, can you take them?

110
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,080
我得准备午餐小组会议的备忘录
I've gotta get packets ready for the lunchtime sub-caucuses.

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,150
彼得  我很想帮你
Peter, I'd do it,

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,850
但我们20分钟后要跟绿色和平会面
but we have a meeting with Greenpeace in 20 minutes.

113
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,280
我需要他们对法案的民意调查
I gotta get their rating on the bill.

114
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,370
他们学校在哪
Where's their school?

115
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,370
康涅狄格街和Q街街角
Connecticut and Q.

116
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,260
-我来送他们吧  -可以吗
- Oh, I can take them. - You sure?

117
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,250
没问题  正好顺路
Yes. It's on the way to my office.

118
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,760
这项流域法案再次证明
This watershed act proves that once again

119
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,520
反资本主义的议程
the anti-capitalist agenda

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,210
依然在民主党内盛行
is alive and well in the Democratic party.

121
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,830
让我告诉你到底是怎么回事
Let me show you what's really going on.

122
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,170
这是民主党人在吞下
Here are the democrats eating up all of their

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:21,790
民主党人

124
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,850
环保狂热分子给他们强行灌输的
soft science, "Organically homegrown" propaganda

125
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,340
软科学和"有机自产"理念
that the eco-fanatics are force-feeding them.

126
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,450
而这里  是那些蠢事造成的后果
And over here, at the tail end of all those jackasses,

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:32,610
努力工作的中产阶级

128
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,400
就是美国中产阶级
are middle-class Americans...

129
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,950
那些只想努力工作
people who just want to work hard

130
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,830
靠开采业谋生的人
and rely on jobs in the drilling industry.

131
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:46,120
彼得・罗素  州长

132
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,200
那这个伪君子呢
And what about the hypocrisy, folks?

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,060
彼得・罗素还真敢
Does Peter Russo honestly have the gall

134
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,490
教训我们要净化河流
to lecture us on the purity of our rivers

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,330
而他多年来一直用化学品污染自己
when he has been polluting himself with chemicals for years?

136
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,930
他不止吃草  还吸食[大麻]
He's not just been eating grass, he's been smoking it.

137
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,580
这是他六年来发起的唯一一份重要法案
It's the only major bill he's sponsored in six years.

138
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,460
我知道  但报道已经覆盖全国
I know, but they already have national coverage.

139
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,100
你想写什么
What's the angle?

140
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,100
如果法案没通过
If it doesn't pass,

141
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,770
我想他会失去船厂协会的支持
I think he'll lose support from the shipbuilders' association.

142
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,960
失去支持  这不够劲爆
So they lose support. It's not that juicy.

143
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,470
船厂协会是他在费城拉票的重头戏
They're a huge part of his get-out-the-vote effort in Philly.

144
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,260
一般人看不懂的
It sounds like inside baseball.

145
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,440
要是能把票数摆在那儿就清楚明白了
Not if I get the vote count. Black and white numbers.

146
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,290
没人报道这个  但我打给竞选办公室
Nobody has that. But when I called the campaign,

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,700
他们口风很紧
they stonewalled me.

148
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,880
党鞭办公室也一样
Same thing in the whip's office.

149
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,260
你那里有认识的人吗
Do you know anyone over there?

150
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,560
安德伍德办公室
In Underwood's office?

151
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,860
不  没有
No, I don't.

152
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,950
一个都不认识
Nobody on staff?

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,380
毕竟是你给了我罗素的专访
I just figured because you gave me the Russo profile.

154
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,590
不  不是他们给我的
No, that didn't come from them.

155
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,970
但安德伍德组织了竞选
But Underwood organized the campaign.

156
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,440
抱歉  我不认识那儿的人
I'm sorry. I don't know anybody there.

157
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,230
好吧
Okay.

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
是我  我有些事要告诉你
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to fill you in on something.

159
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,630
大概晚上10点到家  我家见
I should be back home at 10:00. Meet me there.

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
-这是萨拉折的  -是青蛙
- Sarah made this one. - It's a frog.

161
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,120
我折了这只  你猜是什么
And I made this one. Can you guess what it is?

162
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,850
-龙虾  -不对  是蝎子
- A lobster? - No. It's a scorpion.

163
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,980
送给你的  谢谢你的天鹅
They're for you. For the ones you gave us.

164
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,270
真漂亮
Aw, they're beautiful.

165
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,660
可你不想带去学校吗
But maybe you should bring them to school, no?

166
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,390
向同学展示一下  或者送给朋友
For show-and-tell? Or give them to your friends.

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,680
不  其他孩子只会嘲笑我们
No. The other kids will just make fun of us.

168
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,450
为什么
Why?

169
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,990
学校里人人讨厌我们
Everybody hates us at school.

170
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,570
他们说爸爸是瘾君子  我们是毒宝宝
They say dad's a crackhead and that we're crack babies.

171
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,570
毒宝宝: 吸食可卡因的母亲所生的孩子

172
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,530
我上网查过"毒宝宝"
I looked up "Crack baby" on the computer.

173
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,810
我不长那样
I don't look like that.

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
他们说爸爸会像艾米・怀恩豪斯那样吸毒致死
Yeah, they say dad's gonna O.D. like Amy Winehouse.

175
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
艾米・怀恩豪斯: 英国歌手  2011年死于家中

176
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,370
那就告诉他们
Well, you tell them

177
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,480
你们爸爸已经戒毒了
that your dad doesn't do that kind of thing anymore, right?

178
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,720
我们说了  但没人相信
Yeah, we do, but they don't believe us.

179
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,640
你们试过找老师吗
Did you try going to the teachers?

180
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,950
不能那么做  大家只会更讨厌我们
We can't do that. Everyone will just hate us even more.

181
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,810
不能太在乎别人怎么想  是不是
Well, you can't worry about what other people think, right?

182
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,350
真希望爸爸不竞选州长
I wish dad wasn't running for Governor.

183
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,660
-你之前来过艾伦镇吗  -没有
- You ever been to Allentown before? - I have not.

184
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,680
你觉得这里怎么样
What do you think?

185
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,440
比起纽约  停车容易些
Compared to New York, the parking is easier.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,980
想找好百吉饼就没那么容易了
Finding a decent bagel, not so much.

187
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,750
但我们有奶油干酪
We make up for it with the cream cheese.

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,210
-开始吗  -你准备好就开始
- Shall we? - Ready when you are.

189
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,530
你的流域法案
Your watershed bill.

190
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,030
你惹火了共和党  石油业  天然气业
You've ticked off the Republicans, oil, gas...

191
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,060
有时为了做正确的事  难免要惹一些人
Sometimes you gotta upset a few people to do the right thing.

192
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,850
不只是一些人
Not just a few.

193
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,160
希望你法案失败的人加起来可不少
There's a sizable coalition that wants to see your bill fail,

194
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,420
包括民主党内的环保人士
including environmentalists from your own party.

195
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,590
他们认为法案不尽如人意  
Don't think the bill does enough.

196
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,610
我们的目的是通过法案
We wanted a passable bill.

197
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,940
所以法案没有太苛刻
That's why we aimed for middle ground...

198
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,140
你真的关心特拉华河吗
Do you actually care about the Delaware river?

199
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,100
我不会发起自己不关心的法案
I don't sponsor legislation I don't care about.

200
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,560
在此之前  你从未发起过任何法案
Until recently, you hadn't sponsored any legislation at all.

201
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,760
我在国会集中精力做
I spent my time in congress focusing on things

202
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,350
对我选民重要的事
that were important to my constituents.

203
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,550
造船厂
The shipyard.

204
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,010
我已经尽可能维持了
Kept it open as long as I could.

205
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,940
好  这算一件事  还有别的吗
Okay. That's one thing. What are the others?

206
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,920
我很乐意一一列举
I'd love to provide you a list

207
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,710
我在国会做过的事
of all the things I've done in congress,

208
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,530
但我们只有15分钟
but we've got 15 minutes...

209
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,620
你的反对者认为你的无作为
Your opponent has linked your inactivity

210
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,090
与你嗜饮纯麦芽酒有关
to your fondness for single-malts.

211
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,430
我对自己的过去很坦诚
I've been very open about my past,

212
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,970
我已经竭尽全力去克服它
and I've done everything I can to overcome it

213
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,940
负责且永远地戒酒了
in a responsible, permanent way.

214
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,410
而且比起威士忌  我更喜欢伏特加
And I preferred vodka to scotch.

215
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,630
你该查清楚了再说
You should get your facts straight.

216
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,270
你的流域法案
Is your watershed act

217
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,570
是不是你为竞选州长
just a ploy to jump into the spotlight

218
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,020
用来增加曝光和政绩的策略
and pad your transcript while you apply for Governor school?

219
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,020
钱是真的
It's real money.

220
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,850
工作是真的
It's real jobs.

221
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,590
等特拉华河呈现50年来
And when the Delaware river is less

222
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,330
未有的清澈
polluted than it's been in 50 years...

223
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,620
我们就能举起一杯真正的河水
it's holding up a real glass of its water

224
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,200
看看它有多干净
and seeing how clear it is.

225
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,790
这就是我巡回竞选的目的
That's what my bus tour is about.

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,150
-副总统随后也会加入  -没错
- The vice president is joining you later? - Correct.

227
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,050
他怎么这么久才表示支持
Why has it taken him this long to endorse you?

228
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,890
他觉得我不够格
He didn't think I was worth it.

229
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,370
但他听说《纽约时报》要对我进行单独采访
But then he heard I had a one-on-one with the New York Times,

230
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,550
便立刻决定入伙了
and, boom, he was on board.

231
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,820
这话我可能会登出来
I might print that.

232
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,210
多保留我的原话  少添油加醋
The more of my words, the fewer of yours,

233
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,010
这样对我们都好
the better off we'll both be.

234
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,430
议员先生  如果不是认为你会拖累自己
If I didn't think you were such a liability to yourself, congressman,

235
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,340
我没准会喜欢你
I might even like you.

236
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,420
如果你们的发行量能赶上《华尔街日报》
If your circulation was as high as the Wall Street Journal,

237
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,560
我没准也会喜欢你
I might like you back.

238
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,260
放马过来吧  下一个问题
Hit me. Next question.

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,830
我必须得做出反抗  弗兰克
I have to put up a fight, Frank.

240
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,260
告诉他们  这是在浪费钱
Tell them they're wasting their money.

241
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,250
-法案会通过的  -你确定
- It's gonna pass. - Are you sure?

242
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,480
我什么时候失算过
When was the last time I got a count wrong?

243
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,310
你真这么有把握  就不必来打压我们了
If you were certain, you wouldn't be trying to neutralize us.

244
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,440
桑科向来待我不薄
Well, Sancorp has been good to me.

245
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,580
我只是想帮你和他们一个忙  雷米
I'm just trying to do you and them a favor, Remy.

246
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,490
那当初为什么要提议这一法案
Then why propose the legislation in the first place?

247
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,840
你肯定知道他们会反对
You must've known they would oppose it.

248
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,560
法案中的监管限制很少
The regulatory restrictions are minimal.

249
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,090
这关乎大局  弗兰克
There's a bigger battle here, Frank.

250
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,430
桑科反对一切监管举措
Sancorp is against any step toward regulation,

251
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,730
无论力度多小
no matter how small.

252
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,900
罗素这是站错队了
Russo's planted his feet on the wrong side of the fence.

253
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,470
你们给了他对手多少钱
How much are you giving his opponent?

254
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,400
去查联邦竞选委员会的报告
Check the F.E.C. filings.

255
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,850
你们实际给了多少
How much are you actually giving?

256
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,710
这可是价值百亿的产业  弗兰克
This is a ten-billion-dollar industry, Frank.

257
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,710
有的是闲钱
There's money to spend.

258
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,090
如果民主党失掉了宾州
If the democrats lose Pennsylvania,

259
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,240
后果你很清楚
you know what that means.

260
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,450
我们不希望你丢了饭碗
We don't want you to lose leadership,

261
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,940
但这取决于你  不是我们
but that's up to you, not us.

262
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
你们和共和党人之间
You don't have the same kind of relationship

263
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,860
可没有和我这般的关系
with the republicans that you have with me.

264
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,060
那我们就顺应改变
Then we'll adapt.

265
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,680
我们都还得算选票  祝你好运
We both have votes to count. Good luck.

266
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,150
去告诉桑科  这是在犯傻
You tell Sancorp they're being foolish.

267
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,430
我不会说的
I'm not gonna do that.

268
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,280
那么你就是在犯傻
Well, then, you're being foolish.

269
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,360
别这样  弗兰克
Come on, Frank.

270
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,580
不要人身攻击
Let's not make this personal.

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,710
桑科资金雄厚  我难以匹敌
I can't compete with Sancorp's war chest.

272
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,700
我只能采取不同于他们的策略
My only option is asymmetrical...

273
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,890
逐个击破敌人
to pick off the opposition one by one

274
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,600
就像林中的狙击手
like a sniper in the woods.

275
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,940
总有一天  我的准星会对向雷米
There will come a time to put Remy in my crosshairs,

276
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,230
但现在时机未到
but not right now.

277
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,100
加夫尼那里有句老话
As we used to say in Gaffney,

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,950
千万别惹正嚼烟草的人
never slap a man while he's chewing tobacco.

279
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,470
罗素竞选州长  崭新的开始

280
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,140
议员先生  你好
Congressman, how are you?

281
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,610
您百忙之中前来  我深表感谢
I deeply appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule...

282
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,040
汉克  我要吃东西
Hank, I need to eat.

283
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,360
去给我弄份总会三明治  双份培根
See if you can muster up a club sandwich, extra bacon.

284
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,630
真不给面子
Fuck me.

285
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,460
我又买了泰国菜
Thai cuisine again.

286
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,520
绿咖喱是给你的  另一份绿咖喱是我的
The green curry is for you, and the other green curry is for me.

287
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,070
我正要出去呢
I was actually just on my way out.

288
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,680
我给你买了晚饭  你必须得吃
I bought you dinner. You have to eat it.

289
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,060
至少也得看着我吃
Or at the very least, you have to watch me eat mine.

290
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,720
我约见别人  要迟到了
I'm gonna be late to meet someone.

291
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,610
-谁啊  约会吗  -一个朋友
- Who? Like a date? - A friend.

292
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,400
那位给你爆料的神秘炮友
Oh, the mysterious fuck-buddy who you get all of your stories from?

293
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,940
别这么严肃  我逗你玩呢
Lighten up. I was just teasing.

294
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,590
而且我也不会说什么
Not that I would judge.

295
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,700
我也干过这事
We've all done it.

296
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,160
从前为了挖新闻  
I used to suck, screw,

297
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,820
我不择手段  谁都敢上
and jerk anything that moved just to get a story.

298
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,780
真的吗  都有谁
Really? Like who?

299
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,070
你也想去试试
You want dish?

300
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,470
不  只是
No. It's just...

301
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,750
本・施罗德竞选参议员时的媒体关系主管
The com director on Ben Schroeder's senate race.

302
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,990
国防部的一个职员
A staffer in the Defense Department.

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,820
还有个白宫实习生
My very own White House intern.

304
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,230
他嘴没占着的时候可能说了
He was a real blabbermouth when he wasn't eating me out.

305
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,880
我甚至还跟一名国会议员发生过关系
And I even had a fling with a congressman.

306
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,080
哪个议员
Which one?

307
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,470
告诉我你的  我就跟你说
You tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine.

308
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,720
我没睡过议员
I've never been with any.

309
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,760
少来了  你这么性感  
Oh, come on. You're hot.

310
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,370
他们就没人对你有过意思
You're telling me that none of them have come on to you?

311
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,980
没在那个圈子里混过
I haven't really been in those circles.

312
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,240
你现在进圈子了
You are now.

313
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,530
可能我没有那种气质
I guess I don't really give off that vibe.

314
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,250
你是说荡妇气质吗
Oh, you mean the slut vibe?

315
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,420
听着  我现在不那么干了
Look, I don't do that shit anymore.

316
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,590
因为话一传开
'Cause once word got out,

317
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,180
我就四处碰壁  没人拿我当回事
it was like I hit a wall, and nobody took me seriously.

318
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,920
就职场策略而言  给你一点建议
So, a piece of advice as far as career strategies go:

319
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,030
为了一点点地位跟人上床不值得
It's not worth fucking your way to the middle.

320
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
用筷子还是叉子
Chopsticks or fork?

321
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,200
你要是走了  我就得吃两份了
Look, if you go, I am gonna have to eat both of these,

322
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,050
弗兰克・安德伍德

323
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,230
那可不好
and that is not cool.

324
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,360
不  我留下跟你一起吃
No. I'll eat with you.

325
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,140
好的
Good.

326
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,650
大概晚半小时到

327
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,150
我从不等人

328
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,360
回家  密查姆
Back home, Meechum.

329
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,030
是
Sir.

330
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,770
弗兰西斯
Francis...

331
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,570
你的手怎么样了
How's your hand?

332
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,110
还好
Fine.

333
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,960
不是该换绷带了吗
You should change the bandage, no?

334
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,830
待会儿
Later.

335
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,670
你不是要晚归吗
I thought you were gonna be out late.

336
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,580
不
No.

337
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,310
-你好像心情不好  -没有
- You seem upset. - I'm not.

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,530
-发生了什么事  -没事
- What happened? - Nothing.

339
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,650
你能多说两个字吗
Can I get more than two words out of you?

340
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,670
我只是在放松
I'm just trying to relax.

341
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,290
克莱尔
Claire,

342
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,850
我爱你
I love you.

343
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,890
我也爱你
I love you too.

344
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,890
佐伊指望我焦躁难安地等她吗
Did Zoe expect me to twiddle my thumbs until her arrival?

345
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,180
我看她是搞错了
Perhaps she's making the mistake

346
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,740
以为她的时间和我的一样宝贵
thinking her time is as valuable as mine.

347
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,170
接近权力让一些人错以为他们拥有权力
Proximity to power deludes some into believing they wield it.

348
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,830
我要把这种错觉扼杀在萌芽中
I put an end to that sort of thinking before it begins.

349
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,450
如果我没记错  上次来坦纳斯维尔时
And if I'm not mistaken, the last time I was in Tannersville,

350
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,190
巴蒂・寇克兰把我拉到一边
Buddy Corcharan pulled me aside

351
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,780
跟我说我这是在浪费时间
and told me I was wasting my time,

352
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,880
因为共和党
because the Republicans

353
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,680
在门罗郡会以压倒性的优势获胜
were gonna sweep Monroe County in a landslide.

354
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,020
巴蒂后来只得吃掉他的帽子和鞋
Well, Buddy had to eat his hat and both his shoes

355
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,020
eat one's hat and shoes  赌输了吃掉帽子和鞋

356
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,830
因为是我以压倒性优势赢得了本郡
when I won the county in a landslide.

357
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,060
而且  他有双大脚
And let me tell you, that man has big feet

358
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,250
头更大  够他好好吃一顿了
and an even bigger head, so that was quite a meal.

359
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,750
我爸爸曾给我讲过一个故事
My daddy used to tell me a story

360
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,160
说在小鸡孵出之前就数有几个的人
about people who count their chickens before they hatched.

361
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,400
不过说实话
Although, to be fair,

362
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,780
他大概根本不知道自己在说什么
he probably didn't know what he was talking about,

363
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,560
因为他是匹兹堡人
because he grew up in Pittsburgh.

364
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,880
我家周围也没有一只母鸡
And I certainly never saw a hen around my house,

365
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,270
除非你把我妈也算上
unless you count my mother.

366
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,470
-要我插手吗  -但是  说正经的...
- Do you want me to do something? - But, seriously,

367
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,790
-不用  让他说  -我很爱这座城市...
- No. Let him talk. - ...I do love this town...

368
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,770
我不觉得他会引你出场
I don't know if he's ever going to introduce you.

369
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,030
因为它仍有拓荒者的气质
Because it still has that frontier spirit.

370
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,730
他会的  给他点时间
He will. Just give him time.

371
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,810
都一小时了
It's been an hour.

372
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,800
我们十分钟前就该去卡本代尔了
We were supposed to leave for Carbondale ten minutes ago.

373
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,650
我不能打断他  他可是副总统
I can't interrupt him. He's the Vice President.

374
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,520
我们又不是在宾州边境上
We're not on the edge of Penn's Woods.

375
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,640
我们得把流域法案的经济发展
We need economic development flowcharts

376
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,170
流程图送交泰瑞・乌麦克办公室
for the watershed bill sent over to Terry Womack's office.

377
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,150
-打印稿  20份  -我就去办
- Hard copies, 20 of them. - I'll do it right away.

378
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,480
瑞秋怎么样了
How's everything going with Rachel?

379
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,550
心情不怎么好
I think she's a little down in the dumps.

380
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,950
上周她找到份服务员的工作
She got a waitressing job last week,

381
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,180
但又被解雇了
and then they let her go.

382
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,780
-为什么  -她不告诉我
- Why? - She wouldn't tell me.

383
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,740
就说老板是个变态
All she said was her boss was a creep.

384
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,150
30分钟前  佐伊给我发了条短信
Thirty minutes ago, I received a text from Zoe.

385
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,510
毫无疑问  她想道歉
She intends to apologize, no doubt.

386
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,150
我尊重她想当面忏悔的意愿
I respect that she wants to atone in person,

387
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,540
尽管她花了16个小时才鼓起勇气
even though it's taken her over 16 hours to build up the courage.

388
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,520
简宁・斯克斯基正在调查彼得・罗素
Janine Skorsky is digging into Peter Russo.

389
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,390
具体什么方面
What in particular?

390
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,050
造船厂协会
The shipbuilders' association.

391
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,410
她要怎么写
She have an angle?

392
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,010
流域法案是对他们失去工作的补偿
The watershed bill is a consolation prize for them losing their jobs.

393
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,590
这话说的有点道理
That's not an unfair assessment.

394
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,370
她认为如果法案没有通过
She thinks if the bill fails to pass,

395
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,800
他就会失去船厂的支持
they'll withdraw support.

396
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,600
推测得有点道理
Not an unfair speculation.

397
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,600
我知道你为他的竞选付出了很多
Well, I know how hard you've been working on his campaign,

398
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,950
想给你提个醒
so I wanted to give you a heads-up.

399
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,990
如果她扩大调查告诉我一声
Well, let me know if she expands her inquiry.

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,320
-扩大到哪  -你认为值得说的
- Into what? - Anything you deem worth telling.

401
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,340
我能先给她点甜头吗
Well, can I throw her a bone?

402
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,950
如果我透点消息给她  她可能更肯说
She might be more talkative if I have information for her.

403
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,590
-什么样的甜头  -法案的计票结果
- What sort of bone? - The vote count for the bill.

404
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,160
计票还没出来
I don't have a vote count yet.

405
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,690
下午会有个初步结果
Should have a preliminary one this afternoon.

406
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,710
-你会告诉我吗  -有确实消息就告诉你
- You'll let me know? - As soon as I have something solid.

407
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,830
还有件事
There's one more thing.

408
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,240
昨天晚上...
About last night...

409
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,440
不用道歉
Oh, no need to apologize.

410
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,460
你肯定有个充足的理由
I'm sure you had a very good reason.

411
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,230
是的
I do.

412
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,690
我觉得我们不应该继续了
I think we should end it.

413
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,720
不是公事方面  另一方面
Not professionally, the other thing.

414
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,780
为什么是现在
Why now?

415
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,930
我们的工作关系很好
We have a really good working relationship.

416
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,190
我不想搞得过于复杂
I don't wanna overcomplicate that.

417
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,300
可以
All right.

418
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,520
-你没有意见  -完全没有
- You're okay with it? - Completely.

419
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,600
结束了
It's over.

420
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,270
我们之间的合作不会受到影响
And it won't change things in terms of our arrangement?

421
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,320
当然  我不会为一个成熟的决定而惩罚人
Oh, please. I don't punish people for making adult decisions.

422
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,850
谢谢你  弗兰西斯
Thank you, Francis.

423
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,790
她于我微若尘埃
She was never more than a faint blip on my radar.

424
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,150
我们互相利用
We've served each other's purpose.

425
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,840
她想做个成年人
If she wants to be an adult,

426
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,820
就让她看看离巢之后她能飞多远
let her see how she can fly once she leaves the nest.

427
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,670
-克莱尔  -凯瑟琳
- Claire. - Catherine.

428
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,750
谢谢给我时间
Thank you for fitting me in.

429
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,670
对你和弗兰克我总是有空的
Oh, I can always find time for you and Frank.

430
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,200
我来是因为净水计划
Well, the reason I'm here is the C.W.I. has

431
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,170
有一大批滤水器卡在了南苏丹
a large shipment of water filters stuck in South Sudan,

432
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,120
过去四个月一直放在仓库里
and they've been in storage for the past four months,

433
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,900
就放在那儿  苏丹政府...
just sitting there, and the Sudanese government...

434
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,380
不肯让海关放这批货
Won't release the shipments through customs.

435
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,520
我的助理向我汇报了最新进展
My deputy briefed me on the latest.

436
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,060
好  我知道弗兰西斯
Right. And I know that Francis

437
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,570
不久前也跟你提过
spoke to you about this not too long ago,

438
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,810
但最近国务院没有什么消息
but lately we haven't heard much from the state department,

439
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
我就想能不能找你帮忙
so I was wondering if you could help.

440
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,990
我们已经尽力了  克莱尔
We've done our best, Claire.

441
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,480
我调了最有能力的人去处理
I put my top people on this.

442
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,510
苏丹那边就是不给回应
The Sudanese are just not responding.

443
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,750
我们还能做些什么吗
Well, is there anything else we can do?

444
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,540
那可是价值超过二十万的设备
There's over $200,000 worth of equipment.

445
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,700
我也想帮你  我知道这对你有多重要
I wish I could. I know how important this is to you,

446
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,000
但我们即将断绝邦交
but we're about to cut off diplomatic ties.

447
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,570
这是总统直接下达的指令
It's a directive straight from the President.

448
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,530
我们无法继续忽视他们违反人权的行为
We can't ignore their human rights violations anymore.

449
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,660
非正式的途径呢
What about back channels?

450
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,070
一旦断绝邦交  无论正式还是非正式
Well, once we cut ties, I can't contact their government

451
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,780
我都不能联系他们的政府
officially or unofficially.

452
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,820
你能帮我联系上什么人吗
Well, is there someone you could put me in touch with?

453
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,160
抱歉  克莱尔  我无能为力
I'm sorry, Claire. My hands are tied.

454
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,510
我愿意为你和弗兰克上刀山
I would move mountains for you and Frank,

455
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,110
但我已经尽力了
but I've done all I can.

456
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,950
当然
Of course.

457
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,850
-见到你很高兴  -我也是
- Okay. Good to see you. - You too.

458
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,080
议员  这周晚些时候
Congressman, you have a major bill

459
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,540
你将有部重要法案进行投票
going to the floor later this week.

460
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,310
-你有信心它会通过吗  -非常有信心
- Are you optimistic it'll pass? - I'm very optimistic.

461
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,670
《特拉华河流域法案》不仅能保护
The Delaware river watershed Act not only protects

462
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,060
州内大部分淡水资源
large portions of the state's freshwater resources,

463
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,990
还能创造数以千计的工作岗位
it also creates thousands of jobs.

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,890
我有信心  国会的同事...
I'm confident that my colleagues on the Hill...

465
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,630
促进就业只有一个办法
There's only one way to create jobs.

466
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,180
我任州长时曾实施过
I did it during my administration.

467
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,910
就是减免小公司的税额
The answer is tax credits for small businesses.

468
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,420
我们要鼓励白手起家的企业家们
You've got to encourage self-starting entrepreneurs

469
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,520
经营新企业
to start new ventures,

470
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,520
-雇佣员工  -具体地
- hire employees... - But specifically,

471
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,030
-关于流域法案  -小公司
- about the watershed act... - Small businesses,

472
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,460
才是解决之道  其他都是在装门面
that's the solution. Everything else is window dressing.

473
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,740
非常感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

474
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,030
谢谢
Thank you.

475
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,860
晚安  副总统先生
Good night, Mr. Vice-President.

476
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,460
你好
Hello.

477
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,160
我想谈谈马修斯
I need to talk about Matthews.

478
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,740
没错  我看过新闻报道了
Yes. I read the press reports.

479
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,560
他没帮上什么忙  是吗
He's not being very helpful, is he?

480
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,150
他害多利少
He's doing more harm than good.

481
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,230
我想让他离开
I want to ask him to leave.

482
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,890
那说出去可不好听
Well, that wouldn't make for a very good story.

483
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,060
那也比让他毁了整个巡回竞选强
It's better than him torpedoing the whole bus tour.

484
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,300
你有和他谈过吗
Have you tried to talk to him?

485
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,840
还没  我想先征求你的意见
No, I wanted to ask your advice first.

486
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,400
也许有办法
Well, maybe there's a way

487
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,240
能不赶他走又让他支持你
to keep him on the tour and inspire his support.

488
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,000
我们的观点存在本质差异
We have fundamentally different views.

489
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
你无法改变他的观念
Well, look, you're not going to be able change his ideology,

490
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,590
触动他的心
but dig deeper.

491
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,430
吉姆是个骄傲的人  从骄傲下手
Jim is a proud man. Tap into that pride.

492
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,090
我只想他走人
I just wish he was gone.

493
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,910
做你觉得最合适的事
Well, you do whatever you think best.

494
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,270
但无论决定怎样
But whatever it is you decide,

495
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,470
一定要坚守自己的立场
be firm and stand up for yourself.

496
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,070
至少他会对此有所回应
He'll respond to that at least.

497
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,740
还有需要  再给我打电话
And call me back if you need anything.

498
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,980
他给的理由是什么  你闯祸了吗
What was the reason he gave you? Were you messing up?

499
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,530
没有  领班说我做得很好
No. The head waiter said I was doing a really good job.

500
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,300
他第二天甚至开始让我独自负责餐桌
He even started letting me take my own tables on the second day.

501
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,970
那就是经理  他叫什么
And then the manager... what's his name?

502
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,290
里昂
Leon.

503
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,500
他调戏你了
He propositioned you?

504
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,560
他叫我去他办公室
Called me into his office,

505
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,420
说不能再雇新员工了  甚至是兼职的
said couldn't afford to start taking anyone new on, even part-time.

506
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,530
他把手放在我的膝盖上  说可以有例外
Put his hand on my knee, said he might be able to make an exception.

507
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,470
然后他的手滑向了我的大腿
So he started sliding his hand up my thigh.

508
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,800
我站起来说要回去工作
So I stood up and I tell him I should get back to work.

509
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,050
他说"留下"  解开了自己的皮带
He says, "Stay." He unbuckled his belt.

510
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,160
你做了吗
Did you?

511
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,910
没有  我走出办公室  回去工作
No, I walked out of the office and got back to my tables.

512
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,300
第二天去上班时  他要我回家
Next day, I came into work, told me to go home.

513
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,560
我被辞退了
I was fired.

514
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,990
告诉我餐馆的名字
Tell me the name of the restaurant.

515
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,300
你回家好早
You're home early.

516
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,630
我需要休息下
I needed a breather.

517
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,980
今早我都没吃早饭
I didn't have breakfast this morning.

518
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,370
我过会儿可能还要回去
I might head back in a little while.

519
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,520
投票算得如何
The vote count?

520
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,420
这次得最后才见分晓了
It's going to come down to the wire on this one.

521
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,160
我今天和凯瑟琳・杜兰特谈过了
I spoke to Catherine Durant today.

522
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,970
她无法将那批货运出南苏丹
She's unable to get the shipment out of South Sudan.

523
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,750
是的  我们要断绝一切邦交
Yeah, we're cutting all diplomatic ties.

524
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,820
外事委员会对这事很恼火
Foreign Affairs is up in arms about it.

525
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,530
对  据她说  因此她毫无办法
Yes. Which is why she can't lift a finger, according to her.

526
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,490
总之她是这么说的  你得去和她谈谈
It's what she said anyway. Anyway, I need you to talk to her.

527
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,170
我看那样也没什么用
I don't think that would make any difference.

528
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,890
她不是欠我们的吗  弗兰西斯
I thought she owed us, Francis.

529
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,830
确实  但她能力有限
She does, but there's limits.

530
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,610
她是国务卿
She's Secretary of State.

531
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,220
不能违反外交协议
She can't break diplomatic protocol.

532
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,540
那你能打几个电话吗
Well, can you make some calls?

533
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,650
如果她做不到  我也没办法
If she can't, I can't.

534
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,730
再说我得集中精力在流域法案上
Plus I have to focus on the watershed bill.

535
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,970
我都抽时间来帮你弄法案了
I'm taking time out of my schedule to help you with that.

536
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,220
-因为是你起草的  -因为是你要求的
- Because you drafted it. - Because you asked me.

537
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,120
我不想做这事
I didn't want to do this.

538
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,040
我只求你也能抽一点时间帮我
All I'm asking is that you give me a little bit of your time in return.

539
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,340
我要如何解决一个我无力解决的问题
And how am I supposed to fix a problem I can't fix?

540
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,360
雷米怎么样
What about Remy?

541
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,260
格兰顿-希尔在南苏丹一定有联系人
Glendon Hill must have contacts in South Sudan.

542
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,010
他在投票的事上和我们作对
He's fighting us on the vote.

543
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,220
那完全是两码事
Those are two completely separate issues.

544
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,950
根本就是一回事
They are not.

545
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,450
他帮了你的忙  马上就会来要挟我
He does you a favor, he hangs it over me.

546
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,010
你的意思是我的目标在你的之下吗
So what you're saying is my goals are secondary to yours.

547
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,110
我不是那个意思
That is not what I'm saying.

548
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,620
我觉得根本是你拉不下脸来
I think you don't want to go hat in hand

549
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,190
求你的老部下帮忙
to somebody who used to work for you.

550
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,280
你别一进门就教训我
I will not be lectured to the moment you walk in the door!

551
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,340
我说话算话  给凯瑟琳打了电话
I called Catherine, as promised!

552
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,430
她做不到根本和我毫无关系
Her inability to deliver is not my problem or my fault!

553
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,870
我又控制不了全球格局的改变
I cannot control changing global landscapes!

554
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,760
更不会受迫许下无法履行的诺言
And I will not be cornered into making promises I cannot deliver!

555
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,000
抱歉我冲你发火了
I am sorry I yelled.

556
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,580
我压力很大
I'm under a lot of pressure.

557
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,620
你说得对  是我没想清楚
You're right, I didn't think it through.

558
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,470
我现在真的不能去求雷米
I just can't go to Remy right now.

559
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,890
他已经拉拢了太多我的人
He's poaching too many of my people.

560
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,810
还有两位国会议员
I've got two congressmen

561
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,890
仍然举棋不定
who will not commit.

562
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,430
我本来还指望你能跟他们谈谈
I was hoping you might speak to them.

563
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,250
都是谁
Who?

564
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,660
范德博格和艾布拉姆斯
Vanderburgh and Abrams.

565
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,470
你想让我跟他们说什么
What is it that you want me to say to them?

566
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,370
他们很重视环保
They're big on the environment.

567
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,830
他们觉得那项法案没多大用处
They don't think the bill goes far enough.

568
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,240
他们尊重你的意见
They respect your opinion.

569
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,950
我希望你能逐条讲解一下法案
I wanted you to walk them through the bill step-by-step.

570
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,290
让他们放心  我得说服他们投赞成票
Put them at ease. I need to get them in the yes column.

571
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,390
明天我先跟他们碰面  敲打敲打他们
I meet with them tomorrow. I'll deliver the bruises.

572
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,160
之后你再去安抚一下
You meet with them later and patch them up.

573
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,850
软硬兼施估计能管用
That might just do the trick.

574
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,330
没问题
Of course.

575
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,510
我好像把碗打碎了
I think I broke the bowl.

576
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,670
我们因为石油交易和那边有联系
We have contacts there through our oil interest.

577
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,040
我需要政府的干预
I'm going to need government intervention.

578
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,070
有政府的地方我们就有人脉
Wherever there's a government, we know people.

579
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,670
哪怕只是个不成形政府
Even when there's only the illusion of a government.

580
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,630
你会帮我吗
Will you help me?

581
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,280
我很愿意
I'd like to.

582
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,530
但办这么大事  可是要花钱的
But for something like this, I'm afraid there's a price tag.

583
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,120
净水计划会为桑科做环保认证
The C.W.I. will endorse Sancorp as eco-friendly.

584
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,860
他们可以在任何公关和营销材料上
They can use our logo on any PR

585
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,790
使用我们的标志
or marketing materials you want.

586
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,300
这可不够
We'll need more than that.

587
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,410
他们之前肯为这些捐一百多万
They were willing to donate over a million for that.

588
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,000
那些滤水器只有二十万
These filters are only worth $200,000.

589
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,200
这已经很划算了
I'd say that's a bargain.

590
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,450
可你拒绝了那笔钱
You turned down that offer.

591
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,550
现在形势已经不同了
Landscape has shifted since then.

592
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,800
-流域法案  -没错
- The watershed bill? - That's right.

593
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,480
你要我修改法案吗
You want it amended?

594
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,910
我要你让法案流产
I want you to kill it, the whole thing.

595
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,020
净水计划已经公开支持这项法案了  雷米
C.W.I. has publicly backed the bill, Remy.

596
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,770
明面上的事我不管
What you do publicly is your concern.

597
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,200
先生们  请坐
Gentlemen. Please, have a seat.

598
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,220
我们上次谈话之后你们改主意了吗
So have either of you changed your mind since we last spoke?

599
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,780
我们还没拿定主意  弗兰克
We're still undecided, Frank.

600
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,700
倾向赞成还是反对呢
Leaning one way or the other?

601
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,950
如果国会要注资2.5亿美元
If congress is going to allocate a quarter billion dollars,

602
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,260
我们希望这笔钱能投到
we want to make sure it goes towards a

603
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,420
更有利于环保的...
bill that does more to protect the...

604
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,450
这些我们都谈过了  我了解你们的顾虑
We've been through all that. I know your concerns.

605
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,470
所以如果法案的环保措施不能提高
So if the protection standards don't change,

606
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,860
我们更希望把钱花在更有效的举措上
we would rather see that money spent more effectively elsewhere.

607
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,580
那就是说你们都倾向于反对了
That sounds like you're both leaning no.

608
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,660
我们的要求一直非常明确
We've been very clear about what we're asking.

609
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,420
好吧
Okay.

610
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,620
这个是你  艾布拉姆斯
This is you, Abrams.

611
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,670
这个是你  范德博格
And this is you, Vanderburgh.

612
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,000
这边
And over here...

613
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,550
是大多数民主党成员
is the majority of the Democratic caucus.

614
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,870
你们就站在那边孤军奋战
See, you're over there all by your lonesome.

615
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,100
你们并不介意做害群之马
Now, you don't mind being the black sheep.

616
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,970
你们是左派中的左派
You're the liberal wing of the liberal wing.

617
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,800
多数时候你们怎么投票都行
Most of the time you can vote what you want,

618
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,330
反正法案总能获得通过
we still pass things anyway.

619
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,880
但这次
But this time

620
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,520
你们的票很重要
it does matter.

621
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,810
而你们两个没有考虑到的
And what the two of you aren't taking into account

622
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,760
是处在桌子这端和这端之间的
is between this end of the desk and this end of the desk...

623
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,820
是我
is me.

624
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,080
下面我要说其他曾坐在这里的议员
Now, I'm going to say to you what I say to every congressman

625
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,550
也听我说过的话
that sits where you're sitting now.

626
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,310
投票要顾及你的选区  凭良心
Vote your district. Vote your conscience.

627
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
别让我措手不及
Don't surprise me.

628
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,280
而其中最重要的一点
And the most important one of those...

629
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,650
就是别让我措手不及
is don't surprise me.

630
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,870
你们俩明天要和我妻子会面
Now, you're both to meet with my wife tomorrow.

631
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,990
你们要洗耳恭听
And you're to hear her out.

632
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,350
她会逐项解答你们的顾虑
She will go through your concerns point-by-point.

633
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,380
我敢保证  之后
And I am certain after that

634
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,090
你们会做出正确的决定
that the two of you will make the right decision.

635
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,050
你们该走了
This is the part where you leave.

636
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
我常发现流血的心[悲天悯人者]
I have often found that bleeding hearts

637
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,630
反而很害怕流血
have a ironic fear of their own blood.

638
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,640
流一滴就会罢工
One drop and they seize up.

639
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,290
不过只要伸出关爱之手  将它按摩复苏
But offer them a caring hand and massage them back to life

640
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,400
它就能很快跳动正确的节奏
and they soon start beating to the right drum.

641
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,320
喂
Hello.

642
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,160
我刚跟艾布拉姆斯和范德博格谈过了
I've just spoken to Abrams and Vanderburgh.

643
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,570
就让他们今晚辗转反侧去吧
Let them toss and turn tonight,

644
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,570
明天就看你的了
but they're all yours tomorrow.

645
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,250
我会联络他们的办公室  约个时间
I'll reach out to their offices and set a time.

646
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,540
谢谢你  克莱尔
Thank you, Claire.

647
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,340
应该的  能帮上忙就好
Of course. Whatever I can do to help.

648
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,450
您点的餐  先生  请慢用
Here you go, sir. Enjoy.

649
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,300
不好意思
Excuse me.

650
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,200
牛排上有根头发
There's a hair on my steak.

651
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,220
真抱歉  先生  在哪里
I am so sorry, sir. Where?

652
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,110
就在这儿
Right there.

653
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,990
我没看到
I don't see it.

654
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,300
你是说我没长眼睛吗
Are you telling me I'm blind?

655
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,580
不是  先生  真对不起
No, sir. I'm so sorry.

656
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,930
-我让厨师...  -你叫什么
- I'll have the kitchen... - What's your name?

657
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,720
斯蒂芬妮
Stephanie.

658
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,130
盘子就放这儿  斯蒂芬妮
You can leave the plate, Stephanie.

659
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,620
我想和你们经理谈谈
I'd like to talk to the manager.

660
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,480
好的  先生  我去叫他
Yes, sir. I'll go get him.

661
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,620
谢谢
Thank you.

662
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,920
晚上好  先生
Good evening, sir.

663
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,590
斯蒂芬妮说您的餐盘里有根头发
Uh, Stephanie tells me there was a hair on your plate.

664
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,140
没有
No.

665
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,280
没有头发
There wasn't any hair.

666
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,090
你叫里昂对吧
Leon, right? That's your name?

667
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,490
是的
Yes.

668
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,940
斯蒂芬妮这小妞很辣是吧
Stephanie is a hot little number, isn't she?

669
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,960
屁股真翘
Nice ass.

670
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,210
你逼她给你吹箫是你雇她之前还是之后
Did you make her blow you before or after you hired her?

671
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,280
先生  请你出去
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

672
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,220
-坐下  里昂  -先生  请出去
- Sit down, Leon. - Sir, I want you to go.

673
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,430
-我说了  坐下  -别逼我报警
- I said sit. - Don't make me call the police.

674
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,070
听好了  你要是报警
I'll tell you what. You call the police,

675
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,680
我就向移民局举报
I'll call the department of immigration

676
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,270
你厨房里那四个
about the four undocumented employees

677
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,440
非法移民的雇员
you have working in the kitchen.

678
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,270
这是重罪  里昂
Felony, Leon.

679
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,210
我可能还会提及
And I might also mention

680
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,520
你的女友  她母亲和姨妈
your girlfriend, her mother, and her aunt

681
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,900
也是非法移民
who also undocumented and

682
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,650
而且你为她们支付房租
living in an apartment that you pay for.

683
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,620
你进监狱
Prison time for you,

684
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,100
她们被驱逐出境
deportation for them.

685
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,700
不怎么好  对不对
Not a pretty picture, is it?

686
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,640
我们来谈谈瑞秋・波斯纳
Let's talk about Rachel Posner.

687
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,400
票数多接近
How close is it?

688
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,200
今天应该能敲定最后两票
I should have the last two votes I need committed today.

689
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,370
我只需确保没人反悔
I just want to make sure no one changes their mind.

690
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,990
我现在不能
I'd prefer not to

691
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,080
卷入环境问题之中
get embroiled in environmental issues at this time.

692
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,320
但这个方案也能促进就业
But it's also a jobs-creation package.

693
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,230
它不利于石油和天然气的发展
It's antagonizing oil and gas.

694
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,650
教改法案耗资巨大
We can't afford that sort of battle

695
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,430
政府无力再为这场斗争买单
after all the capital we spent on education.

696
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,360
只要政府公开表示支持就行
All I need is one public statement of support.

697
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,630
我不行  不然让琳达明天去帮你吧
I won't do that. How about you take Linda tomorrow?

698
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,240
把她安排在你办公室
You set her up in your offices.

699
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,960
所有拉票会议和电话
Any meetings or calls you might need to whip up votes,

700
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,990
都交给她办
you got her there.

701
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,270
我没法一整天在国会拉票
Well, I can't afford to spend a whole day lobbying on the Hill.

702
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,410
你有助理
Well, you got deputies.

703
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,140
的确是有
Yes, I do.

704
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,710
你是说隔了十个街区就指挥不动他们了吗
Well, you're telling me you can't manage them from ten blocks away?

705
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,990
当然可以  先生
Of course I can, sir.

706
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,020
-如果实在不方便  -不会不会
- Look, if it's too difficult... - No, no, no.

707
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,330
我们帮你  弗兰克
We'll help you out, Frank.

708
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,280
对不对  琳达
Won't we, Linda?

709
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,010
是的  先失陪
Yes. If you'll just excuse me,

710
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,000
我要去调整下行程
I have a few things to rearrange on my schedule.

711
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,370
还有呢  弗兰克
What else, Frank?

712
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,810
说说博奇在计划什么
Tell me what Birch is up to.

713
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,400
我知道我取消两次了
No, I know I've already canceled twice.

714
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,810
下周开始
They start next week.

715
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,760
宝贝  我在想办法
Sweetie, I'm trying to figure this out.

716
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,310
-琳达  -稍等
- Linda. - Excuse me.

717
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,710
-怎么了  -谢谢你同意帮忙
- Yes? - Just wanted thank you for agreeing to pitch in,

718
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,940
我知道你事务繁忙
I know you have a full plate.

719
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,020
应该的  弗兰克
Of course, Frank.

720
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,670
一切还好吗  听起来...
Is everything all right? It sounds like...

721
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,990
没事  我明天什么时候去
Yes. What time do you want me to come by tomorrow?

722
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,810
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

723
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,980
我等会儿再打给你行吗
Can I just call you back in one second?

724
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,380
我打给你  没错
I will call you. Yes.

725
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,320
琳达  很抱歉总统为难你了
Linda, I am so sorry that the president has forced you into this.

726
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
这不是我的本意
It was not my intention.

727
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,030
如果你愿意  我可以给国会...
If you would like, I can talk to congress...

728
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,030
不  不是这个问题
No, it's not that.

729
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,360
是我个人的问题  不用担心
It's... It's a personal matter. Don't worry.

730
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,030
什么问题  或许我能帮忙
Well, what is it? Maybe I can help.

731
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,740
就是...我儿子没考上斯坦福大学
Just... my son didn't get into Stanford.

732
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,060
我明天本来要和教务长会面
I was supposed to meet with the Provost tomorrow

733
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,940
看能不能说服他改变想法
to see if I could get him to change his mind.

734
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,260
我向总统请示过了
I asked the president if I could go,

735
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,050
他都同意了  一定是忘了
and he said yes, but he must have forgotten.

736
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,230
你去吧  总统会理解的
You should go. I'm sure the president will understand.

737
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,110
不行  我不会
No, no. I don't let

738
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,110
因为私人问题影响工作  弗兰克
personal matters get in the way of my job, Frank.

739
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,310
琳达  你不能把生活都晾在一边
Linda, you can't put your entire life on hold.

740
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,360
尤其不能耽误自己的儿子
And certainly not at the expense of your own son.

741
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,550
我已经耽误他了
Well, it has been at the expense of my son.

742
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,080
他落榜是我造成的
It's my fault he didn't get in.

743
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,680
我忙着竞选的事  没空陪他
I was on the campaign and I wasn't there for him.

744
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,560
他的成绩受了影响  申请也...
His grades suffered. His application was...

745
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,790
我没照顾好他  弗兰克
I wasn't there, Frank.

746
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,320
但我想  如果可以
But I figured if I could just

747
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,160
和教务长当面谈谈...
meet with the Provost face to face...

748
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,180
行了  你明天去斯坦福大学
Okay, look, you're going to Stanford tomorrow.

749
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,130
如果你去了我办公室
If you show up at my office,

750
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,880
我不会让你进门  所以想都别想
I won't let you in, so don't even consider it.

751
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,650
弗兰克  总统让我...
Frank, the president wants me to be...

752
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,200
不用告诉他
He doesn't have to know.

753
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,580
我找个排程员给你订张机票
I'm going to have one of my schedulers buy you a ticket.

754
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,260
法案会顺利通过的
The bill will be fine.

755
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
弗兰克
Frank.

756
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,790
你不必这样
You don't have to do this.

757
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,910
我们虽有分歧  琳达
We may have our disagreements, Linda,

758
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,560
但不代表我们不能互相照应
but that doesn't mean we can't look out for each other.

759
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,850
告诉孩子你会过去
You tell them you're coming.

760
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,100
试音  试音
Test, test, test.

761
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,500
佐伊  我是纽约转播中心的高级制片戴夫
All right, Zoe. This is Dave, the senior producer in New York.

762
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,490
-4分钟后开始直播  -很好
- We'll go live in four minutes. - Sounds good.

763
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,340
第一个话题是国会
The first topic will be the congressional

764
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,490
秋季会议的议程
agenda for the fall session,

765
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,750
然后聊聊中期预测  最后聚焦到
then we'll move on to the midterms, then we'll wrap it up

766
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,020
彼得・罗素的州长竞选和流域法案
with Peter Russo's race for Governor and his watershed bill.

767
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,840
好的  
Okay, great.

768
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,630
我现在关掉你的麦  剩30秒时回来
Taking you off mic until 30 out.

769
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,570
简宁  我得说流域法案的事
Hey, Janine, I have to talk about the watershed bill.

770
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,970
-你有提纲吗  -有  稍等
- Do you have a one-sheet? - Uh, yeah. Hold on.

771
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,460
多谢
Thanks.

772
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,080
计票有消息吗
Any word on the vote count?

773
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,050
没有  我给所有民主党议员都打了电话
Still no luck. I've called every democrat in the house

774
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,250
希望能拼凑出个数字  但没人回应
to cobble together a number, but no one's getting back to me.

775
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,290
那我能说什么
So what can I say?

776
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,120
不确定因素很多  票数胶着
That there's a lot in flux, and it'll be tight.

777
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,540
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

778
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,180
应该的
Yeah. Sure thing.

779
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,240
弗朗西斯  是我
Hey, Francis, it's me.

780
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,190
回我电话
Call me back.

781
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,160
进来
Yes.

782
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,800
罗素议员急着见您
Congressman Russo. He says it's urgent.

783
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
好吧
Fine.

784
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,930
早上好  先生
Good morning, sir.

785
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,160
我想聊聊巡回竞选的事
I'd like to talk about how the tour's going.

786
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,450
去车上聊吧  11点不是有活动吗
Well, let's talk on the bus. Don't we have an event at 11:00?

787
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,220
如果不聊清楚  就没必要做活动了
There won't be any events until we talk.

788
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,720
你一直在抢话
You're hijacking the microphone.

789
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,710
你反对我说的一切
You're contradicting everything I say.

790
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,560
我们得推动流域法案
We need to be promoting the watershed act.

791
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,570
我欣赏你的直率
Well, I appreciate your being so forthright.

792
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,950
告诉你我不欣赏什么吧
Let me tell you what I don't appreciate.

793
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,950
民主党委员会让一个毫无经验的瘾君子
The D.N.C. is running a man with zero track record,

794
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,870
参加竞选  接替我的位置
except for substance abuse, to fill my shoes.

795
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,160
我知道你不想来  先生
I realize you don't want to be here, sir,

796
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,930
但现在看来你在故意破坏我的竞选
but it seems like you're deliberately trying to sabotage my campaign.

797
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,780
尽管有违意愿  我是想挽救它
Despite my better judgment, I'm trying to save it.

798
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,170
我比你了解这州的人  彼得
I know the people of this state better than you, Peter.

799
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,510
他们不想听什么流域
They don't want to hear about watersheds.

800
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,810
他们想听工作的事
They want to hear about jobs.

801
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,110
这周他们两者都得听
Well, this week, they need to hear both.

802
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,020
那我也许该闭嘴站在你旁边
Well, then, maybe I should just stand quietly beside you at the podium

803
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,860
看着你输掉
and watch you lose.

804
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,960
-你觉得我赢不了  是吗  -我不看好
- You don't think I can win, do you? - I'm not optimistic.

805
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,480
你前两次竞选州长都输了
You lost the first two times you ran for Governor.

806
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,870
第三次  没人觉得你有机会
The third time, nobody thought you had a chance.

807
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,430
9月  你落后15个百分点
By September, you were 15 points down.

808
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,290
竞选资金不足
You were out of money.

809
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,510
只得抵押房子贷款
You had to mortgage your own house

810
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,780
来支付员工薪水
just to keep your staff on payroll.

811
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,630
我知道我干了什么  我在场
I'm well aware of what I did. I was there.

812
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,120
我要说的是你并没气馁
My point is you kept going.

813
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,750
你不到20天内走访了67个郡
You hit 67 counties in less than 20 days,

814
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,310
证明所有人都错了
and you proved everyone wrong.

815
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,970
不管你是否看好  这次是我竞选
Like it or not, it's my name on the ticket this time,

816
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,670
我有这个机会  我要证明别人都错了
and I got the shot, and I'm gonna prove everyone wrong.

817
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,930
也包括你  先生  正如你当年
Just like you did. Including you, sir.

818
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,580
我希望你支持我  你不肯也没关系
I would like your support, but if you won't give it, fine.

819
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,610
那也阻止不了我
It won't stop me.

820
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,450
你觉得我来这里容易吗
You think it's easy for me to be here?

821
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,570
我卸任州长时正值全盛时期
I left the Governor's mansion right in my prime.

822
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,480
我去做了副总统
To be what? Vice president.

823
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,160
我以为那是升了一步  但知道吗
I thought that was a step up. But you know what?

824
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,580
我一丁点影响力都没有
I don't have a fucking shred of real influence.

825
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,310
我就像个吉祥物一样到处晃悠
I'm trotted around like a goddamn mascot,

826
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,670
这还是我家乡呢
and this is my home state.

827
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,390
我在给你影响力  先生
I'm offering you influence, sir.

828
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,130
我需要你的指导和专业意见
I'd like your guidance and your expertise.

829
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,070
但如果你不愿提供  那么...
But if that's not on the table, then, well...

830
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,020
恕我直言  副总统先生
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President,

831
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,880
你还是回华盛顿吧
you should head back to Washington.

832
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,270
你丈夫说得很清楚
Your husband was very explicit.

833
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,930
我觉得那是威胁
I would categorize it as a threat.

834
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,310
-他说了什么  -别让他措手不及
- What did he say exactly? - Not to surprise him.

835
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,000
他还让你们
Didn't he also tell you

836
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,920
顾及选区  凭良心了吗
to vote your district and your conscience?

837
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,390
他说了  但那个似乎不那么重要
He did, but those seemed far lower on his priority list.

838
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,970
如果你们有强烈理由
Well, he would never fault you

839
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,810
做自己认为该做的事  他不会怪你们的
if you had a compelling reason to do what you think is right.

840
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,410
我糊涂了  你不是支持法案的吗
I'm confused. Aren't you for this bill?

841
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,050
净水计划公开支持它
C.W.I. Is publicly for it.

842
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,430
就我个人而言  也有同样的疑虑
Privately, I have my doubts for the same reasons you do.

843
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,140
我以为
I was under the impression

844
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,840
我们来是为让你说服我们投赞成票
that we were here so you could persuade us to vote yes.

845
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,780
我没想说服你们做任何事
Oh, I'm not trying to persuade you of anything.

846
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,530
我要说
I will say this:

847
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,270
即使法案不通过也不是世界末日
if the bill fails, it's not the end of the world.

848
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,560
我们随时可以发起新法案
We can always sponsor new legislation.

849
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,960
有更严格的管理标准的法案
You know, something with stricter regulatory standards.

850
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,300
我要问明白  你是说
Just to be clear, you're telling us

851
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,470
你不介意我们投反对票
you don't mind if we vote against the bill.

852
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,670
我只是在说我丈夫会说的
I'm simply saying what my husband would...

853
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,060
投票要凭良心
that you should vote your conscience.

854
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,690
-情况如何  -缺一票
- How are we looking? - We're short a vote.

855
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,700
我刚接到克莱尔的电话
I just got off the phone with Claire.

856
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,470
范德博格和艾布拉姆斯被说服了
Vanderburgh and Abrams are on board.

857
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,380
-确定赞成票吗  -确定
- Those are definite yeses? - Definite.

858
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,730
那就没问题了
We should be good.

859
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,470
怎么了
Yes?

860
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,170
我从昨天就一直在找你了
I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.

861
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,230
我一直在忙着计票
Well, I've been a bit busy counting votes.

862
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,840
你说会给我个数字
You said you'd have a number for me.

863
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,490
你该试试打给我的新闻办公室
Well, you should try my press office.

864
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,060
我试了  但没人回电话
I did. They won't return my calls.

865
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,370
官方说法是票数胶着
Well, the official word is it will be close.

866
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,060
我想知道非官方说法
I'm trying to get the unofficial word.

867
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,130
我现在不能有所偏袒  对吧
Oh, I can't appear to be playing favorites now, can I?

868
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,660
这不是因为那天的事吧
This isn't because of the other day, is it?

869
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,890
哪天的事
What other day?

870
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,810
你说我们可以保持公事往来
You said we'd keep our professional relationship.

871
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,400
公事公办就是这样
Well, this is what professional feels like.

872
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,120
有请美利坚合众国副总统  吉姆・马修斯
The vice president of the United States, Jim Matthews!

873
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,250
谢谢
Thank you.

874
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,260
回到布里斯托感觉真好
It's good to be back in Bristol.

875
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,160
加油  勇士们
Go, warriors!

876
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,980
你们都知道我是个话痨
Now, you all know me. I'm a windbag.

877
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,540
我可以一直说到你们睡着
I can go on until you all fall asleep,

878
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,780
睡八个小时
get eight hours of shut-eye,

879
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,790
醒来后发现我还在说个不停
and wake up to find me still yapping.

880
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,750
对于我左边这位年轻人  我有很多话可说
And there's a lot I could say about this young man to my left.

881
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,030
其实  我对他和他的理念  他的过去
The truth is, I've had a lot of doubts about him and his ideas,

882
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,810
他的年轻时代都多有质疑
about his past, about his youth.

883
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,600
但如果你们还记得
But if you'll remember,

884
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,670
我第一次竞选时你们中许多人也都质疑我
a lot of you had doubts about me the first time I ran.

885
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,620
第二次  第三次也是
And the second and the third.

886
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,720
但在过去这几天
But over the last few days,

887
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,860
和彼得一起在宾州巡回竞选
traveling around the state with Peter,

888
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,620
我必须承认  他征服了我
I have to admit he's won me over.

889
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,040
他很聪明  有活力
He's smart, he's energetic,

890
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,150
最重要的是  他是个斗士
and, most important, he's a fighter.

891
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,900
那辆巴士上写着"崭新的开始"
Now, it says "A fresh start" On that bus over there.

892
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,890
这是真的
And that's the real truth,

893
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,350
因为这位年轻人会带给我们州
because this young man will give our state

894
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,860
一个它亟需的崭新开始
the fresh start it so desperately needs.

895
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,540
女士们先生们  有请下届宾州州长
Ladies and gentlemen, the next Governor of Pennsylvania,

896
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,790
彼得・罗素
Peter Russo.

897
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,600
谢谢  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

898
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,130
布里斯托你好吗
How's it going, Bristol?

899
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,860
今天我想与你们谈谈经济复苏
Today I'd like to talk to you about economic recovery.

900
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,350
你们很多人都知道
Now, as many of you may be aware,

901
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,410
多亏我的对手花了几百万
mostly because my opponent feels the need

902
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,120
在电视上宣传我的过去
to spend millions of dollars on TV ads about my past,

903
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,880
我对复苏也略知一二
I know a thing or two about recovery.

904
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,770
我在自己的斗争过程中学到了很多
I've learned a great deal through my personal struggles.

905
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,580
我学会了如何利用我的力量和决心
I've learned how to harness my strength and my resolve,

906
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,370
为我效力
make them work for me,

907
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,810
如同多年前  布里斯托的水磨
much the way your Bristol watermills harnessed the power

908
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,570
利用美丽的水獭湾
of your beautiful Otter Creek

909
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,120
和澎湃的特拉华河一样
and the mighty Delaware river years ago.

910
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,970
让我告诉你们特拉华河
Let me tell you how the Delaware river

911
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,440
将如何在接下来几年中重振经济
will reinvigorate your economy for years to come!

912
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,710
苏丹的货物要放行了
We're going to get the shipment out of Sudan.

913
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,560
-太棒了  -大概要几周时间
- That's great. - It might take a few weeks,

914
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,000
但你该开始安排博茨瓦纳的工作了
but I think you should start making arrangements for Botswana,

915
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,310
你要在那里建大本营和仓库
where you're gonna set up base camp and the depot.

916
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,590
写完预算后尽快给我
Just send me a budget as soon as you've got one.

917
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,580
克莱尔  能派别人替我去吗
Claire, is there any way we can send someone in my place?

918
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,210
我以为你想亲自去
I thought you wanted to be on the ground.

919
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,080
我想去  但现在不行
I would, but I can't this time.

920
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,200
为什么
Why not?

921
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,120
我不知道该怎么告诉你
I wasn't sure how to tell you this,

922
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,550
但我怀孕12周了
but I passed the 12-week mark.

923
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,730
你怀孕了
You're expecting.

924
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,000
吉莉安  太棒了  那
Gillian, that's wonderful. That...

925
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,230
什么时候的事  谁是孩子父亲
When did this happen? Who's the father?

926
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,550
我在国外认识的一位无国界医生
There was this guy I met overseas. Doctors without borders.

927
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,880
我们在一起过  后来我走了
We had this thing. Then I left.

928
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,360
但他几个月前回了美国
But he came back to the states a few months ago,

929
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,880
就是那时的事
and that's when it happened.

930
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,280
结果不是很好  但我想要这孩子
Anyway, it didn't end well. But I want to keep the baby.

931
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,570
-他知道吗  -他结婚了
- And does he know? - He's married.

932
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,780
我不该这样  很傻
I shouldn't have. It was stupid.

933
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,160
不必解释
You don't have to explain.

934
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,270
我三月初得请几天假
I'll need some time off at the beginning of march.

935
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,270
没问题
Of course.

936
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,430
我们会派别人去的
And absolutely, we'll send someone else instead.

937
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,350
非常感谢  克莱尔
I appreciate it, Claire.

938
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,820
应该的
Sure.

939
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,870
你要三分熟是吗
You said medium-rare?

940
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,060
有什么需要尽管告诉我
Just, uh, let me know if you guys need anything.

941
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,640
你猜这是谁发来的短信
Who would you guess texted me just now?

942
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,470
我以为她能多坚持几天
I thought she'd last more than a couple days.

943
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,900
-出去吗  -一两个小时就回来
- Going somewhere? - Just for an hour or two.

944
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,920
还有个不肯合作的得去收拾
I got one last holdout to whip.

945
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,940
罗素的法案票数是多少
What's the vote count on Russo's bill?

946
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,110
你不先冲个澡
Oh, don't you wanna shower first

947
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,890
再谈事贬低自己吗
before we dirty ourselves with business?

948
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,710
你走了我再冲澡
I'll shower after you leave.

949
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,280
票数多少
What's the vote count?

950
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,270
你的语气让我不太想说
Your tone doesn't inspire me to be very forthcoming.

951
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,850
光上我还不够吗
Oh, the fuck wasn't enough?

952
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,240
还得要个特别的语气吗
You need a special tone too?

953
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,390
有人早上用酸刷牙了啊
Ooh, someone washed her mouth out with acid this morning.

954
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,460
不管你闹什么别扭
Whatever it is you're grappling with,

955
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,660
我真的毫无兴趣
I am sincerely not interested.

956
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,250
你比我老一倍
You're almost twice my age.

957
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,590
你说你不介意
You said that didn't bother you.

958
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,730
我撒谎了
I lied.

959
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:22,510
你有女儿的话  岁数都比我大了
If you had a daughter, she'd be older than me.

960
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,760
再过二十年  我还是比你现在要年轻
In 20 years, I'll still be younger than you are now.

961
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,350
我肯定辩不过基本的算数
Well, I can't argue with basic arithmetic.

962
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,010
你不觉得这很恶心吗
You don't find that disgusting?

963
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,550
我觉得你想让我这么想
I think you want me to.

964
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,830
但我一直把这当做
But I've never considered this any more or less

965
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,560
两个成年人之间两厢情愿的交易
than a transaction between two consenting adults.

966
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,900
如果你只想找一个帮你办事的女孩
If you just want the girl who will do your bidding for you,

967
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,050
你已经得到了
you already have that.

968
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,890
为什么上我
Why do you need to fuck me?

969
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,930
我要提醒你
I would remind you

970
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,940
是你先勾引的我
that it was you who initiated our affair,

971
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,320
是你去年冬天敲开我家的门
and it was you who came knocking at my door last winter.

972
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,260
也是我要求停止你我现在的关系
And it was me who asked that we stop what we're doing now.

973
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,460
我尊重了你的要求
Which I respected

974
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,670
直到你今晚打给我  要我过来
until you picked up a phone and asked me to come over tonight.

975
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,500
因为不这样你就什么都不给我
Because you wouldn't give me what I wanted unless I did.

976
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,750
告诉我  你为什么要这样
So tell me, why do you need this?

977
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,520
你似乎并不从中取乐
You don't seem to get any pleasure out of it.

978
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,890
我知道我肯定没有
I know I certainly don't.

979
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,650
我好像每次都能满足你
I seem to always leave you satisfied.

980
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,110
你怎么知道我不是装的
How do you know I'm not faking it?

981
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,630
你是吗
Are you?

982
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,050
这都看不出来不是更说明问题吗
Doesn't it say a lot that you can't tell?

983
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,900
我面对墙站着的时候你在想什么
What do you think about when I'm up against the wall?

984
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,180
一位伟人曾经说过
A great man once said

985
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,700
生活的一切都和性有关
that everything in life is about sex...

986
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,890
除了性本身
Except sex.

987
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,950
性关乎权力
Sex is about power.

988
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,570
你是要一个妓女
So you need a whore,

989
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,520
那你就是皮条客
which makes you a pimp.

990
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,010
我不是皮条客  只是一个非常慷慨的顾客
I'm not a pimp. Just a very generous John.

991
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,280
好  既然我们把关系理清楚了
Fine. As long as we're clear about what this is,

992
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,130
我可以扮演妓女的角色
I can play the whore.

993
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,050
付钱吧
Now pay me.

994
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,270
法案会通过的  我们有两票的优势
The bill will pass. We have it by two votes.

995
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,720
把这消息告诉你朋友斯克斯基小姐吧
You can pass that along to your friend, miss Skorsky.

996
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,360
如果她非得说这些才能安然入睡  那随她吧
If she must say such things in order to sleep at night, so be it.

997
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,740
我偶尔给她一点新闻就能换来她的忠诚
Her loyalty costs me nothing but the occasional crumb of news.

998
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,050
她的仇视对我完全无害
Her hatefulness takes no toll at all.

999
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,460
没人会去补偿一个妓女  只为稍后跟她温存
You don't compensate a working girl so you can cuddle after.

1000
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,710
最后一轮投票
Final voting...

1001
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,650
去了很多小镇  一些群众真的很棒
A lot of small towns, some really great crowds.

1002
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,640
也没有刹车失灵
No buses losing their brakes.

1003
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,300
别这样  你什么时候回去
Oh, please now. When do you head back?

1004
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,730
明天  我们想在投票后举行新闻发布会
Tomorrow. We wanna do a press conference when all the votes are in.

1005
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,060
-与会人员  请投票  -你没事吧
- Members, please cast your votes now. - Are you all right?

1006
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,530
我感觉有点恶心  会过去的  我没事
I'm just a little nauseous. It'll pass. I'm okay.

1007
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,710
-你说你预产期在3月  -3月14日
- You said you're due in March? - March 14th.

1008
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,230
真让人兴奋  晨吐严重吗
It's so exciting. How's the morning sickness?

1009
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,370
最困难的部分应该过去了
I think I'm over the hump.

1010
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,670
我总想上厕所  想要奇怪的东西
I have to pee all the time. Weird cravings.

1011
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,830
再做巡回竞选感觉很好  令人振作
It was good to be on the road again. Invigorating.

1012
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,120
我们内部计票的结果不错
Our internals are showing a nice bump in the numbers.

1013
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,560
你功不可没啊
You made a big difference.

1014
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,700
总统很感谢你  我也是
The president is grateful, and so am I.

1015
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,490
这是团队努力的成果
Well, it's a team effort, right?

1016
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,700
抱歉  我还没和你太太问好
Excuse me. I have yet to say hello to your better half.

1017
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,050
-斯坦福的事怎么样  -我觉得还不错
- How'd it go at Stanford? - Well, I think.

1018
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,450
校长是共和党人  所以没怎么寒暄
The Dean's a republican, so there was not a lot of small talk.

1019
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,380
但他似乎愿意考虑一下  下周就知道了
But he seemed open to considering it. We'll know more next week.

1020
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,760
-太好了  -感谢你帮我一把
- That's terrific. - I appreciate your helping me out.

1021
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,140
我什么都没做  谁都会订张机票
Oh, I didn't do anything. Anybody can book a plane ticket.

1022
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,740
不是这样的  你帮我打了掩护
That's not true. You covered for me.

1023
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,690
我们得去照顾那些重要的事
Well, we have to keep the important things in perspective, right?

1024
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,300
别以为这样我就欠你人情了

committee chairmanship
参议院和众议院都有各种下属负责不同工作的委员会
而各委员会的主席则由多数党成员出任
少数党成员最高只能作"ranking member"[副主席]
因此弗兰克动员民主党议员时
提醒他们如果重新划选区令民主党失去多数席位
他们也将相应失去各自在不同委员会中的主席位置

如果校长是董事长  教务长就是CEO  比副校长权力还要大
