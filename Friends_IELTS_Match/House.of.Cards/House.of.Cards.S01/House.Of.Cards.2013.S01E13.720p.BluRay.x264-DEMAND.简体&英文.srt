什么声音
What was that?

20
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,460
水龙头
The faucet.

21
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,490
滴个不停
It wouldn't shut up.

22
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,550
-你昨晚睡着了吗  -没有
- Did you sleep last night? - No.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,760
我会让南茜叫个水管工来
I'll call Nancy and tell her to call a plumber.

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,410
你能保证绝对谨慎吗
Absolute discretion. Can I count on that?

25
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,120
-当然  -雷蒙德・塔斯克
- Always. - Raymond Tusk.

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,640
总统想让他接任副总统
The President wants to tap him as the new V.P.

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,300
-你我必须阻止他  -为什么
- You and I cannot let that happen. - Why not?

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,500
因为他三分之一的资产投在核能上
Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,120
支持核能的商人进入白宫对桑科不利
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,410
反正市场正在转向天然气
The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,050
但塔斯克想拖住甚至扭转这个倾向
But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.

32
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,810
副总统没这么大的影响
Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.

33
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,700
他有  他和沃克关系很近
This one would. He and Walker are very close.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,510
桑科的市场地位下降
And it's in neither of our best interests

35
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,070
对我们都不是什么好事
to seep Sancorp's position in the marketplace diminished.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,910
你要我做什么
What's the ask?

37
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,230
如果塔斯克觉得自己的资产
Tusk won't accept the nomination

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,910
有危险就不会接受任命
if he thinks his holdings are at risk.

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,880
桑科需要发起一次恶意收购
Sancorp needs to initiate a hostile takeover.

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,680
他的资产顶三个桑科
He's worth three times what Sancorp is.

41
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,450
我是说那些子公司
I'm talking about the subsidiaries.

42
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,380
搞那些提炼  运输铀的公司就行
We go after the companies that refine and ship the uranium,

43
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,180
-辅助系统  -得了  弗兰克
- the support system that... - Come on, Frank.

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,140
要考虑到股东
There's stockholders to take into account,

45
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,610
巨大的财务风险
a huge financial exposure.

46
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,010
我们只需要让他分神
We just need to distract him.

47
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,980
象征性地比划两下  暗示一下还没完
Send a few token salvos and intimate there's more to come.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,960
我只要你和你的客户提一句
All I'm asking is that you speak to your client

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,030
看看他们有没有什么愿意考虑的办法
and see if this is something they might be willing to consider.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,770
总统周五就会宣布塔斯克的事
The President announces Tusk on Friday,

51
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,020
所以我们时间不多了
so we don't have a lot of time.

52
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,000
-我会打几个电话  -谢谢  雷米
- I'll make some calls. - Thank you, Remy.

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,230
他要是办不成  我就单枪匹马了
If he doesn't deliver, I'm an invader without an army.

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,790
他要是办成了  我还有点机会
If he does, I've got a fighting chance.

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,770
我只是觉得
I just didn't feel that

56
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,650
我们没法再积极地共事下去了
we could work together constructively any longer.

57
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,740
我觉得这是个正当理由
I think that's a perfectly legitimate reason...

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,890
当然是
Of course it is.

59
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,510
但你不能以怀孕为理由开除她
But what you can't do is fire someone for being pregnant.

60
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,660
她是这么说的吗
Is that what she's saying?

61
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,620
科尔女士声称你亲口说
Ms. Cole claims that you said,

62
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,200
我需要员工而不是母亲
quote, "I need employees, not mothers,"

63
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,240
还有  去照顾你的孩子吧
and, quote, "Go focus on your baby."

64
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,380
我能看一眼吗
Can I see that?

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,050
一派胡言  我
That's completely false. I...

66
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,980
-我从没说过这些  -她说你有
- I never said that. - She claims you did.

67
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,590
那就是对质了  对吗
It's her word against mine, right?

68
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,570
陪审团格外同情孕妇
Well, juries are very sympathetic with expecting mothers.

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,770
这是勒索
This is extortion.

70
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,830
我们不想上法庭  克莱尔
We don't want this going to trial, Claire.

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,770
你和你丈夫都是公众人物
You and your husband are public figures.

72
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,230
这会产生不利报道
This will result in some very bad press.

73
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,760
我建议跟他们庭外和解
I suggest we go back to them with a settlement offer.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,470
-我们需要逮捕记录  -没有啊
- We need the arrest record. - There isn't any.

75
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,130
-他们把他放了  -那我们得知道谁放了他
- They let him go. - Then we need to know who got him off.

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,960
如果安德伍德参与了的话
If Underwood was involved,

77
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,510
那就是滥用职权和腐败了
we are talking abuse of powers and corruption.

78
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,910
我查过了
I checked.

79
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,930
没有立案  没有存档照  什么也没有
There's no files, no mug shot, nothing.

80
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,260
那我们就得找拦车的警察
Then we need to find the cop who pulled him over,

81
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,060
或者看到他进警局的人
or somebody who saw him come into the station.

82
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,490
但是特区的警察  他们相互照顾
But D.C. Cops... they look after each other.

83
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,680
我们得小心点
We need to be careful.

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,690
你在警局有联络人吗
Do you have any sources on the force?

85
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,020
没有能在这种事上信得过的人
Not that I would trust with something like this.

86
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,960
卢卡斯当年是做犯罪版的
You know, Lucas started out on the crime beat.

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,510
我去问问他认识谁
I can see if he knows anyone.

88
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,160
-他会帮我们吗  -我不知道
- Would he help us? - I don't know.

89
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,590
-可能吧  -帮对手的忙
- Maybe. - Help out a competitor?

90
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,560
我们  一直有联系
We... stayed in touch.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
你逗我呢
You've gotta be kidding me.

92
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,130
这个世界真够乱的
This town is way too incestuous.

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,540
我知道这事很大
I know it's a lot to ask.

94
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,510
你跟弗兰克的事我还没想通呢  佐伊
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the affair, Zoe.

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,370
如果你能给我介绍个人再为我做担保
If you could just give me a contact and maybe vouch for me...

96
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,750
你是不是故意等到现在才说
Did you wait to bring this up until now

97
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,550
觉得我这会儿不好拒绝
because you thought it'd be harder for me to say no?

98
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,450
-什么意思  -在我们刚上过床...
- What do you mean? - In bed, right after we...

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,980
你真以为我会做那种...
You don't actually think I would do something like...

100
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,870
-看起来就是这样  -这是大事  卢卡斯
- It sure seems that way. - This is huge, Lucas.

101
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,670
我在极力避免毁掉我们之间的...
I'm trying to avoid fucking up what we have...

102
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,420
不论是什么  但你却让我很为难
Whatever that is... and you're making it really hard for me.

103
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,810
我恐怕永远都没法不让你为难
I don't know that I'll ever be the kind of person that makes it easy.

104
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,890
我不指望会简单
I'm not looking for easy.

105
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,740
但也别总让我想起他
But I don't need to be reminded of him.

106
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,580
-我没法改变过去  -我知道
- I can't erase what I did. - I know you can't.

107
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,850
但你这就是在摆布我
But this is really fucking manipulative.

108
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,300
你之前说的话是真心的吗
Did you mean what you said the other night?

109
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,390
你可能...
That you probably...

110
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,690
那种话让我不知所措
I don't know what to do when I hear something like that.

111
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,970
所以在去机场的路上才一言不发
That's why I was so quiet when you drove me to the airport.

112
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,850
我当时生气  冲口而出
I was angry. I just blurted it out.

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,760
我希望我没说  至少不要那么说
I wish I hadn't. At least not like that.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,690
我不是因为你说了那话而想利用你
I'm not trying to take advantage of you because you did.

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,730
-他什么也没说  -你也没问
- He hasn't said a word. - And you haven't brought it up?

116
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,970
我只问他是否还在考虑塔斯克
I just asked him if he was still considering Tusk.

117
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,240
他说是  但想先跟你谈谈
He said yes, but that he wanted to speak to you first. That's it.

118
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
真想知道他们聊过没
I wish we knew if they'd spoken at all.

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,440
他有专线  我没法追查
Well, he has a private line. I can't track those calls.

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,380
-弗兰克  -总统先生
- Frank. - Mr. President.

121
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,780
说说圣路易斯的情况吧
Tell me about St. Louis.

122
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,780
很难看出他在想什么  我尽力试探了
He's a hard man to read. I did my best to probe him,

123
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,590
但还是看不出他的倾向
but I don't think I left any wiser to which way he's leaning.

124
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,290
但我得说
I must say, though,

125
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,670
他无疑是最佳人选
I think he is by far and away the best candidate.

126
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,710
为什么那么说
Why do you say that?

127
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,870
提名一个你了解的人不是更合理吗
Doesn't it make sense for you to nominate someone you know so well?

128
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,450
我不了解他  所以才派你去圣路易斯
I don't know him. That's why I sent you to St. Louis.

129
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,300
抱歉总统先生  我不是那个意思
Forgive me, Mr. President. I didn't mean it that way.

130
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,960
我是说全世界都了解他
I meant that the world knows so well.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,130
你  我  所有人都知道雷蒙德・塔斯克
You, me, everyone knows Raymond Tusk.

132
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,130
他的厉害我们不必多说
We don't need to convince anyone of his worthiness.

133
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,080
但你说他依然很犹豫
But you said he still seems ambivalent?

134
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,780
所以我觉得您应该亲自行动
Which is why I think you should make a personal overture.

135
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,210
请他来白宫
Invite him to the White House.

136
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,030
我不想显得太急切
Well, I don't want to appear desperate.

137
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,880
我赞成弗兰克
I agree with Frank.

138
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,930
请他来  这办法很好
Inviting him is a very good idea.

139
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,100
如果您真想用塔斯克  就跟他同桌共饮
If you're serious about Tusk, you should wine and dine him.

140
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,590
让他觉得自己很特别
Make him feel very special.

141
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,250
我想能为他安排出时间
I'm sure we can find time in the schedule.

142
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,290
让他再考虑几天吧
Let's give him a few more days.

143
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,490
我们时间不够一周了  先生
We have less than a week, sir.

144
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,640
不能迟过周五
I wouldn't wait any later than Friday.

145
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,000
周五可以  先生
We can make Friday work, sir.

146
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,950
好吧  那就看看他能不能来
All right. Well, let's see if he's available.

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,850
你在干什么
What are you doing?

148
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,420
-给我你手机  -为什么
- Give me your phone. - Why?

149
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,770
快给我
Just give it to me.

150
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,350
你注意到家里有什么怪事吗
Have you noticed anything weird in here?

151
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,170
东西动地方  或是不见了
Stuff moved around? Anything missing?

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,780
-没有  -有人跟踪你吗
- No. - Anyone following you?

153
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,590
你发现什么了
What did you find out?

154
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,730
事情很严重  佐伊
This is serious, Zoe.

155
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,830
涉及到了警察局长
It goes way up, as high as the commissioner.

156
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,970
我跟警队的联络人好说歹说才拿到这个
I had to beg my contact at Metro to give me this.

157
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,970
没有罗素被拦下的记录
No record of Russo getting pulled over,

158
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,620
但他记得有个应召女郎跟罗素一起被捕
but he remembers there was a call girl brought in with Russo.

159
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,580
这是她之前一次被捕的案宗
That's a file on one of her previous arrests.

160
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,490
我调查过警察掩盖案件
I've investigated police cover-ups before.

161
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,400
我持续一年收到死亡威胁
I got death threats for a year.

162
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,830
你愿意担这种风险吗
Are you willing to take that risk?

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
愿意
Yeah.

164
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,530
要多久
How long?

165
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,740
下次董事会要三周后
The next board of directors meeting is three weeks from now.

166
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,220
太迟了  雷米
That is too late. Remy, look,

167
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,400
总统在一周内就会提名他
the President is gonna nominate Tusk in a week or less.

168
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,540
我敦促斯科特・坎宁汉召集紧急会议
I've urged Scott Cunningham to call a special meeting,

169
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,010
但一时半会儿也办不成啊
but that doesn't happen overnight.

170
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,050
这种事很复杂的
There's a lot of machinery in a corporate attack like this.

171
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,950
我要亲自和斯科特・坎宁汉谈谈
I want to meet Scott Cunningham myself.

172
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,080
我不会安排你们会面  你知道规矩
I'm not sitting you down with Scott. You know the rules.

173
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,000
现在是特殊情况
These are extraordinary circumstances.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,870
弗兰克  桑科的高管
Frank, Sancorp's officers

175
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,710
绝不会跟政客会面
do not meet with politicians, period.

176
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,630
你跟我谈  我转述给斯科特・坎宁汉
You talk to me, I talk to Scott Cunningham,

177
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,040
或是反过来  这是规矩
and vice versa. That's how it works.

178
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,770
好吧  雷米  就按你说的吧
All right, Remy. Whatever you think best.

179
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,920
有消息我会通知你
I'll call you when I know more.

180
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,310
南茜
Nancy!

181
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
我所尊重的东西里
Of all the things I hold in high regard,

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,630
不包括"规矩"
rules are not one of them.

183
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,380
如果可以直接接触供应商
I will not place my fate solely in the hands of the middleman

184
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,520
我就不会把命运完全交给中间人
if I can go directly to the supplier.

185
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,590
订一张明早去亚特兰大的机票  通知密查姆
Book a flight to Atlanta. Tomorrow morning. Let Meechum know.

186
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,650
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

187
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,460
她在弗吉尼亚州的林奇堡长大
She grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia,

188
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,680
就读于洛马高中
went to Lorimer High School

189
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,790
高二时退学
until she dropped out sophomore year,

190
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,680
之后就再没有过公共记录
and then after that, there's no public record.

191
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
但这儿只说她在2012年4月
But all it says here is that she was fined $300

192
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,100
因滞留街头被罚款三百元
for loitering on April 2012.

193
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,790
得有个人去趟林奇堡
One of us has to go to Lynchburg.

194
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,350
接触一下她的父母  同学
Parents, classmates,

195
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,400
-和老师  -我去吧
- teachers... - I'll do it.

196
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,270
好吧  那打电话招妓就是我们俩的事了
Okay. Well, then, you and I have to call escort services.

197
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,630
我很乐意帮忙
I'm willing to lend a hand,

198
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,550
但我可不想整天打电话
but not by making cold calls 12 hours a day

199
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,190
然后被妓女纠缠
just to get hung up on by hookers.

200
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,560
她是在哪被捕的
Where was she arrested?

201
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,350
-康涅狄格大街  -2460号
- Connecticut ave. - 2460.

202
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,050
那是当地的一家豪华酒店
That's the address of the district grand hotel.

203
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,400
桑科

204
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,810
我可不喜欢不速之客  弗兰克
I'm not a fan of surprise visits, Frank.

205
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,410
雷米不肯安排我们见面
Remy wouldn't arrange a meeting.

206
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,150
雷米・丹顿的存在  就是让我们不必见面
Remy Danton exists so we don't have to meet.

207
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,080
我必须和你谈谈
I needed to speak with you.

208
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,830
国会的旅行报告
There's a congressional travel report

209
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,090
会记录你来过亚特兰大
that puts you on a trip to Atlanta

210
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,630
而同一天  我中途离开了投资者通报会
the same day I was pulled out of an investors' briefing.

211
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,850
我们一直力图避免这种巧合
Those are the sort of coincidences we want to avoid.

212
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,720
你是在跟投资者说雷蒙德・塔斯克吗
Were you briefing your investors on Raymond Tusk?

213
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,290
密查姆是自己人
Meechum can be trusted.

214
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,040
我为什么要跟他们提塔斯克
Why would I be speaking to them about Tusk?

215
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,090
-我以为雷米告诉过你了  -没有
- I thought Remy filled you in. - No.

216
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,460
他完全没提提名副总统的事吗
He didn't say anything about the vice presidential nomination?

217
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,390
没有  而且我预感我也不想知道
He didn't. And I have a feeling I'd rather not be told.

218
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,940
相信我  你会想知道的
Trust me, you want to know.

219
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,010
我曾面对过陪审团  弗兰克
I've appeared in front of grand juries before, Frank.

220
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,720
能说实话可轻松多了
It's much easier when you can tell the truth.

221
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,070
拜托  别让我不得不撒谎脱身
Please, don't put me in a position where I have to lie.

222
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,820
如果总统对塔斯克言听计从
If Tusk has the President's ear,

223
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,230
这届政府就会
you will see this administration

224
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,100
不再支持天然气  转而支持核能
shift its support toward nuclear energy and away from natural gas.

225
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,870
你得去收购他的子公司和供应商
His subsidiaries and his suppliers, go after them.

226
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,420
弗兰克  谈话该到此为止了
Frank, we should end this conversation right now.

227
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,760
如果让他觉得资产保密委托后
He will not accept the nomination

228
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,390
他将无法对抗面临的威胁
if his assets are in a blind trust

229
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,460
他就不会接受提名了
and he can't fight off the threat.

230
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,610
-别再说了  -斯科特
- Okay, we're done. - Scott...

231
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,170
我一个字都不想再听了
I don't wanna hear another word.

232
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,510
回机场去吧
Go back to the airport.

233
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,730
给今天来亚特兰大找个好理由
Figure out a good reason you needed to be in Atlanta today.

234
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,430
在前面转弯处靠边停吧
You can pull over at the next corner.

235
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,890
我会叫车来接我
I'll have my car pick me up.

236
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,740
-来最后一杯吗  -继续倒
- One last one? - Another.

237
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,790
-要喝点什么吗  -白葡萄酒
- Can I get you something? - White wine.

238
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,250
记在我账上
Put that on my tab.

239
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,900
-谢谢  -荣幸之至
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

240
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,980
很快就不能点单了
They're about to call last call.

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,580
没关系  我也不是很能喝
That's all right. I don't have much of a tolerance.

242
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,660
再来一杯吗
One more?

243
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,340
不用  就这样吧
No. I'm good.

244
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
你该上楼去睡
You should head upstairs.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
我在等你
I was waiting for you.

246
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,970
-那是新的水龙头吗  -是的
- Is that the new faucet? - Yeah.

247
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,550
进展如何
How'd it go?

248
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,550
不是很好  雷米有所企图
Not good. Remy's up to something.

249
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,110
也不回我电话
He's not returning my phone calls.

250
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,050
我能做什么
What can I do?

251
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,980
告诉我你梦到了什么
Tell me what you were dreaming.

252
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,960
很可怕  弗兰西斯
Oh, it was so awful, Francis.

253
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,160
他也让我无法入睡
He's not letting me sleep either.

254
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,210
不是他  是孩子们
Yeah. It's not him. It's the kids.

255
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,270
我跟他们在后院玩
I was playing with them in the backyard,

256
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,620
女孩爬到藤蔓上去了
and the girl was climbing on the vines,

257
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,560
我一直劝她下来...
and I kept telling her to stop and get down, and...

258
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,980
藤蔓突然把她缠住  就是不放开
The vines just took hold of her, and they wouldn't let go.

259
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,820
她厉声尖叫
And she was screaming so loud,

260
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,360
我就一直使劲拉
and I just kept pulling harder and harder,

261
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,470
后来她被撕成两半
and she just ripped in half.

262
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,660
好了  没事了
Come here. Come here. Okay.

263
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,780
天呐
Jesus!

264
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,250
你等到凌晨两点之后才回我电话
You wait until after 2:00 in the morning to return my call?

265
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,760
就想给我留言吧
You trying to get my voice-mail?

266
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,770
我要说的话不能在手机上说
The conversations we're having we can't be having on cell phones.

267
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,880
你在哪
Where are you?

268
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,680
克莱尔在楼上睡觉
Claire is sleeping upstairs.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
你不该去见坎宁汉
You shouldn't have gone to see Cunningham.

270
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,770
他说你没有提起塔斯克
He says you didn't bring up Tusk.

271
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,350
你觉得他真会承认吗
You really think he'd admit to that?

272
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,570
如果我们这么做  就是内线交易
If we go through with this, it's insider trading.

273
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,400
我觉得他不是第二次听到这消息
He didn't strike me as a man hearing the news for the second time.

274
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,890
你觉得我在耍你吗
You want to believe I'm playing games?

275
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,430
现在我就抽身而出
I can walk away from the whole thing.

276
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,420
但现在没别人能帮你了
But I'm all you've got right now.

277
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,610
是我在帮你和桑科
I'm the one doing you and Sancorp a favor,

278
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,270
不是反过来
not the other way around.

279
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,840
被利用我还看的出来  弗兰克
I can tell when I'm being used, Frank.

280
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,790
我只想知道为了什么
I just want to know what for.

281
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,690
我不会利用我事后不能甩开的人
I don't use people unless I can throw them away afterwards.

282
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,240
我是在强化我们之间的合作关系
I'm trying to strengthen our partnership.

283
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,230
我觉得你是在骗人
Smells an awful lot like bullshit.

284
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,030
别一副高高在上的口气
Don't condescend.

285
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,650
为你工作八年
Eight years I worked on your staff

286
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,940
我最多也就是站在你家门前
and never once made it further than your front doorstep.

287
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,600
现在我站在你家客厅了  弗兰克
Well, now I'm in your living room, Frank.

288
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,160
不是因为你的教导
It's not because of what you taught me,

289
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,460
而是我终于意识到我的价值
it's because I finally woke up to what my value is

290
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,830
和为你卖命是多么屈才
and how undervalued I was slaving away for you.

291
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,750
这是正事  伤心事自己知道就行
This is business. Keep your sob story to yourself.

292
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,750
我想坚守住
I want to maintain

293
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,630
我在白宫辛苦经营的影响力
the influence that I have worked to achieve in the White House,

294
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,180
这份影响力进而转化为
which translates into the influence

295
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,290
你在白宫的影响力
that you have in the White House,

296
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,070
都是通过我
through me.

297
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,270
我明天再跟斯科特谈谈
I'll get in touch with Scott again tomorrow.

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,050
看能不能尽快办妥
See if we can push this forward faster.

299
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,260
谢谢  雷米
Thank you, Remy.

300
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,090
但你得让我按我的方式来
But you gotta let me do this my way.

301
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,620
她说得很清楚
The message was very clear.

302
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,880
她不想和解  无论金额多少
She doesn't want a settlement, no matter what the figure.

303
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,870
即使我们把世界之井还她吗
Even if we give her World Well back?

304
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,460
她坚持要上法庭
She wants to go to court.

305
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,930
他们说下周就会有正式传票
They said we can expect a formal summons next week.

306
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,950
-这太荒唐了  -她律师也这么认为
- This is ludicrous. - Her lawyers agree.

307
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,980
他们也愿意和解  但她不同意
They'd much prefer a settlement too, but she's not playing ball.

308
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,290
我会继续施压  与此同时
I'll keep pushing them. But in the meantime,

309
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,510
你得整理一下
you should start gathering

310
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,530
你们之间所有的通讯
all the correspondence you ever had with her...

311
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,990
电子邮件  笔记  什么都别落下
E-mails, notes, every scrap of paper.

312
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,590
好的  谢谢  奥利弗
Okay. Thanks, Oliver.

313
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,320
我只不过想找到她
All I'm trying to do is find her.

314
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,270
我有份2012年4月她被捕的记录
I've got an arrest record from April 2012,

315
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,410
我知道一月她和一位客户的车被警察拦下
and I know she was pulled over with a client in January.

316
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,350
那个姑娘  她非常有潜力
That girl. She had so much potential.

317
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,700
她为什么辍学
Why did she drop out?

318
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,520
我说过了  由于道德缘故
Like I said, it's an ethical breach for me

319
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,380
我不能透露任何...
to discuss anything that has to do...

320
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,960
我和她父母谈过了
I spoke to her parents.

321
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,980
她父亲态度很横
Her father was very combative.

322
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,950
是家里的问题吗
Was there trouble at home?

323
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,980
父亲  是不是...
The father... did he...

324
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,120
我不会谈瑞秋的事
I won't speak about Rachel.

325
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,030
能简要和我谈谈你的工作吗
Can you talk to me about your job in general,

326
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,000
概括下你都负责什么样的案子
the sorts of cases you deal with in an abstract way?

327
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,250
如果我担心某个学生
When I'm concerned about a student,

328
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,190
尤其是可能涉及到犯法行为时
especially if there's possible criminal activity involved,

329
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,660
我必须联系地方检察官办公室
it's my duty to contact the D.A.'s office.

330
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,960
如果地检提出控告
Now, if the D.A. pursues charges,

331
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,380
那名学生就得作证指控自己的父母
the student has to testify against their own parent.

332
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,080
让年轻人做这样的抉择太难了
That's a difficult decision for a young person to make.

333
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,050
非常难
Extremely difficult.

334
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,360
逃跑反倒容易些
It could be easier to run away.

335
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,510
会面定于明天
It's set for tomorrow.

336
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,760
塔斯克七点半到  然后直接去白宫
Tusk lands at 7:30 and then heads straight to the White House

337
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,860
和总统共进晚餐
for dinner with the President.

338
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,310
-这在官方行程上吗  -不在
- Is it on the official schedule? - No.

339
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,080
-我们得写上去  -我不能那么做
- We need it to be. - Well, I can't do that.

340
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,230
总统特意嘱咐我别写进去
The President specifically asked that I leave it off.

341
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,320
实际上  好极了  我们能利用那点
Actually, that's good. We can make that work.

342
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,640
你能为总统和博奇安排一次会面吗
Can you set up a meeting between Birch and the President?

343
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,460
关于什么事
About what?

344
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,390
让他对总统的提名发表意见
So he can give him his two cents about who he will nominate.

345
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,010
我认为不该把博奇扯进来
I don't think we want Birch getting involved.

346
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,320
-他不会有机会的  -你有什么计划
- He'll never get the chance. - What are you planning?

347
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,610
今天晚些时候能安排会面吗  行不行
Can you set up a meeting for later today? Yes or no?

348
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,150
我会挤出时间的
I'm sure I can squeeze it in.

349
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,170
好  我会找博奇谈  给他打电话
Good. I'll talk to Birch. Get him on the phone.

350
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,910
这事得保密  就像和塔斯克的晚餐会面
This has to stay off the books, just like the dinner with Tusk.

351
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,300
-好的  -最后
- Okay. - And finally,

352
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,610
你有能开除的排程员吗
do you have a scheduler that you can fire?

353
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,740
弗兰克・安德伍德  查看邮箱

354
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,420
简宁  我有料给你
Janine, I've got something for you.

355
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,270
这是什么
What is this?

356
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,040
总统今天至周五的秘密行程
The President's O.T.R. schedule between now and Friday.

357
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,110
-你怎么得到的  -这不重要
- How'd you get this? - It doesn't matter.

358
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,290
看看他今天下午和谁见面
Look who he's meeting with this afternoon.

359
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,590
-鲍勃・博奇  -再看看周五晚上的
- Bob Birch. - And look at Friday night.

360
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,520
雷蒙德・塔斯克
Raymond Tusk.

361
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,770
这些见面没什么不寻常的
These aren't the craziest meetings for him to be having.

362
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,210
那为什么不列在官方行程里
Then why aren't they on the official schedule?

363
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,690
他们是副总统的候选人
He's considering them for Vice President.

364
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,180
这倒是个保密的好理由
I'd say that's reason enough to keep them secret.

365
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,570
发布出去  马上
Get this out, right away.

366
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,750
议长先生  我听说
Mr. Speaker, I'm hearing that

367
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,120
总统正考虑让你做副总统
you're gonna be considered for the Vice Presidency.

368
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,190
头条网报道
Slugline is reporting that

369
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,340
你正要前往白宫
you're heading to the White House right now.

370
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,620
-我  不是  -你不是去白宫吗
- I'm, uh... no. - You're not headed to the White House?

371
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,430
是的  总统想问我的意见
Yes. The President just wants my input.

372
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,330
但有可能
But there's the possibility

373
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,870
你自己也在考虑范围内
that you might be under consideration yourself.

374
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,030
据我所知不是  抱歉
Not that I'm aware of. Excuse me.

375
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,460
行程怎么流出去的
How did the schedule get out?

376
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,480
是排程办公室的人泄露的  先生
It got leaked, sir, by someone in the scheduling office.

377
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,710
-故意的吗  -是意外
- On purpose? - Accidentally.

378
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,950
附件粘进了对外的邮件里
A wrong attachment to an e-mail that went wide.

379
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,410
不论是谁  给我开除
Well, whoever it was, I want them out.

380
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,420
我已经解雇他们了
I already let them go.

381
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,670
-博奇还在这里吗  -他正等在外面
- Is, uh, Birch here yet? - He's waiting outside.

382
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,230
会面取消  告诉他临时有事
Well, cancel the meeting. Tell him something came up.

383
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,570
-我不想助长流言  -是的  先生
- I don't want to feed the frenzy. - Yes, sir.

384
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,770
请帮我接专线
Give me the private line, please.

385
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,240
我家街上停着三辆卫星车
There are three satellite trucks on my street.

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,040
我被困在自己家里了
I'm trapped in my own home.

387
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,810
是排程办公室的人闯的祸
Somebody in the scheduling office fucked up.

388
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,980
你真在考虑博奇
Are you seriously considering Birch?

389
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,290
当然没有
Absolutely not.

390
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,180
我们失去控制了  加勒特
We are losing control of the process, Garrett.

391
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,720
每次我对你诉说  你从未做出过回应
Every time I've spoken to you, you've never spoken back.

392
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,300
但考虑到我们互相鄙视
Although given our mutual disdain,

393
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,140
我不能责怪你的沉默
I can't blame you for the silent treatment.

394
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,730
或许我找错了对象
Perhaps I'm speaking to the wrong audience.

395
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,230
你听得到吗
Can you hear me?

396
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,820
你会说话吗
Are you even capable of language,

397
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,890
或是你只明白堕落
or do you only understand depravity?

398
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,450
彼得  是你吗
Peter, is that you?

399
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,910
别躲在我的脑袋里了  出来吧
Stop hiding in my thoughts and come out.

400
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,360
如今你死了  拿出生前没有的勇气吧
Have the courage in death that you never had in life.

401
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,060
出来吧  直视我的眼睛说出你想说的
Come out, look me in the eye and say what you need to say.

402
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,270
天堂地狱都没法给你慰藉
There is no solace above or below.

403
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,420
只有我们自己  渺小  孤独
Only us... Small, solitary,

404
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,340
奋斗  与彼此斗争
striving, battling one another.

405
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,230
我向自己祈祷  为自己祈祷
I pray to myself, for myself.

406
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,460
你好
Hello?

407
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,330
谁啊
Who is it?

408
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,280
我的律师让我不要和你说话
My lawyer said I shouldn't be talking to you.

409
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,900
我的也是
Mine said the same thing.

410
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,430
我不会改变主意的  克莱尔
I'm not gonna change my mind, Claire.

411
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,640
我犯了个错误  我生气了  一时冲动
I made a mistake. I got upset, and I acted impulsively.

412
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,660
是我犯了个错误
I was the one who made the mistake

413
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,430
我就不该跟你合作
by partnering with you in the first place.

414
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,920
好吧  那我们可以承认
Well, then, can we please both admit

415
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,260
事情本不该闹成这样  有平和的...
that it wasn't meant to be, and we can find an amicable way...

416
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,870
-不行的  -你想怎样
- No, we can't. - What do you want?

417
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,310
传递一个信息
To send a message.

418
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,240
像你这样的组织吞掉大把善款
Organizations like yours get 90% of the grant money,

419
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,390
再去奉承破坏环境的捐助者
then cozy up to corporate sponsors who destroy the environment.

420
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,130
你所说的全是谎话
The things you're claiming are lies.

421
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,180
我从没提及你怀孕的事
I never mentioned your pregnancy.

422
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,250
我和伊芙琳・巴克斯特联系过了
I got in touch with Evelyn Baxter.

423
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,830
记得她吗  我们聊得可久了
Remember her? We had a long conversation.

424
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,290
似乎你总是炒掉和你意见不一的人
It seems that you have a history of axing people who disagree with you.

425
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,610
她会为我作证
She'll be testifying on my behalf.

426
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,870
还有你让她炒掉的八个人
So will eight of the people that you made her fire.

427
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,320
如果你要我道歉  我就是来道歉的
If you want an apology, I'm here to offer you one,

428
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,950
并给你任何你认为合理的补偿
and to give you whatever you think is fair.

429
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,840
这案子将因为你丈夫
This case is gonna get national attention

430
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,330
得到全国范围的关注
because of who you're married to.

431
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,320
我将有机会发表自己的看法
I'll have a platform to say what I want to say.

432
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,370
这比你能提供的都好
That's worth more than anything you could offer.

433
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,280
听着  我们的确观念不同
Listen, I know we have different philosophies,

434
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,540
但我们的目标是一样的
but what we're trying to achieve is exactly the same thing.

435
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,790
我们不该相互敌对
We shouldn't be fighting each other.

436
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,960
感觉到了吗  胎动
Do you feel that? The kicking?

437
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,130
我不会让你这样的人
I won't let people like you

438
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,290
毁了我的孩子将居住的世界
fuck up the world my child has to live in.

439
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,230
如果我必须要说些谎
If I have to tell a few lies to do that...

440
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,860
至少我从你那儿学了件有用的东西
At least I learned one valuable thing from you.

441
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,930
-要点什么  -纯格兰利威
- What can I get for you? - Glenlivet, neat.

442
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,720
烦诉讼的事吗
The lawsuit?

443
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,690
还有别的事
And other things.

444
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,970
什么事
What other things?

445
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,970
我没法保证
You know, I cannot guarantee you

446
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,920
这一切都将成功
that all of this is gonna succeed.

447
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,250
不是为那个
Oh, it's not that.

448
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,460
说吧  不然我就一直猜下去
You can tell me, or I can keep guessing.

449
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,510
你会翻白眼的
You'll roll your eyes.

450
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,610
不会的
Not at you.

451
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,750
我在想我们俩谁先死了
I was thinking about when one of us dies

452
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,070
不管是谁先...
whether it's you first or me...

453
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,540
如果是我  而且肯定是我
Well, if it is me, and I'm sure it will be,

454
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,450
你也不会孤独太久的
you won't be alone for long.

455
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,080
不  我是说  我们会留下什么
No. I mean, what will we leave behind?

456
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,010
我们做了很多大事
We've accomplished a great deal.

457
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,700
我们还会有更多成就
And I intend for us to accomplish a lot more.

458
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,880
为了谁呢
But for whom?

459
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
为了彼此
For each other.

460
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,760
但如果我们不...
But if we're not...

461
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,300
我说傻话了
Ah, I'm being silly.

462
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,890
你出过书吗
Have you ever been published?

463
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,470
好多次了
Many times.

464
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,040
这问题真傻
I guess that's a stupid question.

465
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,810
你不像个挨饿的艺术家
You don't seem like a starving artist.

466
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,680
别以貌取人
Don't judge a book by its cover.

467
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,530
你的笑声很好听
You have a nice laugh.

468
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,740
-真的吗  -很有魅力
- Really? - It's very attractive.

469
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,380
你待在酒店吗
Are you staying at the hotel?

470
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,360
你想来我房间吗
You want to come up to my room?

471
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,540
看情况
That depends.

472
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,060
我要付多少钱
Well, how much would that cost me?

473
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,780
这些钱就差不多
That seems about right.

474
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,740
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

475
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,790
伸出手
Put out your hands.

476
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,580
睁开眼睛
Now open them up.

477
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,140
我在找这个女人
I'm trying to find this woman.

478
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,530
如果你逼我亮出警徽
If you make me pull out my badge,

479
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,620
我就不得不逮捕你
I have to take you in.

480
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,900
但我不想那么做
But I don't want to do that.

481
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,140
别在这儿现眼
Let's not make a scene.

482
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,980
我以前常看到她
I used to see her around.

483
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,670
但她离开这一行了  我们没怎么联系
She left the business, though. We haven't really kept in touch.

484
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,580
知道她可能在哪吗
Any idea where she might be?

485
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,470
我的一个朋友见过她
A friend of mine saw her waiting tables

486
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,620
在乔治城的一家餐馆做服务员
at a restaurant in Georgetown.

487
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,270
我想问的问题是...
I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, um...

488
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,500
有必要做尝试吗
Is it even worth that step?

489
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,450
总的来说
The bottom line is that

490
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,140
对于你这个年纪的女人  会非常难
for a woman your age, it's extremely hard.

491
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,320
你流过产吗
Have you ever had a miscarriage?

492
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,710
没有  我...
No. I, um...

493
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,920
我有过晚的时候  但...
I've been late before, but

494
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,380
其实我也不能确定
I don't... You know, I don't know. I don't know exactly.

495
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,480
你堕过胎吗
Have you had any abortions?

496
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,790
三次
Three.

497
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,010
那就更棘手了
That can make it more difficult.

498
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,080
我不是在劝阻你
I'm not trying to dissuade you,

499
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,970
但你务必要经过深思熟虑之后再决定
but please make sure you think long and hard before you decide.

500
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,390
但是有可能的
But it's possible?

501
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,010
如果你和你丈夫符合全部标准
Assuming you and your husband fit all the criteria?

502
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,280
是的  可能
Yes, it's possible.

503
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,350
好的
Okay.

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,780
什么  这不是我的问题
What? Well, that's hardly my problem.

505
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,260
不  你去做就是...
No, you get on it. It's...

506
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,800
我一会儿打给你  什么事
I have to call you back. What is it?

I try not to follow the news.

568
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,440

Too many familiar faces.

她提到了你和你的上司
She mentioned both you and your boss.

579

他酒驾被拦下时我也在车上
I was in the car with him when he got pulled over.

你没有说别的吧
And you didn't admit to more than that?

583
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,790
没有  我完全按你说的讲
No. I said everything exactly like you told me to.

584

-你真以为我会和盘托出吗  -冷静点
- You really think I'd spill my guts? - Calm down.

585
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,590
你为什么不告诉我他会伤害自己
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?

586
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,010
否则我绝不会那么做
I never would've done it.

587
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,080
我怎么知道会那样
How could I have known?

-我只希望这事快点过去  -会的

要我为你订晚餐吗
Do you want me to order you dinner?

00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,540
-道格在哪  -我不知道  他提早走了
- Where's Doug at? - I don't know. He left early.

593
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,670
-帮我联系他  -好  先生
- Call him for me, will you? - Yes, sir.

594
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,900
再过十三分钟
Thirteen minutes from now,

595
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,440
塔斯克就要和总统会面
Tusk will meet with the President,

596
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,950
他大概早就到了
if he isn't there already.

597
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,000
你从来都不是我的盟友  不是吗
You've never been an ally, have you?

598
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,210
缓慢坚定地向前推进
Pressing on with your slow, incessant march.

599
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,190
就算我不出手  时间也会杀死罗素
Time would've killed Russo if I hadn't,

600
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,090
有一日它也会夺去我的生命
just as it will kill me someday.

601
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,240
无人能逃
Kill us all.

602
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,410
先生  道格没接  进入语音信箱了
Sir, I just got Doug's voicemail.

603
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,780
不知道他在哪里
I wonder where he's at.

604
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,040
可能是他
Well, maybe this is him.

605
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,300
弗莱迪
Freddy?

606
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,610
抱歉  弗兰克  良禽择木而栖
Sorry, Frank. I had to trade up.

607
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,720
桑科是大鱼  但雷蒙德・塔斯克是巨鲸
Sancorp's a big fish, but Raymond Tusk is a whale.

608
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,590
想吃点什么吗  弗兰克
Can I get you something, Frank?

609
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,400
暂时不要  谢谢  弗莱迪
Nothing right now. Thank you, Freddy.

610
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,150
我不打扰你们
I'll leave y'all to it.

611
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,380
我希望你别介意
I hope you don't mind that

612
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,880
雷米告诉了我你的小秘密
Remy told me about this little secret of yours.

613
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,310
我想找一个你觉得舒服的地方
I wanted a place where you'd feel comfortable.

614
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,180
你现在不该在白宫吗
Shouldn't you be at the White House?

615
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,250
我怎么能错过华盛顿最好的肋排呢
How could I pass up the chance to eat the best ribs in Washington?

616
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,120
雷米跟你说了桑科的事
Remy told you about Sancorp.

617
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,720
到今天收盘时  我有3%的股份
As of closing bell today, I own 3%.

618
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,730
到下周末  我的股份将超过10%
By the end of next week, I'll own over ten.

619
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,900
足以解我后顾之忧了
Enough to make sure they can't cause me any trouble.

620
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,560
不过是个大胆的尝试  我很钦佩
A valiant effort, though. I respect that.

621
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,900
那你找我来干什么
So why are we here?

622
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,490
我说过会让你考虑到今天
I told you I'd give you until today to think things over.

623
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,630
-我是个信守承诺的人  -我还是没兴趣
- I'm a man who keeps my word. - And I'm still not interested.

624
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,340
在圣路易斯时  你让我详说
You wanted me to be more specific back in St. Louis.

625
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,980
那会是个良好的开端
That would be a good start.

626
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,700
英国150年前为什么对中国发动战争
Why did Britain go to war with China 150 years ago?

627
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,540
我没心情猜谜
I'm in no mood for riddles.

628
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,290
迁就我一下吧
Humor me a moment.

629
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,630
-鸦片  -远不止鸦片  弗兰克
- Opium. - It was bigger than opium, Frank.

630
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,840
那只是借口
That was simply the excuse.

631
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,850
中国政府不想受西方牵制  要自己做主
Peking wanted to call the shots instead of the west.

632
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,860
我们现在也面临着这个问题
It's the same problem we're facing now.

633
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,120
但人们讨厌贸易战争  更不用说军事战争了
But nobody wants a trade war, much less a military one.

634
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,900
你的鸦片是什么
And what's your opium?

635
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,730
钐149  我的反应堆需要
Samarium-149. I need it for my reactors.

636
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,700
中国控制了世界95%的供给
China controls 95% of the world's supply.

637
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,630
你在担心
And you're worried about

638
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,980
我们货币的不平衡  我们的外债
the imbalance in our currency, our foreign debt...

639
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,270
-一切  -总统已经很听你话了
- All of it. - You already have the President's ear.

640
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,480
贸易关税由国会控制
Trade tariffs are controlled by congress.

641
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,170
你在那里比加勒特更有影响力
You have a lot more influence there than Garrett does.

642
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,660
这也是我之前把你留在那儿的原因
It's the reason I wanted you to stay there in the first place.

643
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,490
那你具体要我做些什么
And what exactly would you want me to do?

644
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,400
我还不清楚
Well, that part I don't know yet.

645
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,390
得等着看中国那边的情况
We'll have to wait and see how things play out with the Chinese.

646
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,420
我告诉过你了  我不开空头支票
I've already told you I will not do a blank check.

647
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,530
我真是没想到啊  弗兰克
I must say I'm surprised, Frank.

648
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,040
你一向以务实闻名
You have a reputation for pragmatism.

649
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,570
我还不跟人签卖身契
And I also have avoided a reputation for indentured servitude.

650
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,810
一个提议我不说三次  弗兰克
I never make an offer more than twice, Frank.

651
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,090
如果你愿意合作  现在就告诉我
Tell me now if I can count on your cooperation.

652
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,510
你不是在提议合作  而是在要求监管
You're not offering cooperation. You're demanding tutelage.

653
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,510
我向你提个议吧
So let me make you a proposal.

654
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,660
我非常愿意与你平等合作
I am absolutely willing to work together as equals.

655
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,150
我会像总统一样重视你的想法
I will take your opinions seriously, just as the President does.

656
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,460
但我不会提前做出保证
But I will not bind myself to them in advance.

657
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,390
如果那不够吸引你
If that doesn't interest you, fair enough.

658
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,010
那就祝你能在接下来四天找到一位
Good luck finding a vice President in the next four days

659
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,540
和我一样务实的副总统
who will prove as pragmatic as I.

660
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,850
你买不到忠心  雷蒙德
You can't purchase loyalty, Raymond.

661
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,720
我想的那种不行
Not the sort I have in mind.

662
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,280
如果你想赢得我的忠心
If you want to earn my loyalty,

663
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,110
就得以你的忠心为交换
then you have to offer yours in return.

664
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,510
如果这点能达成一致
And if we can agree to that...

665
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,170
那么
Well,

666
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,900
你是个有想象力的人
you're a man with imagination.

667
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,660
等等
Wait.

668
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,890
如果斯坦普本人在那儿
If Stamper was there himself,

669
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,580
这就比一份消失的逮捕文件严重得多
this goes much deeper than a lost arrest file.

670
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,420
咱们想想
Well, let's think about this.

671
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,050
罗素给了他什么
What did Russo gain him?

672
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,140
宾州州长
A mansion in Harrisburg.

673
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,980
安德伍德的野心不止于此
Uh-uh. Underwood thinks bigger than that.

674
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,230
-那是什么  -不知道
- Then what? - I don't know.

675
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,400
他控制了宾州
He controls Pennsylvania.

676
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,930
在白宫就有影响力
He has influence in the White House.

677
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,150
-沃克需要这个州支持他再选  -不
- Walker needs the state for reelection... - No.

678
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,240
不会只是为沃克
No, it can't just be Walker.

679
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,470
总统在提名国务卿时出卖了他
The President backstabbed him for the secretary of state nomination.

680
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,070
一定是别的什么
It has to be something else.

681
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,200
总统欠他人情
The President would owe him.

682
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,300
欠他什么
But what?

683
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,210
他们一周见一次面
They already meet once a week.

684
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,530
教育法案吗  他要什么
The education bill? I mean, what?

685
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,820
具体要什么
What specifically?

686
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,610
他可能想要副总统提名
He could be after the V.P. Nomination.

687
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,350
但这样说不通
That doesn't make sense, though.

688
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:37,140
副总统之所以空出来  是因为罗素输了
The V.P. slot is on the table because Russo tanked.

689
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,070
安德伍德希望他赢
Underwood wanted him to win.

690
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,850
除非不是那样
Unless he didn't.

691
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,260
也许他希望罗素自毁前程
Maybe he wanted Russo to self-destruct.

692
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,730
迫使马修斯竞选
To force Matthews to run.

693
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,720
没错  等到下周马修斯赢得竞选时
Exactly. And then next week, when Matthews wins...

694
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,490
总统就会提名安德伍德
The President taps Underwood.

695
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,620
总统先生
Mr. President.

696
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,810
塔斯克先生
Mr. Tusk.

697
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,740
谢谢你这么快赶过来
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

698
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,910
请坐  弗兰克
Have a seat, Frank.

699
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,860
我要坦白件事
I have a confession to make.

700
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,840
雷蒙德和我是老相识
Raymond and I have known each other for years.

701
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,250
我们没让外界知道
We don't publicize it,

702
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,640
他一直是我可信赖的顾问
but he's been a trusted advisor to me.

703
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,190
我让你去圣路易斯
And I sent you to St. Louis

704
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,130
是为了让他了解一下你
so he could spend time with you,

705
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,990
给我点意见
give me his two cents.

706
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,960
恕我冒昧  什么意见  先生
On what, sir, if I may ask?

707
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,060
让你当副总统
Offering you the vice presidency.

708
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,400
我告诉总统  依我个人浅见
I told the president that, uh, in my humble opinion,

709
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,950
有你这样经验丰富  智慧忠诚的副总统
both he and the country would be well served

710
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:46,670
无论他还是国家  必会受益无穷
by a man as experienced, intelligent, and loyal as you.

711
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,510
我现在正式向你提出  弗兰克
So I'm officially asking, Frank.

712
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,600
先生  我都不知道说什么好了
Sir, I... I don't know what to say.

713
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,830
说好
Say yes.

714
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,010
好
Yes.

715
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,290
这真是莫大的荣幸  总统先生
It would be a great honor, Mr. President.

716
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,970
密查姆
Meechum.

717
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,820
我照顾自己人
I take care of my own,

718
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,260
你也证明了自己的价值
and you've proved yourself to be very valuable.

719
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,450
等我上任后  我希望你加入
I would like you to be part of my security detail

720
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,980
我是保安特遣队
once I get confirmed.

721
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,820
那是特勤局的范畴  先生
That's the Secret Service, sir.

722
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,270
我是国会警察
I'm capitol police.

723
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,630
那我就把你调去特勤局
Then I'll put you on the Secret Service.

724
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,780
如果你愿意的话
If you're interested.

725
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,350
我非常愿意  先生
I'd be more than interested, sir.

726
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,180
很好
Good.

727
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,160
也很感激
And I'm extremely grateful.

728
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,290
那就继续发挥价值
Keep being valuable.

729
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,230
这是表达感激最好的方式
That's the best way to show your gratitude.

730
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,960
我会的  副总统先生
I will, Mr. Vice President.

731
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,500
水管工终于来过了
Did the plumber finally come?

732
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,170
没有  是我修的
No. I fixed it.

733
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,090
弗兰西斯
Francis.

734
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,770
真为你骄傲  弗兰西斯
So proud of you, Francis.

735
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,870
不是我一个人的功劳
I didn't do it alone.

736
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,490
我尽快赶过来了
I got here as quickly as I could.

737
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,270
出什么事了吗
Is something wrong?

738
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,920
我要你对我说实话  克里斯蒂娜
I need you to be completely honest with me, Christina.

739
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,790
什么事
About what?
