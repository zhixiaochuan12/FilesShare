1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,440
我知道这听起来很扯
I'm well aware it sounds bananas.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,880
但如果你了解化石记录  
But looking at the fossil record,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,570
具备我对感染的知识
knowing what I know about this infection,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,810
你也会觉得
you cannot say for certain

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,000
这可能是恐龙灭绝的原因
it isn't what killed off the dinosaurs.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,520
我相信这种理论吗
Now, do I believe that's what happened?

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,270
不信
No.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,540
但是想想甲龙行尸追着梁龙
But it's enjoyable as hell to think about an undead ankylosaur

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,140
感觉爽爆了
going after a diplodocus.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,730
这个电子游戏值得预定
That there is a video game worth a preorder.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,160
太棒了  有发现
Oh, hell, yeah. Score.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,900
再捡几个  
A few more of those,

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,730
来点铝箔和漂白剂  
a little aluminum foil and some bleach,

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,390
就能产生电压了  妹子
you got yourself some volts, sister.

15
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,100
自制电池
Homemade battery.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,350
-给  -真的吗
- Here. - For reals?

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
你不想要吗
You don't want it?

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,180
真的
For reals.

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,200
非常感谢
Much obliged.

20
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,120
说到电子游戏  你喜欢玩哪种
Speaking of video games, what kind of gamer were you?

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,020
角色扮演  飞行射击  模拟赛车
RPGs, shmup, sim racing?

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,460
你睡吧  我来守
Go to sleep. I got this.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,710
无意冒犯  但我不放心让你保护尤金
No offense, but I'm not leaving Eugene's life in your hands.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,880
你跟我们一起是因为你需要帮助
You came with us because you wanted help.

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,740
我需要你的帮助  不需要你站岗
You are support, not point.

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,460
我们会和你一起往北走
We'll move north with you

27
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,380
直到我在路边找到合适的车辆
till I find the right vehicle just off the tracks.

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,730
然后五个人就会变成三个
Then five becomes three.

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,600
或者两个
Or two.

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,430
我们都有自己的任务
We each have our missions.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,460
你得睡会儿
You need to get some sleep.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,550
我还没见你睡过呢
I haven't seen you do it yet.

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,550
我之前以为你爱上了他
Thought it was because you were in love with him.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,260
爱上一个男人的女孩
A girl in love with a guy,

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,520
努力帮他找到女友
she's trying to help get to his girl.

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,930
如果真是那样
If that were the case...

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,830
闭上双眼就太难受了
closing your eyes would be just too damn tragic.

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,950
-真是那样就好了  -对
- If that were the case. - Yeah.

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,420
我看见了罗西塔给你端晚餐时
I saw the way you were looking down Rosita's shirt

40
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,990
你看着她的衬衫里面的样子
while she was serving you dinner.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,600
那玩意儿有一种催眠的魔力
Hey, the things are damn near hypnotic.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,410
尤金整天盯着她的屁股看
Look, Eugene spends half the day staring at her ass.

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,950
我不怪你  这只能说明我之前猜错了
I'm not mad, it just means my theory's shot.

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,170
我真心抱歉
I'm awfully sorry about that.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,410
我有对有错
Well, I'm right and I'm wrong.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,450
是因为你做过的事  还是你没做到的事
Something you did or something you didn't do?

47
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,370
我做过的事
Something I did.

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,000
你也当过兵
You were in the army.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,700
我懂那一套"团队合作
I get the whole gung ho,

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,600
任务就是你的生命"的屁话
mission is your life bullshit.

51
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,810
-是啊  你懂  -是啊
- Yeah, you do. - Yeah.

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,010
所以我们都有理由
So we both got our reasons.

53
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,330
都有任务
Both got our missions.

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,390
你的任务结束后  你要做什么
What do you do when the mission's over?

55
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,410
我只是被惹恼了
Been rubbing me wrong, is all.

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,990
我是个讲公平的绅士
I'm an even-Steven type gentleman.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,260
你帮我找到补给品  
You help me find the supplies,

58
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,410
我们会分享电池和发出的电力  
we'll share the battery and whatever juice we scare up,

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,860
虽然微不足道
minimal as it may be.

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,020
成交吗
Deal?

61
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,980

我来吧
I got it.

85
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,010
看来那只三脚猫还是辜负了我们啊
Looks like that Robin Hood cat cut out on us after all.

86
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,100
我还以为他没胆子一个人走掉
I didn't think he had the sack to go out on his own.

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,990
他没走  他的东西还在
He don't. Dude left his stuff here.

88
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,110
也许只是早上去拉屎了
Probably just stepped out to drop a morning deuce.

89
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,790
我们还剩一天的水
I think we got about a day's worth of water left.

90
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,180
幸亏天气凉快了些  但是
We're lucky it's cooled off a little bit, but...

91
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,260
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

92
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,010
-赢得赌注  -你做梦
- Winning a bet. - In your dreams.

93
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,130
我还在铁轨上哦
I'm still on.

94
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,060
你高兴得太早了  聪明蛋
You spoke too soon, wise guy.

95
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,800
我们可能要走很久
This might go on a while.

96
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,390
要不你们快点
Maybe we can speed this up.

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,730
是啊  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

98
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,720
不应该瞎闹
Shouldn't be fooling around.

99
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,080
我们应该  卡尔
We should probably-- Carl!

100
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,580
我赢了
I win.

101
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,310
交出来
Pay up.

102
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,910
那真是最后一根巧克力棒了吗
Is that really the last Big Cat?

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
别这样
Oh, come on.

104
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,810
你说赢了的人可以随便选
Hey, but you said winner's choice.

105
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,900
好吧  拿着吧  是你的了
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

106
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,900
你赢得正大光明
You won it fair and square.

107
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,210
拿着吧  我们总是分着吃
Come on, we always share.

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,020
递过来吧
Fork it over.

109
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,050
你这是干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

110
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,430
弄点早餐吃
Catching me some breakfast.

111
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,560
是我的
That's mine.

112
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,640
是我的箭先射到的
My arrow's the one that hit first.

113
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,210
这只兔子应该归我
The cottontail belongs to me.

114
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,760
日出之前我就守在这了
Been out here since before the sun came up.

115
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,320
打猎的规矩
You see, the rules of the hunt

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,670
在这儿不算数
don't mean jack out here.

117
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,950
你手里拿的兔子
Now, that rabbit you're holding

118
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,410
我要了  小子
is claimed, boy.

119
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,650
不管你乐不乐意  我都要了
Claimed whether you like it or not.

120
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,200
我要是你  我就交出来
So I was you, I'd hand it over.

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,920
赶紧交出来
Now before you get to wishing

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,700
不然你会后悔今早起了床
you ain't never even got out of bed this morning.

123
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,880
这不是你的
It ain't yours.

124
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,130
我敢打赌
You know, I'll bet

125
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,440
有个小贱人
this bitch

126
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,580
把你的脑子弄得一团糟
got you all messed up, hmm?

127
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,740
我说得对吗
Am I right?

128
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,840
让你像一个魂不守舍的
Got you walking around here like a dead man

129
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,080
活死人一样四处晃荡
who just lost himself a piece of tail.

130
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,770
那小妞肯定很不错
Must have been a good'un.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,340
跟我说说
Tell me something.

132
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,820
那小妞是不是个幼齿
Was it one of the little'uns?

133
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,960
幼齿在这里可活不久
'Cause they don't last too long out here.

134
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,780
冷静  伙计们  冷静点
Easy, fellas, easy.

135
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,550
把武器先放下
Let's just put our weapons down.

136
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,290
看看能不能把问题解决了
See if we can't figure out what's really the problem here, huh?

137
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,690
-你喊"我要了"吗  -当然了
- Did you claim it? - Hell, yeah.

138
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,370
那就结了  兔子属于伦
Well, there you go. That critter belongs to Len.

139
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,690
赶紧给我吧
So let's have it.

140
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,730
看起来你想知道是怎么回事
Looks like you may be wanting an explanation.

141
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,170
独自行动  如今已经行不通了
See, going it alone, that ain't an option nowadays.

142
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,320
但是  仍然是优胜劣汰
Still, it is survival of the fittest.

143
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,670
这有点矛盾了
That's a paradox right there.

144
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,540
所以我制定了一些规矩
So I laid out some rules of the road

145
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,180
来防止丛林法则分分钟上演
to keep things from going Darwin every couple hours.

146
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,610
让大家无压力地和平相处
Keep our merry band together and stress-free.

147
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,590
你要做的就是喊一句"我要了"
All you got to do is claim.

148
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,200
你可以这样标记你的领土
That's how you mark your territory,

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,900
你的猎物  还有睡觉的床
your prey, your bed at night.

150
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,370
就喊一句"我要了"
One word, claimed.

151
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,300
我才不喊
I ain't claiming nothing.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,350
我们应该教训他  是吧
We're gonna teach him, right?

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,630
按规矩我们得教训他
The rules say we got to teach him.

154
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,980
因为你违反了一条你不知道的规矩
It wouldn't be fair to punish you

155
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,570
就惩罚你有些不公平
for violating a rule you never even knew existed.

156
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,020
才没有什么规矩
There ain't no rules no more.

157
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,290
有的  你知道的
Oh, there are. You know that.

158
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,270
所以我才没有把你杀掉  抢走你的弩
That's why I didn't kill you for the crossbow.

159
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,830
冷静  伙计
Easy there, partner.

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,580
"我要了"
Claimed.

161
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,340
一句就够了
That's all you got to say.

162
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,490
有屁股吃也比没有强
Hey, ass end is still an end.

163
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,990
等等
Hold up!

164
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,830
我们在这里休息
We're stopping here.

165
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,740
累了反应就慢了
Tired is slow.

166
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,090
-反应慢就会死  -还不到中午
- Slow is dead. - It's barely noon.

167
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,220
我才他妈的不管
I don't give a monkey's left nut.

168
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,270
自从我们玩命般赶路之后
None of us has slept more than a couple hours straight

169
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,120
已经很久没好好睡上一觉了
since we went all Casey Jones.

170
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,570
这地方看起来很安全
This place looks safe.

171
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,780
我们需要休息一下
We need to rest.

172
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,570
我明白  你想找到她
I get it. You have to find her.

173
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,730
但罗西塔和我也有任务
Well, Rosita and me, we got a mission, too.

174
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,580
就是让这个男人活下去
It's keeping that man alive,

175
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,480
把他带到华府
getting him to Washington,

176
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,620
然后拯救他妈的全世界
and saving the whole damn world.

177
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,580
所以我们要进这个塔楼  现在就进
So we're going in that tower and we're going now.

178
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,490
该死
Oh, crap.

179
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,120
小心  快走  快走
Watch out! Go, go!

180
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,060
-快走  -走开  走开
- Go! - Move! Move!

181
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,840
-你还好吧  -我没事
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

182
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,210
我们得留在这儿  谁来帮忙抬一下她
We got to stay here. Who's gonna help me carry her up?

183
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,750
-你没事吧  -没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

184
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,140
你是想停下还是继续走
You wanna stop or you wanna keep going?

185
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,320
不用  继续走  我没事
No, keep going. I'm good.

186
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,430
-你确定  -对  是的
- You sure? - Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,680
看  假如她都能走
Look, if she can keep going,

188
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,870
那我们也能走
we can all keep going.

189
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,000
或者你们可以留在这里
Or you guys can stay here.

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,820
你们不需要我们  我们也不需要你们
You don't need us, we don't need you.

191
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,790
-没关系的  -你真是个混蛋
- It's okay. - Wow, you're an ass.

192
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,440
你说什么她都照做是因为她觉得亏欠你
She will do whatever you say because she thinks she owes you.

193
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,650
拿出点男人的样子
Man up.

194
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,790
在这儿停几个小时
Stay here for a few hours.

195
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,030
你只在乎尤金的安全  是吧
You just care about keeping Eugene safe, right?

196
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,780
所以你才想停下
It's the only reason you want to stop?

197
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,590
我们一直走到太阳落山
We go until sundown,

198
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,130
我把防暴服给尤金
I give Eugene my riot gear

199
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,320
现在就给
right here, right now.

200
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,130
-皆大欢喜  -除了她
- Everybody wins. - Except her.

201
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,440
你不是她妈妈
You're not her mama.

202
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,810
她说她能走  她就能走
She says she can walk, she can walk.

203
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,030
就按你说的办吧
You got yourself a deal.

204
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,580
好
Okay.

205
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
你有什么计划  达里尔
So what's the plan, Daryl?

206
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,060
为什么这么问
How so?

207
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,630
你虽然跟我们搭伴  但你很快会走是吧
You're with us now, but you ain't soon?

208
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,240
是的
Yep.

209
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,330
所以问你有什么计划
So what's the plan?

210
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,760
就想找个合适的地方
Just looking for the right place is all.

211
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,460
我们对你而言不够好是吧
Oh, we ain't good enough for you, huh?

212
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,530
你们中的一些人可算不上友善
Some of you ain't exactly friendly.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
你自己就不太友善
You ain't so friendly yourself.

214
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,490
你知道在这外面你需要一个团队的
You know you need a group out here.

215
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,820
-说不定我不需要  -不  你需要
- Maybe I don't. - No, you do.

216
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,330
你应该和我们待在一起
You should be with us.

217
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,370
大家不一定要友善待人
People don't got to be friendly.

218
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,110
我们不一定要做好人
We don't have to be nice.

219
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,050
也不一定要成为手足兄弟连
We don't have to be brothers in arms.

220
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,780
我们只需要守规矩
We just got to follow the rules.

221
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,420
想要什么你得说一声
You claim.

222
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,330
假如你偷东西  你就得死
If you steal, you keel.

223
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,960
我知道这听起来有点搞笑
I know that sounds a little funny,

224
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,240
但是丢东西时就没人笑得出来了
but nobody laughs when something goes missing.

225
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,160
而且你不能撒谎
And you don't lie.

226
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,740
因为一旦开始就停不下来了
'Cause that's a slippery slope indeed.

227
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,350
假如你坏了规矩怎么办
What happens if you break 'em?

228
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,780
你会挨揍
Oh, you catch a beatin'.

229
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,120
揍的轻重取决于你的行为有多过分
The severity of which depends upon the offense

230
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,180
以及那天大家的态度
and the general attitude of the day.

231
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
但是这种事不常发生
But that don't happen much

232
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,170
因为一旦我们这种人守规矩了
'cause when men like us follow rules

233
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,800
并且相互合作一下
and cooperate a little bit,

234
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,850
世界就是我们的了
well, the world becomes ours.

235
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,280
就那儿了
Right there.

236
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,970
我们今晚的住处
It's our abode for the evening.

237
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,690
不是"我们"
There ain't no us.

238
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,710
你现在就要走吗
You leaving right now?

239
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,640
不走吗
No?

240
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,920
那看来就是"我们"了
Then it sure seems like there's an us.

241
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,470
你爱猫吗  达里尔
You a cat person, Daryl?

242
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,410
我爱
I am.

243
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,390
从三岁时就爱猫
Loved 'em since I was three years old.

244
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,700
恶劣的生物
Vicious creatures.

245
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,390
总之  我告诉你
Anyway, I'll tell you,

246
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,500
这是真的
and this is true,

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,250
把自己当成家猫的野猫
ain't nothing sadder than an outdoor cat

248
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,030
是最可悲的
that thinks he's an indoor cat.

249
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,970
我们离他们越来越近了
We're gaining on 'em.

250
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,620
依然是湿的
Still wet.

251
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,970
和打了光亮剂一样  没法从这上去
We sure as Shinola can't go up and over.

252
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,440
绕过去怎么样
How about around?

253
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,050
不妥
No.

254
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,010
绕过去至少要花一天
That'll take a day, maybe more.

255
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,580
既然玛姬走了这里  我也要走
If Maggie went through, I'm going through.

256
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,620
-我们很接近了  -先别说话
- We're close. - Shut up a second.

257
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,030
你们听到了吗
You hear that?

258
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,940
那可是一条漫长幽暗的隧道
That there is a long, dark tunnel

259
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,090
里面有无数蠢蠢欲动的行尸
full of reanimated corpses.

260
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,530
要带尤金从这穿过去
I don't have full-on certainty

261
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,790
我没有十足的把握能把他活着带出去
that I can get Eugene through there alive.

262
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,830
我的建议是  多花一天时间
My recommendation would be take the day,

263
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,110
绕过这里  小心驶得万年船
make the detour and play it safe,

264
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,200
我猜你肯定不会接受
but I know you're not gonna do that.

265
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,040
所以  我们要在这里分别了
So this is where we've got to part ways.

266
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:24,850
不好意思
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,380
你得靠自己了
You're on your own.

268
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,130
不  你不是一个人
No, you're not.

269
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,840
不  这些是你们的
No, no, no. Those are yours.

270
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,400
你们长途跋涉  需要这些东西
You guys will need them for your trip.

271
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,400
你也一样
You will, too.

272
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,470
多谢
Thank you.

273
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,990
对不起
Sorry, I...

274
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,920
我打了你一拳
hit you in the face.

275
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,040
打得好
I'm not.

276
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,310
我喜欢打架
I like to fight.

277
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,630
祝你们好运
Good luck.

278
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,920
别那么混蛋了
Try not to be an ass.

279
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,870
你们都是好人
You're both good people.

280
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,550
我不得不承认  你真的很正点  塔拉
I have to say that you are seriously hot, Tara.

281
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,720
多谢  不过我喜欢女人
Yeah, I like girls.

282
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,180
我看出来了
I'm well aware of that.

283
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,440
如果你们在里面遇到麻烦
Say you get into trouble in there.

284
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,490
转身往回走
You turn around.

285
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,290
我们循原路折回到第一条路
We're doubling back to the first road we crossed.

286
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,780
或许在我们找到车之前  你们能赶上我们
Maybe you find us before we find the right ride.

287
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,070
谢谢
Thanks.

288
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,020
我知道你现在的心情
I know what you're going through.

289
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,060
在这一切开始之后
After this all started,

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,790
在我意识到自己再也见不到亲人
after I realized I'd never see my family,

291
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,490
和朋友之后
my friends again,

292
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,330
我麻木了
I was numb.

293
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,680
日复一日  茫然无措
All day long, just numb.

294
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,390
我只想说  我懂你的感受
I'm just saying I get it.

295
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,330
当布莱恩宣称他想要接管监狱时
When Brian told us he wanted to take over the prison,

296
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,940
我就知道不太对劲
I knew it sounded bad.

297
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,770
我找到我女友的时候  她已经死了
When I found my girlfriend, she was dead.

298
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,760
我的外甥女
My niece.

299
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,160
我姐姐
My sister,

300
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,010
她被团团围住  遭到了疯狂的袭击
she was surrounded, pounced on.

301
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,020
我目睹了一切
I saw it happen.

302
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,980
但这些与他对玛姬父亲做的事
But still, it wasn't as bad as seeing

303
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,850
比起来微不足道
what he did to Maggie's father.

304
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,150
当时我就醒悟了
Because that's when I knew.

305
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,350
刀落下的那一刻
That second the sword--

306
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,390
我想大喊不要  但于事无补
I wanted to scream "No," But it just happened.

307
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,280
布莱恩说我们可能要杀人
Brian said we might have to kill people.

308
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,240
我是第一个主动加入的
I was the first to jump in.

309
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,340
我以为只是"可能"而已
I was just hanging on the "Might."

310
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,560
这里没有行尸
They ain't here.

311
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,180
很久没来过人了
Nobody's been here for a while.

312
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,800
最后来的人把汽油都带走了
Whoever was, they got all the gas.

313
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,330
没关系
That don't matter.

314
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,610
我们越来越近了  我能感觉到
We're getting closer. I can feel it.

315
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,990
我要了
Claimed.

316
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,450
我要了
Claimed.

317
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,140
我要了
Claimed.

318
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,820
我要了
Claimed.

319
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,770
我要了
Claimed.

320
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,440
血还是湿的
The blood is still wet.

321
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,680
一定是今天才发生的
This had to have happened today.

322
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,100
拿着
Hold this.

323
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,620
格伦  你干什么
Glenn. What are you doing?

324
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,790
-她不在里面  -什么
- She's not one of them. - What?

325
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,440
地上没有血
There's no bodies on the ground.

326
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,580
这说明玛姬过去了
That means Maggie made it through.

327
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,380
她过去了
She made it through.

328
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,260
我们必须干掉它们
We have to get rid of them.

329
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,500
-没有足够的弹药了  -那就冲过去
- We don't have enough ammo. - Then we'll push through.

330
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,110
我们必须走其他的路
We have to find another way.

331
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,120
你保护他
You got him?

332
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,390
我搞定它
I got her.

333
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,120
得把这车发动起来
Gonna need to air this baby out.

334
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,390
很好  这样我们就有时间找回原路了
Good, it'll give us some time to figure out how to get back on track.

335
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,750
别伤害我妈妈

336
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,320
-别别  -我是导航员
- Yo, no, no. - I'm the navigator.

337
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,630
那就学着导航啊
Then learn to navigate.

338
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,900
记得汤普森吗
Remember Thompson?

339
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,430
我正式要求你对我当面道歉
I'm formally requesting a straight up do-over on that one.

340
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,390
我带领大家
I guided us here from Houston

341
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,260
从休斯顿平安抵达乔治亚北部
to northern Georgia without incident.

342
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,010
我看并非完全"平安"吧
I wouldn't say without incident.

343
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,780
只出了小意外
Minimal incident.

344
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,520
至少路线没错
Navigation-wise, at least.

345
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,320
拜托了
Please?

346
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,630
如果由你来导航
I cannot abide a reality

347
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,860
那让我这个带领大家历经险阻
where you are the chosen navigator over a son of the South

348
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,970
成功走过现实与虚幻之旅的
who has successfully negotiated the travails

349
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,750
南方之子颜面何在
and vagaries of journeys both real and virtual.

350
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,830
好吧
All right.

351
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,270
我们去北方  清楚了吗
We're going north. Got it?

352
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,660
塔拉  怎么回事  怎么回事
Tara. What is it? What is it?

353
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,000
我不能...
I can't--

354
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,610
起来  起来
Get up, get up, get up.

355
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
这里左转
Turn left up here.

356
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,970
才短短五分钟
This is the third left turn

357
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,570
你就让我左转了三次
you've made me make in the last five minutes.

358
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,110
-你迷路了  -我没有
- You're lost. - I'm not.

359
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,240
左转
Turn left.

360
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,130
如果你迷路了  就说出来
If you're lost, please just tell me.

361
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,660
汽油可经不起你这样自负地折腾
The gas in this tank is worth more than your ego.

362
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,740
如果你想谈油耗  我们应该...
If you want to talk fuel efficiency, we could talk--

363
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,730
我们不能关上车窗
We are not rolling up the windows.

364
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,130
-里面一股腐臭味  -停车
- It smells like a damn carcass in here. - Stop the van.

365
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,330
为什么停车
Why are we stopping?

366
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,670
骗子[西语]
Mentirosa.

367
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,350
你是个骗子
Ugh, liar!

368
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,670
不是
Nope.

369
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,820
这不就是你的计划吗
This wasn't your plan?

370
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,820
不然你为什么坚持导航
Why you insisted on navigating?

371
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,660
还让他睡觉
Why you told him to go to sleep?

372
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,540
不  我不是说我没骗人
Nope. I never claimed otherwise.

373
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,640
这样吧  你为之前的诽谤道歉
Now how about you apologize for the slander

374
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,750
我们就算扯平了
and we call it square?

375
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,560
你他妈脑子有毛病吗
What the hell is wrong with you?

376
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,030
如果格伦和塔拉还活着  中途无停顿
If Glenn and Tara were still alive and there were no significant delays

377
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,130
且保持每小时约3英里的速度行进
and they continued traveling at approximately three miles per hour

378
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,390
我已在脑中精确推算过
and I timed it correctly in my head,

379
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,600
他们应该在这儿附近
they might be somewhere around here.

380
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,990
他们两个并非当务之急
Those two are not the priority.

381
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,640
当务之急是将你送到华府
The only priority is getting you to Washington.

382
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,850
等我拯救世界之后
After I save the world,

383
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,900
我不能带着愧疚活下去
I still have to live with myself.

384
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,400
我决不丢下他们
I'm not leaving them behind.

385
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,020
他娘的
Oh! Son of a bitch!

386
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,360
我们为什么停下
Why the hell are we stopped?

387
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,430
如果他们从隧道出来了
If they made it out of that tunnel,

388
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,950
应该会在这附近
they'd be somewhere around here.

389
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,660
你逗我玩呢  是吧
You're kidding me, right?

390
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,430
你怎么回事
What's your problem?

391
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,940
-我怎么回事  -开车的是你
- My problem? - You're the one in the driver's seat.

392
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,410
你踩的刹车
You're the one who put your damn foot on the brake.

393
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,930
是他让我停车的
He told me to stop.

394
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,250
那也不能停车  绝对不能
You don't stop! You never stop!

395
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,710
-我知道规矩  -如果你知道规矩
- I know the rules. - If you know the rules,

396
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,810
规矩就是绝不停车
the rule is never stop!

397
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,350
-如果停下来  -伙计们
- When you stop... - Guys!

398
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,760
-伙计们  -干嘛
- Guys! - What?

399
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,940
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

400
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,700
老天
Christ.

401
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,290
交出来
Give it here.

402
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,680
后退
You step back.

403
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,710
我的半只兔子装在包里  现在没了
My half was in the bag. Now it's gone.

404
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,890
除了你  这里没人
Now ain't nobody around here

405
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,280
会对半只兔子感兴趣
interested in no half a damn cottontail except you.

406
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,280
不是吗
Ain't that right?

407
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,340
只有你还一直惦记着这点破事
You're the only one still thinking about that crap.

408
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,870
-把你的包倒空  -我说了后退
- Empty your bag. - I said step back.

409
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,080
你拿他的兔子了吗  达里尔
Did you take his rabbit, Daryl?

410
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,770
给我说实话
Just tell me the truth.

411
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,970
我什么也没拿
I didn't take nothing.

412
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,580
那我们看看
What do we got here?

413
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,000
出来呀
Come on.

414
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,610
看这个
Well, look at that.

415
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,700
是你放进去的吧
You put that there, didn't you?

416
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,550
趁我刚才出去撒尿
When I went out to take a piss.

417
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,840
-你骗人  -是不是
- You lied. - Didn't you?

418
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,360
你骗人
You lied.

419
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,490
就是你偷的
You stole.

420
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,840
我们要不要给这个白痴点教训  乔
We gonna teach this fool or what, Joe?

421
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,870
达里尔说他没拿你那半只兔子
Now, Daryl says he didn't take your half of the rabbit.

422
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,960
那我们遇到难题了
So we got a little conundrum here.

423
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,050
要么是他在撒谎
Either he's lying,

424
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,920
这是不可饶恕的罪行
which is an actionable offense,

425
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,600
或者
or...

426
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,320
不会是你故意栽赃陷害他吧
you didn't plant it on him like some pussy,

427
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,690
就像某个娘炮无能 骗人怂包的条子
punk-ass, cheating, coward cop, did you?

428
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,500
虽然严格来说  这不算违反规矩
'Cause while that wouldn't be specifically breaking the rules,

429
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,880
但是很令人失望
it'd be disappointing.

430
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,460
是啊
It would.

431
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,190
但不是我干的
I didn't.

432
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,120
好的
Good.

433
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,340
那么
Well...

434
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,950
教训他一下  弟兄们
Teach him a lesson, gents.

435
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,350
他就是个撒谎精  我受够了
He's a lying sack of shit. I'm sick of it.

436
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,730
好好教训他
Teach him all the way.

437
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,310
我看见是他干的
I saw him do it.

438
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,160
你为什么不阻止他
Why didn't you try to stop him?

439
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,050
他想耍花样  就让他耍
He wanted to play that out. I let him.

440
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,170
你说了真话
You told the truth.

441
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,600
他撒谎了
He lied.

442
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,810
你懂规矩
You understand the rules.

443
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,330
他不懂
He doesn't.

444
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,250
看来兔子头也归你了
Looks like you get the head, too.

445
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,720
你走吧  快走
Go. Go.

446
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,170
去找玛姬  找到玛姬
Find Maggie. Go find Maggie.

447
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,490
不行
No, no.

448
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,490
不行
No.

449
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,730
格伦  你救不了我
Glenn, you can't save me.

450
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,240
即便你把石头挪开  我也跑不了
Even if you got this off me, I can't run.

451
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,170
如果你帮我  我们都会死在这里
And if you help me, they're gonna get both of us.

452
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,540
肯定有办法
There's got to be a way.

453
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,080
肯定有其它办法
There's got to be a different way.

454
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,020
格伦  它们过来了
Glenn, they're coming.

455
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,710
我不会走的  我不会丢下你
I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving you!

456
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,220
快离开
Get out of here!

457
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,310
走啊
Go!

458
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,280
不行
No.

459
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,070
来啊
Come on!

460
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,760
来啊
Come on!

461
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,700
卧倒
Get down!

462
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,030
天啊  你太美了
God, you are so beautiful.

463
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,530
情况如何
How'd it go?

464
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,900
隧道那端布置好了
End of the tunnel's secure.

465
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,400
如果有东西要闯进来  我们会提前听到
If anything tries to come in, we'll hear in plenty of time.

466
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,790
我们还没正式认识
We didn't get to officially meet.

467
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,860
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

468
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,130
塔拉  这是玛姬
Tara, this is Maggie.

469
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,070
玛姬  这是塔拉
Maggie, Tara.

470
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,750
他爱死你了
He's a big fan of yours.

471
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,740
我在路上碰到了塔拉
I met Tara on the road.

472
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,210
没有她我到不了这里
Couldn't have made it here without her.

473
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,740
谢谢你
Thank you.

474
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,510
她一听到我要做什么  就坚持要帮我
When she heard what I was doing, she said she had to help me.

475
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
她就是这样的人
She's just that kind of person.

476
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,480
怎么了
What's up?

477
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,070
他刚说
He just said

478
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,930
他知道灾变的原因
that he knows what caused the outbreak.

479
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,900
是的
Yeah.

480
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,460
他知道
He does.

481
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,610
让我猜猜  他让你跟他去华府是吗
Let me guess. He asked you to go to DC with him?

482
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,270
你们能找到彼此真让我感动
I'm downright tickled y'all found each other.

483
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,610
你们今晚应该好好庆祝一下
Should spend the rest of the night celebrating.

484
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,670
因为明天
Because tomorrow

485
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,220
我们八个人没有任何理由
there's absolutely no reason

486
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,690
不登上那辆货车
why the eight of us don't stuff ourselves

487
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,870
前往华府
in that van and head up to Washington.

488
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,010
他说得对
He's right.

489
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,970
我会去的
I'm gonna go.

490
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,490
不  他错了
No, he's wrong.

491
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,160
我们走了休斯顿到华府55%的路程
We're 55% of the way from Houston to Washington.

492
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,490
之前我们有装甲军车
Up until now, we've had an armored military vehicle

493
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,900
但还失去了八个人
for transport and we lost eight people.

494
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,150
-这不是我们的错  -他们死了
- That wasn't our fault. - They're gone.

495
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,740
开着那辆捡到的货车
I can't imagine we'd have better luck

496
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,810
我们的运气会更糟
with that grocery grabber we picked up.

497
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,010
离终点站步行只需一天
We're a day's walk from Terminus.

498
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,650
谁知道他们那里有什么
Who knows what they've got there?

499
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,340
听着  去看看也没坏处
Look, it couldn't hurt to check.

500
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,080
补充一些补给
Load up on supplies,

501
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,230
说不定还能
maybe even

502
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,180
招募他们的一些人跟我们走
recruit some of them to come with.

503
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,850
我跟你们去
I'll go with you guys,

504
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,010
之后再去
but after.

505
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,710
我要先去终点站看看
I have to see Terminus.

506
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,730
我哥哥可能在那里
My brother could be there.

507
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,180
我必须知道
I got to know.

508
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,230
我也是
Me, too.

509
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,010
两个原因都有
On both counts.

510
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,500
如果他说我是错的
He tells me I'm wrong...

511
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,020
我会听
I listen.

512
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,700
明天我们去终点站
Tomorrow we go to the end of the line.

513
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,260
然后去华府
Then Washington.

514
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,570
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

515
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,840
我知道  我们当时也在那里
I know. We were right over there.

516
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,760
冲来了一群行尸
A whole swarm of them came at us.

517
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,050
我们的弹药不够
And we didn't have enough bullets.

518
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,360
我试着想象你在这里会怎么做
I tried to think what you would do if you were here.

519
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,530
于是我对着房顶扫射
So I just emptied my clip into the ceiling

520
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,390
希望有奇迹发生
and I hoped for the best.

521
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,980
太夸张了
That's unreal.

522
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,940
就像你让他们别去拯救世界
Kind of like asking those guys to hold off

523
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,340
而是跟你去找妻子吗
saving the world while you go look for your wife?

524
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,290
我很有说服力
I'm a persuasive guy.

525
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,860
是啊
Yeah.

526
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,840
你在做什么
Whoa, hey. What are you doing?

527
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,590
抱歉
Sorry.

528
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,710
我只有你这一张照片
This is the only picture I have of you.

529
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,220
你不需要我的照片
You don't need a picture of me.

530
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,440
再也不需要了
You never will again.

531
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,380
私酿威士忌
White Lightning.

532
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,790
做法简单  用料很少
Easiest thing to make with the least amount of supplies.

533
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,610
我建议你慢点喝
I'd start slow if I was you.

534
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,860
你的胃可能比你想的更空
Your stomach's probably emptier than you think.

535
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,030
在一切崩溃之后
I ain't been lit at dawn since

536
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,900
我还没一大早喝醉过
before everything fell apart.

537
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,210
崩溃  我从来不这么想
Fell apart. I never looked at it like that.

538
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,070
我倒是觉得一切都有意义了
Seems to me like things are finally starting to fall together.

539
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,450
至少对我们这样的人而言
At least for guys like us.

540
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,920
像这样生活  求生存
Living like this, surviving.

541
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,860
我们以前就是这么做的  对吗
We've been doing this from the start, right?

542
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,930
更近了
Getting closer.

543
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,580
你之前见过吗
You seen this before?

544
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,970
是的
Oh, yeah.

545
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,530
我告诉你  这是个谎言
I'll tell you what it is. It's a lie.

546
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,030
根本没有能容纳所有人的避难所
Ain't no sanctuary for all.

547
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,530
反正不会欢迎你我这样的人
Ain't gonna welcome guys like you and me with open arms.

548
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,500
那我们是要去那里吗
So is that where we're headed?

549
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,270
现在想起来问了
So now you're asking?

550
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,270
是的
That's right.

551
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,930
我们当时在一栋房子里  没招谁惹谁
We were in a house minding our own business

552
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,900
结果有一个操蛋的人渣躲在房子里
and this walking piece of fecal matter was hiding in the home.

553
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,220
勒死了我们的同伴卢  让他变成了行尸
Strangled our colleague Lou and left him to turn.

554
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,650
卢袭击了我们所有人
Lou came at all of us.

555
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,330
他跑掉了
He lit out.

556
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,100
我们追踪他到了这些轨道上
We tracked him to these tracks,

557
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,660
看到这样的标志  然后决定去那里
one of those signs, and thus we've got a destination in mind.

558
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,020
你看到他的脸了吗
You see his face?

559
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,540
只有托尼看见了
Only Tony.

560
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,370
足够找他算账了
That's enough for a reckoning.

561
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,830
我要了
Claimed.

562
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,850
?Be not so nervous

563
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,740
?Be not so frail

564
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,420
?Someone watches you, you will not fail

565
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:50,020
终点站

566
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,210
?Be not so nervous, be not so frail

567
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,340
?Be not so nervous, be not so frail

568
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,670
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

569
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,700
?You must forget them now, it's done

570
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,840
?When you wake up

571
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,710
?You'll find that you can run

572
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,940
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

573
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,150
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

574
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,300
终点站

575
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,790
?Be not so fearful

576
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,780
?Be not so pale

577
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,930
?Someone watches you

578
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:41,320
放下武器  你会得到款待
你已到达终点站

579
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,000
?You will not leave the rails

580
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,200
?Be not so fearful, be not so pale

581
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,160
?Be not so fearful, be not so pale

582
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,780
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

583
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,550
?You must forget them now, it's done

584
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,890
?And when you wake up

585
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,690
?You'll find that you can run

586
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,090
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

587
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,930
?Be not so sorry for what you've done

588
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,280
我叫玛丽
I'm Mary.

589
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,110
看来你们在外面漂泊很久了
Looks like you've been on the road a while.

590
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,600
是的
We have.

591
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,130
我来把你们安顿好  给你们做点东西吃
Let's get you settled and we'll make you a plate.

592
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,560
