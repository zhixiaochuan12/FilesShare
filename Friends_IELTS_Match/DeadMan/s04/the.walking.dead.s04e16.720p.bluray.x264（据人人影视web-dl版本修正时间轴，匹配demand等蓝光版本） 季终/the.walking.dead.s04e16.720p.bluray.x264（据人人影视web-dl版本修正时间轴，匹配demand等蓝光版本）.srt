15
15.

31

28
28.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,720
好吧  有一阵子了
Yeah. Well, it's been a while.

33
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,260
我去看看圈套
I'm gonna go check the snares.

34
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,360
我能和你一起去吗
Can I go with you?

35
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,720
不然你怎么学技术呢
Well, how else are you gonna learn?

36
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,240
你也来
Hey, you, too.

37
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,620
我们再待一两天
We'll stay another day or two.

38
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,990
休息会儿
Get some more rest.

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,820
痊愈了吗
Finish healing up?

40
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,400
我快痊愈了
I'm almost there.

41
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,400
我们很近了  对吧
We're close now, right?

42
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,120
离终点站吗
To Terminus?

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,920
-是的  -很近了
- Yeah. - We are.

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,220
到那里后
When we get there,

45
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,710
我们要告诉他们吗
are we gonna tell them?

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,260
告诉他们什么
Tell them what?

47
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,060
我们经历的一切
Everything that's happened to us.

48
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,180
做过的一切
All the stuff we've done.

49
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,040
我们要告诉他们真相吗
Are we gonna tell them the truth?

50
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,390
我们要告诉他们我们是谁
We're gonna tell them who we are.

51
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,010
但你要怎么说呢  我是说...
But how do you say that? I mean...

52
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,630
我们到底是谁
who are we?

53
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,310
有了
There you go.

54
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,620
是只小的
It's a small one.

55
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,660
也能凑合
It'll do.

56
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,640
这是个简单的活结
So, this is just a simple slipknot.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,410
在绳子的两头打结
Tie one on both ends,

58
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,420
然后把一端系在树枝上
then you tighten one side to a branch.

59
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,420
你能看到这地面
Now, you see how the ground here

60
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,880
有点像漏斗形的
is sort of like a funnel shape?

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,030
-这是条小路吗  -对
- It's a trail? - That's right.

62
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,410
你要把套索放在这里
That's where you want to set the noose.

63
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,910
用叶子遮住
So you hide it with leaves.

64
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,810
在旁边摆上木棍
Then you put sticks all around it

65
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,590
经过的动物必须走这条路
so any animals going by have to run this way

66
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,110
刚好踩中圈套
right into the trap.

67
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,520
救命
Help!

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,420
-快救命  -卡尔
- Somebody help! - Carl.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,410
-卡尔  停下  卡尔  -后退  后退
- Carl, stop! Carl! - Get back! Back!

70
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,840
救命
Help!

71
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,920
走开  后退
Get away! Get back!

72
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,530
救命  来人救救我
Help! Somebody help!

73
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,430
救救我
Help me!

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,530
走开
Get away!

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,830
不
No!

76
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,090
走开
Get away!

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,680
-救命  来人救救我  -我们救不了他
- Help! Somebody help! - We can't help him.

78
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,300
不要  不要
No! No! No! No!

79
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,210
我们得走了
We've got to go.

80
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,510
早
Morning.

81
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,600
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

82
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,750
是啊  只是想要人帮点忙
Yeah, just want a little help with something.

83
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,270
几点了
What time is it?

84
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,260
我已经没有时间概念了
I never know what time it is anymore.

85
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,670
自从我把表给了格伦以后
Ever since I gave Glenn my watch,

86
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,510
对我来说都是当下时刻
it's always right now to me.

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,270
是早上
It's early.

88
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,700
进来吧
He's decent.

89
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,040
-早  -早
- Morning. - Morning.

90
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,770
贝丝会照看朱迪思
Bethy's gonna take Judith.

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,610
我们要干嘛去
What are we doing?

92
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,070
待会儿你就知道了
You'll see.

93
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,500
你用不上那个
You're not going to need that.

94
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,350
枪只会碍事儿
It'll just get in the way.

95
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,030
走吧
Let's go.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,980
这条路上可能会有房子
Thought maybe there'd be some houses down this way.

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,180
可能有商店
Maybe even a store.

98
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,530
这周围总会有点吃的
There's got to be some food around here somewhere.

99
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,420
看啊
Hey, look.

100
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,510
这兔子太小了
That was one small rabbit.

101
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,350
至少有吃的
It was something.

102
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,700
我们得感谢它
Got to hand it to the thing.

103
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,670
味道好极了
It traveled well.

104
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,270
似乎现在我们只会谈这一个话题
Have you noticed that's all we talk about anymore?

105
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,390
食物
Food.

106
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,830
我都忘了风餐露宿的感觉了
I forgot what this feels like.

107
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,600
我也是
Me, too.

108
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,860
希望我们能尽快再次忘记
I hope we're able to forget again soon.

109
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,750
我们快到了
We're close.

110
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,800
再坚持一天就好
Just got to make it through another day.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,100
既然那里的人在收人
If folks there are taking people in,

112
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,050
他们一定很强大
they have to be strong.

113
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,870
他们一定有一套体系
They have to have a system.

114
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,700
也不知道是真是假
I wonder if the whole thing's legit.

115
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,120
我们就收过人
We let people in.

116
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,920
确实
We did.

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,190
总督也是
So did the Governor.

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,380
是啊  总是如此  对吧
Yeah, it's always the same, isn't it?

119
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,590
最后才会知道真相
Don't get to know until we know.

120
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,800
可能这个地方都不存在了
Maybe this place isn't even there anymore.

121
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
哎呦喂
Oh, dearie me.

122
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,130
你死定了  混蛋
You screwed up, asshole.

123
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,210
你听见了吗  你死定了
You hear me? You screwed up.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,790
今天是算账的日子  先生
Today is a day of reckoning, sir.

125
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,100
了结恩怨
Restitution.

126
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,690
整个宇宙又会回到平衡的状态
A balancing of the whole damn universe.

127
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,140
还好在新年前夜
Shit, and I was thinking of turning in for the night

128
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,900
我没有着急睡觉
on New Year's Eve.

129
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,900
谁跟我一起来倒数新年
Now who's gonna count down the ball dropper with me, huh?

130
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,250
十
10 Mississippi.

131
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,520
九
Nine Mississippi.

132
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,720
-八  -乔
- Eight Mississippi. - Joe!

133
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,940
-等等  -我刚数到八  达里尔
- Hold up. - You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.

134
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,210
等等
Just hold up.

135
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,730
这个人把卢杀死了  没什么好谈的
This is the guy that killed Lou, so we got nothing to talk about.

136
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,810
现在我们最不缺的就是时间
The thing about nowadays is we got nothing but time.

137
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,220
你有什么要说的  达里尔
Say your piece, Daryl.

138
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,500
这些人
These people,

139
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,010
你放他们走
you're gonna let 'em go.

140
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,610
他们是好人
These are good people.

141
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,170
我觉得卢不会同意这一点
Now, I think Lou would disagree with you on that.

142
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,940
当然了  我得替他说话  因为
I'll, of course, have to speak for him and all

143
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,670
你的朋友在厕所里把他勒死了
'cause your friend here strangled him in a bathroom.

144
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,660
你想要报仇  我明白
You want blood, I get it.

145
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,800
那就冲我来吧
Take it from me, man.

146
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,410
来吧
Come on.

147
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,960
这男的杀了我们的朋友
This man killed our friend.

148
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,180
你却说他是个好人
You say he's good people.

149
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,520
看见没  这就是一个谎言
See, now that right there is a lie.

150
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,980
是个谎言
It's a lie!

151
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,080
-拜托  -不
- Come on. - No!

152
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,160
教训他  伙计们  好好教训他
Teach him, fellas. Teach him all the way.

153
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,810
-不要  -过来  小正太
- No! - Come here, boy.

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,150
你放开他
You leave him be!

155
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,340
等下就轮到你了  好好等着吧
You'll get yours. You just wait your turn.

156
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,300
听着  是我干的  只有我
Listen, it was me. It was just me.

157
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,450
瞧  这就对了  这才他妈不是谎言
See, now that's right. That's not some damn lie.

158
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,420
我们能解决这个的  我们是通情达理的人
Look, we can settle this. We're reasonable men.

159
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,750
首先  我们要把达里尔打死
First, we're gonna beat Daryl to death.

160
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,190
然后我们再处理那个女的
Then we'll have the girl.

161
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,900
之后处理那个男孩
Then the boy.

162
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,460
最后我把你杀了  这样我们就扯平了
Then I'm gonna shoot you and then we'll be square.

163
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,240
放开他
Let him go.

164
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,710
别扭了
Stop your squirming.

165
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,430
放开他
Let him go.

166
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,800
我制住他了
I got him.

167
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,350
现在情况要严重得多了
Oh, it's gonna be so much worse now.

168
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,800
来吧  起来
Come on, get up!

169
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,270
来吧  让我看看你有啥本事
Come on. Let's see what you got.

170
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,110
-放开他  不然我就...  -过来
- Get away from him before I-- - Huh? Right over here.

171
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,810
我看你能怎样  蠢货
What the hell are you gonna do now, sport?

172
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,830
我会杀了他的
I'll kill him.

173
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,240
我会...我会杀了他的
I'll-- I'll kill him!

174
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,630
放开那男孩
Let the boy go.

175
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,930
他是我的
He's mine.

176
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,310
别过来  别...求你...
Stay back. Stay-- please--

177
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,050
就这儿
Here.

178
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,190
是什么
What is?

179
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,390
那些林子里的野猪
Those feral pigs in the forest,

180
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,780
很容易驯养
it doesn't take much to domesticate them.

181
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,920
就和我们见过的那些马一样
Same with the horses we've seen.

182
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,100
我们有种子  我们能自己种粮食
We have seeds. We can grow our own food.

183
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,600
是时候开始种地了
It's time we started planting.

184
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,490
好的
Okay.

185
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,560
我自己可搞不定
Can't do it myself.

186
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,540
我得到那边去
I got to go out there.

187
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,190
去外面找补给  去围栏那儿帮忙
Go on runs, be at the fences.

188
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,730
我教你怎么务农
I teach you how to do this.

189
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,720
然后你去教卡尔
You teach Carl.

190
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,210
我们会在这里待上一阵子的
We're going to be here a while.

191
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,910
他们需要我
They need me.

192
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,210
我们已经到这里两个月了
We've been here two months.

193
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,790
你把这里运营了起来
You've made it work.

194
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,980
战争已经结束了  瑞克
The war is over, Rick.

195
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,880
不  这我们可不知道
No, we don't know that.

196
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,230
我是在说你的事
I'm talking about you.

197
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,380
我要说出来
I'm saying it,

198
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,420
我要说清楚
and I'm saying this,

199
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,880
你不让卡尔出去  这很好
you pull Carl back from going out there, fine.

200
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,490
-他射杀了那个男孩  -是的  我知道
- He shot that boy. - Yeah, I know.

201
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,750
他需要他的父亲
He needs his father.

202
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,100
他需要他的父亲给他指明道路
He needs his father to show him the way.

203
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,760
你要给他指明什么样的道路呢
What way are you going to show him?

204
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,990
他会用枪
He can shoot,

205
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,500
我们都知道
we know that.

206
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,850
但他今后的人生怎么过
What's his life going to be?

207
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,980
你又怎么过
What's yours?

208
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,210
这一切
All this.

209
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,960
我之所以对你说这些
I'm just saying everything

210
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,960
是因为我亏欠你
because I owe you.

211
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,650
我们大家都亏欠你
We all owe you.

212
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,330
我们可以把这里变好
We can make this better now.

213
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,400
这里变好
Things changing in here

214
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,350
外面又不会变好
doesn't change things out there.

215
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,540
确实
No, it doesn't.

216
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,580
但此时此刻  我们身处这里
But we're here today, right now.

217
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,450
这是重新开始的好机会
This is a good place to start.

218
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,230
马上要外出了
There's a run soon.

219
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,930
我必须走了
I got to go.

220
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,260
不  你不必
No, you don't.

221
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,370
省点水留着喝吧
We should save it to drink.

222
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,270
你看不到自己  他可以看到
You can't see yourself, he can.

223
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,480
我不知道他们是什么样的人
I didn't know what they were.

224
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,010
你怎么会跟他们在一起
How'd you wind up with them?

225
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,560
我和贝丝在一起
I was with Beth.

226
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,980
我们逃了出来
We got out together.

227
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,130
一起待了一段时间
I was with her for a while.

228
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,970
她死了吗
Is she dead?

229
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,890
她只是不见了
She's just gone.

230
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,160
在那之后
After that,

231
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,620
他们就找到了我
that's when they found me.

232
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,010
我知道他们很坏  但
I mean, I knew they were bad,but ...

233
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,910
他们有一套准则
they had a code.

234
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,860
很简单
It was simple.

235
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,270
很蠢
Stupid,

236
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,000
但挺有用
but it was something.

237
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
这就足够了
It was enough.

238
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,500
而且你孤身一人
And you were alone.

239
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,840
他们说他们在找一个人
Said they were looking for some guy.

240
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,940
昨晚  他们说找到他了
Last night they said they spotted him.

241
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,340
我正在犹豫  我本打算离开
I was hanging back. I was gonna leave.

242
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,040
但还是留下了
But I stayed.

243
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,550
就在那时  我看到了你们仨
That's when I saw it was you three.

244
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,070
你也看到了我
Right when you saw me.

245
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,370
我不知道
I didn't know

246
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,070
他们会那样做
what they could do.

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,310
这不怪你  达里尔
It's not on you, Daryl.

248
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,000
这不是你的错
It's not on you.

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,760
此时此刻  你跟我们重聚
You being back with us here, now,

250
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,810
这才是最重要的
that's everything.

251
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,720
你是我的兄弟
You're my brother.

252
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,500
你昨晚的举动
Hey, what you did last night...

253
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,330
换做任何人都会那样做
anybody would have done that.

254
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,010
不  未必
No, not that.

255
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,940
你失控了
Something happened.

256
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,460
那完全不是你
That ain't you.

257
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,020
达里尔  你看到我对泰尔西做了什么
Daryl, you saw what I did to Tyreese.

258
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,740
虽不尽然  但那就是我
It ain't all of it, but that's me.

259
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,260
这就是我和卡尔依然活着的原因
That's why I'm here now. That's why Carl is.

260
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,490
我想保证他安然无恙
I want to keep him safe.

261
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,890
我只在乎这一点
That's all that matters.

262
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,000
你还好吗
You okay?

263
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,980
是的
Yeah.

264
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,850
我也很好
I'm okay.

265
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,710
我知道
I know.

266
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,910
你怎么知道
How?

267
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,170
因为我也很好
'Cause I'm okay, too.

268
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,970
终点站

269
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,870
我们离得很近了
We're getting close.

270
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,910
日落前能到
Be there before sundown.

271
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,360
现在朝树林里走吧
Now we head through the woods.

272
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,500
还没搞清楚他们的底细
We don't know who they are.

273
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
行
All right.

274
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,680
终点站

275
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,170
大家分散开
We all spread out,

276
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,230
踩下点  打探一下情况
watch for a while, see what we see,

277
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,750
做好准备
and get ready.

278
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,180
别走得太远
We all stay close.

279
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,510
你想跟我一起吗
You want to stick with me?

280
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,330
不必了
It's all right.

281
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,700
为什么不跟你老爸一块儿
Why didn't you go with your dad?

282
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,430
当我跟你说起安德烈时
When I told you about Andre,

283
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,950
你都没问过他是怎么死的
you never asked how he died.

284
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,380
我知道原因
I knew why.

285
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,480
是啊  但...
Yeah, but ...

286
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,770
过程也很重要
the how is important.

287
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,570
我们当时去了难民营
We went to a refugee camp.

288
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,030
有安德烈和我的男友麦克
Andre and my boyfriend Mike,

289
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,600
他是安德烈的父亲
that was Andre's father,

290
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,530
还有我们的朋友泰瑞
and our friend Terry.

291
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,300
在难民营
At the camp,

292
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,300
情况越来越糟糕
it just got worse and worse.

293
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,830
人们都陆续离开
People were leaving.

294
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,860
不再抱希望了
People giving up.

295
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,670
但我没有
But I didn't.

296
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,420
那天我外出归来
I was coming back from a run.

297
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,950
看见围墙已经倒塌
I saw the fences were down.

298
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,090
还听见了嚎叫
I heard the moans.

299
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,790
一切都结束了
It was over.

300
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,840
麦克和泰瑞
And Mike and Terry,

301
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,890
事发时他们喝高了
they were high when it happened.

302
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,890
他们被咬了
They were bit.

303
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,840
我本可以了结这一切
Could have stopped it.

304
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,530
本可以给他们个了断
Could have killed them.

305
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
但我却任由他们尸变
But I let them turn.

306
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,270
我确保他们没法咬人
I made it so they couldn't bite,

307
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,790
没法抓人
couldn't scratch.

308
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,300
我给他们套上锁链
I tied chains around their necks.

309
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
这很疯狂
It was insane.

310
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,830
很变态
It was sick.

311
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,420
我觉得我是罪有应得
It felt like what I deserved,

312
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,030
牵着他们到处走  让他们提醒我
dragging them around so that I would always know.

313
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,880
结果我发现他们还能保护我
I found out that they kept me safe.

314
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,500
掩护我
They hid me.

315
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,370
行尸们无法辨认出我
The walkers didn't see me anymore.

316
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,290
我不过是另一个怪物
I was just another monster.

317
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,380
我的确是
And I was.

318
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,680
我
Me.

319
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,990
很久以来  我活得像个行尸走肉
I was gone for a long time.

320
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,040
但后来安德莉亚让我振作起来
But then Andrea brought me back.

321
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,120
你爸让我振作起来
Your dad brought me back

322
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,010
还有你
You did.

323
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,650
我看见你瞧你爸的眼神了
I see how you've been looking at your dad.

324
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,770
你没必要害怕我
You don't have to be afraid of me

325
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,930
或者你爸
or him.

326
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,360
那天他跟我讲
He told me the other day

327
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,600
他以我为傲
that he was proud of me.

328
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,400
还说我是个好人
That I was a good man.

329
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,980
我不是
I'm not.

330
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,080
-卡尔  -我现在更加清楚了
- Carl. - I know more now.

331
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,230
他想要我成为怎样的人
About what he wanted from me.

332
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,580
我努力过了  但是...
And I tried, but...

333
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,390
我还是摆脱不了这些想法
I still have these thoughts.

334
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,970
我不是他认为的那样
I'm not what he thinks I am.

335
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,940
我也是个怪物
I'm just another monster, too.

336
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,480
以防万一
Just in case.

337
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,630
终点站
Terminus--

338
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,150
火警安全门

339
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,730
抵达就能活命
those who arrive survive.

340
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,690
沿着轨道前进
Follow the tracks to the point

341
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,020
走到轨道交汇点
where all lines intersect.

342
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,810
十字路口处有地图
There are maps at the crossings

343
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,010
为你指明道路
to help guide you with your journey.

344
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
避难所欢迎你
Sanctuary for all.

345
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,840
社区欢迎你
Community for all.

346
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,260
抵达就能活命
Those who arrive survive.

347
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,650
终点站  避难所和社区
Terminus, sanctuary for all.

348
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,190
-欢迎所有人  -你好
- Community for all. - Hello.

349
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,410
抵达就...
Those who s--

350
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
你好
Hello.

351
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,060
肯定是艾伯特在放哨
Well, I bet Albert is on perimeter watch.

352
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,890
你们是来抢劫的吗
You here to rob us?

353
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,790
不是
No.

354
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,600
我们想在你看到我们之前  先来见你
We wanted to see you before you saw us.

355
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,260
有道理
Makes sense.

356
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,280
我们一般会在轨道交汇处欢迎别人
Usually we do this where the tracks meet.

357
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,240
欢迎来到终点站
Welcome to Terminus.

358
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,170
我叫葛瑞
I'm Gareth.

359
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,770
看来你们在外面漂泊很久了
Looks like you've been on the road for a good bit.

360
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,280
是的
We have.

361
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,290
我叫瑞克  那是卡尔  达里尔  米琼恩
Rick. That's Carl, Daryl, Michonne.

362
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,540
你们很紧张  我能理解
You're nervous. I get it.

363
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,970
我们也是一样
We were all the same way.

364
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,320
我们是来这里避难的
We came here for sanctuary.

365
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,120
你们也是吗
That what you're here for?

366
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,250
是的
Yes.

367
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,210
很好
Good.

368
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,710
你们找对地方了  亚历克斯
You found it. Hey, Alex.

369
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,010
这里不如前门好看
This isn't as pretty as the front.

370
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,640
我们倒是没什么可隐藏的
We got nothing to hide,

371
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,460
但是迎宾处比这儿看起来好多了
but the welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.

372
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,600
亚历克斯会带你们过去  问几个问题
Alex will take you, ask you a few questions.

373
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,900
但是首先
Uh, but first,

374
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,580
我们需要检查一下你们的武器
we need to see everyone's weapons.

375
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,360
请把武器放到你们前面的地上
If you could just lay them down in front of you.

376
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,420
好吧
All right.

377
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,840
-相信你能够理解  -是的  我理解
- I'm sure you understand. - Yes, I do.

378
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,950
我可不想见到打你的那人
I'd hate to see the other guy.

379
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,970
是啊
You would.

380
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,430
-他们罪有应得吗  -是的
- They deserve it? - Yes.

381
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,150
只想让你们知道  我们不是恶人
Just so you know, we aren't those kind of people,

382
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,300
但我们也不傻
but we aren't stupid either.

383
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,660
你们也不该做傻事
And you shouldn't be stupid enough to try anything stupid.

384
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,260
只要有这点共识
As long as everyone's clear on that,

385
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,740
就没什么问题
we shouldn't have any problems.

386
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,730
有的只是解决办法
Just solutions.

387
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,680
好了
Okay.

388
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,180
跟我来
Follow me.

389
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,260
这个地方有多久了
So how long's this place been here?

390
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,090
差不多从一开始就有了
Since almost the start.

391
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,830
其他营地被行尸蹂躏后
When all the camps got overrun,

392
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,540
人们开始向这里汇集
people started finding this place.

393
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,900
我觉得这是人的本能
I think it was instinct, you know?

394
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,870
循着一条路
Follow a path.

395
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,130
有的人往海岸走
Some folks were heading to the coast,

396
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,610
有的人往西边或北边走
others out west or up north,

397
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,930
但他们最后都会来到这里
but they all wound up here.

398
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,970
听说你们是从后门进来的  真聪明
Heard you came in the back door. Smart.

399
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,000
你们很适合这里
You'll fit right in here.

400
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,070
玛丽  给这些新人点吃的吧
Hey, Mary, would you fix each of these new folks a plate for me?

401
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,760
你们为什么这么做
Why do you do it?

402
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,100
你们为什么欢迎外人
Why do you let people in?

403
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,800
越多人加入  我们越强大
The more people become a part of us, we get stronger.

404
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,130
所以我们才会设置标志
That's why we put up the signs,

405
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,620
邀请人们加入
invite people in.

406
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,130
这是我们的生存之道
It's how we survive.

407
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,770
给
Here.

408
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,210
不
No.

409
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,300
这表你是从哪搞来的
Where the hell did you get this watch?

410
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,280
-帕特里克  -格兰姆斯先生
- Hey, Patrick. - Hey, Mr. Grimes.

411
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,400
感谢你拿回来了这些东西
Thanks for grabbing these.

412
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,050
我以为卡尔会想要
Well, I thought Carl might want 'em.

413
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,980
它们放在那里
They were just sitting there.

414
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,730
半天也没人玩
I figured it had been a while.

415
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,910
虽然这是4到12岁儿童玩的  但我不觉得羞愧
I'm not ashamed that they're for ages four to 12.

416
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,750
你不该感到羞愧
You shouldn't be.

417
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,360
-卡尔  -嗯
- Carl. - Yes?

418
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,950
卡尔
Carl.

419
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,810
我需要你帮我个忙
I need your help with something.

420
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,090
放下吧
Leave it behind.

421
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,620
什么
What?

422
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,860
枪只会碍事儿
It'll just get in the way.

423
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,630
这表他妈的是从哪来的
Where the hell did you get this watch?

424
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,110
你想要答案吗  你想要别的东西吗
You want answers? You want anything else?

425
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,990
放下枪你才能得到
You get 'em when you put down the gun.

426
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,140
我看到你们楼顶上的狙击手了
I see your man on the roof with a sniper rifle.

427
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,420
他枪法有多好  这表到底是哪来的
How good's his aim? Where'd you get the watch?

428
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,210
-表是哪来的  -别轻举妄动
- Where'd you get the watch?! - Don't do anything!

429
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,100
一切在我掌控中  放下枪
