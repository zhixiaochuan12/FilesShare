避难所和社区欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

120
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,820
终点站
Terminus.

121
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
我们去兽医院的时候
When we were out on the run to the veterinary college,

122
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,760
在广播上听过
we heard a message about this on the radio.

123
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,600
-他们在广播吗  -说了什么
- They were broadcasting? - What did it say?

124
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,050
没听清
Couldn't make it out.

125
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,180
我现在看了这个才明白
I only know because I'm seeing it now.

126
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,130
"抵达就能活命"
"Those who arrive survive."

127
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,230
我们应该去
We should go.

128
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,620
我们不是在找格伦吗
I thought we were looking for Glenn.

129
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,910
如果他看到这样的牌子
If he saw one of these,

130
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,900
就会知道我去这里找他了
he would go looking for me looking for him.

131
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,030
看看这地图  所有路线
Look at this map. All these tracks

132
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,190
都通往同一个地方
from different directions leading to the same place.

133
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,690
太远了
It's far.

134
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,350
况且我们不知道有没有其它的牌子
And we don't know if there are other signs.

135
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,890
你不会认为只有这一个吧
You don't think this is the only one.

136
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,100
这是目前最好的线索了
This is the best lead we've had so far.

137
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,270
上面说是避难所  更值得试一下了
It says sanctuary. That's just another reason to try.

138
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,040
监狱里的其他人也可能去那里
Others from the prison could be there.

139
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,900
比如泰尔西
Tyreese.

140
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,470
有些事如果听上去太美好...
If it sounds too good to be true...

141
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,260
也许格伦看到这牌子后
Maybe if Glenn saw one of these,

142
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,750
想法和我一样
maybe he felt the same way.

143
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,250
他不会的  我知道他有信念
He wouldn't. He'd believe, I know.

144
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,680
那你想怎样  萨沙
What do you want to do, Sasha?

145
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,330
围着大巴绕圈吗
Keep making these circles from the bus?

146
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,180
还是让我们做别的事
Or are you talking about us starting to do something else?

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,360
我们不能分开
We're not splitting up.

148
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,670
绝对不能
That can't happen.

149
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,460
你是想投票还是怎样
You want to take a vote or something?

150
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,920
不必投票
We don't need to vote.

151
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,210
等会儿
Give it a minute.

152
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
真干净
It's so clean.

153
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,020
有人在打扫
Someone's been tending to it.

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,520
那人也许还在附近
May still be around.

155
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,630
把你的脚踝包扎一下
Let's get that ankle wrapped.

156
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,950
看来某人没洋娃娃来玩穿衣游戏了
Looks like somebody ran out of dolls to dress up.

157
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,230
很美的
It's beautiful.

158
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,430
做这事的人
Whoever did this

159
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,730
在乎这些人
cared.

160
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,880
他们希望这些人能有一场葬礼
They wanted these people to get a funeral.

161
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,990
他们还记得它们曾经是人
They remembered these things were people

162
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,250
在一切发生之前是
before all this.

163
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,030
在最后一刻依然是
They didn't let it change them in the end.

164
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,650
你不觉得这很美吗
Don't you think that's beautiful?

165
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,040
来吧
Come on.

166
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,560
玛姬人呢
Where's Maggie?

167
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,920
去拾柴火了
Getting more firewood.

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,510
还在流血吗
Still bleeding?

169
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,420
不太流了
Barely.

170
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,710
告诉我...
So tell me...

171
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,860
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

172
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,390
你觉得我们应该停下来
You think we should stop.

173
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,520
是的
Yeah.

174
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,120
为什么
Tell me why.

175
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,510
为了活下去
To not die.

176
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,020
你  玛姬  我
You, Maggie, me.

177
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,350
才不是因为这个呢
Yeah, that's not it.

178
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,220
什么
What?

179
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,080
我觉得你不明白自己为什么想停下来
I don't think you know why you want to stop.

180
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,840
鲍勃  今早发生的事
Bob, what happened this morning,

181
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,050
是对我们的警告
we get warnings.

182
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,270
我们挺过来了
We did fine.

183
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,780
这是个警告
We get warnings.

184
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,470
下次我们就完了
And the next time it's on us.

185
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,640
格伦可能已经死了
Odds are Glenn is dead.

186
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,410
我们也可能会死
Odds are we will be, too.

187
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,270
这就是现实
That's the reality.

188
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,330
我们只剩六发子弹  而且你还在流血
We got six bullets and you're still bleeding.

189
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,260
那些轨道会穿过一些城镇
Those tracks, they run through towns.

190
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,030
我们在最近的城里找座房子
The first one we see, we find a building,

191
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,050
在制高点栖身
some higher ground to set up in. All of us.

192
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,690
这才是我们该做的
That's what we need to do.

193
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,370
也是我们要做的
That's what we're gonna do.

194
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,390
如果能说服她的话
If we can talk her into it.

195
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,760
考虑一下吧
Just think about it.

196
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,430
见鬼
Dang.

197
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,510
你有收获吗
You find anything?

198
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,150
花生酱和果酱
Peanut butter and jelly,

199
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,510
无糖汽水  还有猪蹄罐头
diet soda, and pig's feet.

200
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,810
标准的懒汉早午餐
That's a white trash brunch right there.

201
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,450
我觉得挺好
It all looks good to me.

202
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,100
等等
No, hold up.

203
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,790
这些东西一尘不染
Ain't a speck of dust on this.

204
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,900
所以呢
So?

205
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
说明是有人刚放进去的
That means somebody just put it here.

206
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,330
这是某人的补给
This is someone's stash.

207
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,940
也许他们还活着
Maybe they're still alive.

208
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,520
好吧  我们就拿一点
All right, we'll take some

209
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,450
其他都留下  行吗
of it and we'll leave the rest, all right?

210
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,650
我就知道
I knew it.

211
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,910
知道什么
Knew what?

212
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,730
就像我之前说的
It's like I said.

213
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,170
还是有好人的
There are still good people.

214
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,690
恶心
Gross.

215
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,300
猪蹄归我了
Hey, those pig's feet are mine.

216
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,250
?夏日的松树?
?Pine for summer?

217
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,860
?然后我们要买?
?Then we'll buy?

218
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
?一瓶啤酒一饮而尽?
?A beer to shotgun?

219
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,890
?我们要躺在草地上?
?We'll lay on our lawn?

220
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,340
?我们将一切安好?
?And we'll be good...?

221
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,840
这里封锁好了
The place is nailed up tight.

222
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,110
唯一的入口是前门
The only way in is through the front door.

223
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,490
你在干什么
What are you doing?

224
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,170
这是我几年来睡过最舒服的床了
This is the comfiest bed I've had in years.

225
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,190
真的吗
Really?

226
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,590
我没开玩笑
I ain't kidding.

227
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,250
你继续弹吧
Why don't you go ahead and play some more?

228
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,730
接着唱
Keep singing.

229
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,750
你不是讨厌我唱歌吗
I thought my singing annoyed you.

230
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,620
这里没有点唱机  所以...
There ain't no jukebox, so...

231
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,050
?然后我们要买?
?And we'll buy...?

232
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,360
?一瓶啤酒一饮而尽?
?A beer to shotgun?

233
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,110
?我们要躺在草地上?
?We'll lay on the lawn?

234
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,680
?我们将一切安好?
?And we'll be good?

235
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,570
?如今我嘲笑着我的无聊?
?Now I'm laughing at my boredom?

236
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,290
?和我失败的尝试...?
?And my string of failed attempts...?

237
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,580
鲍勃
Bob?

238
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,710
别为了我冒险
祝好运

239
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,340
鲍勃
Bob.

240
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,500
走吧
Come on.

241
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,010
她肯定顺着轨道走了
She's got to follow the tracks.

242
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,650
我们还能跟上她
We can still catch up to her.

243
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,080
萨沙
Sasha,

244
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,390
我们还能跟上她
we can still catch up to her.

245
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,920
避难所和社区欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

246
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,540
自从平安地逃离监狱后  你就一直笑
You have been grinning since we left the prison in one piece.

247
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,290
如果活着让你这么开心
If you're so happy to be alive,

248
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,570
那我们为什么还要朝黑暗的深处走
then why are we walking into the heart of darkness?

249
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,300
这和我活着没关系
It's not about me being alive.

250
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,820
那你知道自己为什么笑么
Do you even know why you're smiling?

251
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,400
当然
Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,660
因为我没落单
I'm not alone.

253
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,380
失去第一队人后  我落单了
That's how it happened when I lost my first group.

254
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,460
第二队也不例外
And my second group.

255
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,890
现在我破了这个记录
I broke that streak.

256
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,790
换做是你  也会笑的
You'd be smiling, too.

257
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,670
自我意识真是个好东西
Self-awareness is a beautiful thing.

258
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,350
你哪天也该试试
You should try it sometime.

259
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,550
-怎么  不打算接话吗  -才不
- Oh, you're not going to take the bait? - Nope.

260
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,740
你有时候真跟她一样倔
You're just as bullheaded as she is sometimes. You know that?

261
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,240
格伦
去终点站
\h\h\h\h玛姬留

262
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,300
的确
Yeah.

263
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,010
我正全速前进呢
Going as fast as I can.

264
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,300
得了吧
Forget that.

265
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,810
坐好了
Here you go.

266
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,820
好了
All right.

267
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,220
开吃吧
Let's eat.

268
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,670
别动
Stay.

269
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,090
一条该死的狗而已
It's just a damn dog.

270
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,710
过来  孩子
Come here, boy.

271
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,390
它不进来吗
He wouldn't come in?

272
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,160
叫你别动
I told you to stay back.

273
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,100
是呀  但你不是说有条狗吗  达里尔
Yeah, but, Daryl, you said there was a dog.

274
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,610
说不定它会跑回来  走吧
Maybe he'll come back around. Come on.

275
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,320
我睡不着
I'm awake.

276
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,560
我也是
So am I.

277
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,220
你看见它了吗
Can you see it?

278
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,630
看不到
No.

279
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,360
它这样快一个小时了
Been that way for an hour.

280
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
说不定被卡住了
Might be stuck on something.

281
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,070
晚上的声音真多
There's a lot of noise at night.

282
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,920
蝉  猫头鹰
Cicadas, owls.

283
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,440
它们真是阴魂不散
I think sometimes they go in circles.

284
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,970
当我一个人时
Still, when I was out here by myself,

285
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,400
我总是睡不好
I didn't sleep much.

286
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,780
你现在也睡不好
You're not sleeping much now.

287
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,550
你需要睡觉养伤
You've got to heal. You need to sleep.

288
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,910
我可以试试
I can try.

289
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,700
试过了
I tried.

290
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,000
鲍勃  我们在这里算是干什么呢
Bob, what the hell are we doing out here?

291
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,580
为什么你认为泰尔西死了
Why do you think Tyreese is dead?

292
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,940
-什么  -如果泰尔西活着  他会去终点站
- What? - If Tyreese were alive, he'd go for Terminus.

293
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,200
你很清楚这一点
I know you know that.

294
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,240
为什么你认为他死了
So why do you think he's dead?

295
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,940
你害怕知道他的生死吗
Or are you just too afraid to find out if he is or not?

296
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,410
目前为止  我都觉得你是我遇到最顽强的人
Up until now, I thought you were the toughest person I ever met.

297
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,510
说起来有点怪
Which is kind of weird,

298
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,400
因为你也是最贴心的人
'cause you were the sweetest, too.

299
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,200
说说而已
Just saying.

300
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,540
我要留一张感谢卡
I'm gonna leave a thank-you note.

301
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,720
为什么
Why?

302
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,460
他们回来能看见
For when they come back.

303
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,710
如果他们会回来的话
If they come back.

304
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,560
就算他们不回来  我还是想说谢谢
Even if they're not coming back, I still want to say thanks.

305
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,720
也许你不用留话
Maybe you don't have to leave that.

306
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,750
也许我们可以在这里住一阵子
Maybe we stick around here for a while.

307
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,170
他们回来后
They come back,

308
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,780
我们可以想办法共处
we'll just make it work.

309
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,650
也许他们脑袋不正常
They may be nuts,

310
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,560
但也许一切都会安好
but maybe it'll be all right.

311
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,440
所以你觉得还是有好人的
So you do think there are still good people around.

312
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,640
是什么改变了你的想法
What changed your mind?

313
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,480
你懂的
You know.

314
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,800
什么
What?

315
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,490
我不知道
I don't know.

316
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,470
别哼唧
Don't...

317
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,540
是什么改变了你的想法
What changed your mind?

318
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,350
我再给那条狗一次机会
I'm gonna give that mutt one more chance.

319
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,380
贝丝  贝丝
Beth! Beth!

320
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,120
快跑
Run!

321
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,850
快跑
Run!

322
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,880
贝丝  撬开窗户  拿上你的东西
Beth, pry open a window. Get your shit.

323
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,950
我不会丢下你
I'm not gonna leave you.

324
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,840
出去  去路上  我去那里找你
Go out. Go up the road. I'll meet you there.

325
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,630
快走
Go!

326
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,670
这边
This way.

327
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,900
贝丝  贝丝
Beth! Beth!

328
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,030
贝丝
Beth!

329
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,760
格伦
去终点站
\h\h\h\h玛姬留

330
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,740
她是沿着轨道走的
She's keeping to the tracks.

331
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,450
如果我们加快速度  就能追上她
If we pick up the pace, we'll catch her.

332
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,230
鲍勃  那边
Bob, right there.

333
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,420
高且安全
Secure and high up.

334
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,280
我们搭个东西接雨水
See if we can set up something to catch the rain.

335
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,580
在屋顶上t望  寻找食物
See if we could move from the rooftops to look for food.

336
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,350
在上面种点东西
Maybe even try to grow some up there.

337
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,960
萨沙  我不会停下来的
Sasha, I'm not stopping.

338
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,770
我们就留在这里
We are.

339
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,440
我不会的
I'm not.

340
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,310
她孤身在外
She's out there alone.

341
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,310
她不想让我们去
She didn't want us to come.

342
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,710
她做出了自己的决定
She made her choice for her.

343
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,570
我不在乎
I don't care.

344
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,070
她落单了
She's alone.

345
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,370
我刚到监狱时心想
When I got to the prison, I thought to myself,

346
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,180
时光飞逝  还要多久
"How long? The clock's ticking.

347
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,720
其他人会死光
How long until everyone else is dead

348
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,410
又只剩下我一人
and I'm on my own?"

349
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,550
因为我害怕  才发生了坏事
Bad things happened 'cause I was scared.

350
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,020
有些事未必会发生  我不用害怕
They didn't need to. I didn't need to be afraid.

351
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,920
如果到了终点站  泰尔西不在那里
Now we get to Terminus and Tyreese isn't there,

352
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
并不意味着他死了
it doesn't mean he's dead.

353
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,160
-你不用害怕  -我没有害怕
- You don't need to be afraid. - I am not afraid.

354
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,310
那我们就此分别了
So this is it?

355
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,740
不一定非要分开
It doesn't have to be.

356
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,570
是的
That's right.

357
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,060
我要冒险做件事
I'm gonna try something here.

358
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,580
好吧
Well, okay.

359
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,820
你不必这样做
You don't have to do it.

360
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,760
你不必再孤单一人
You don't have to be alone again.

361
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,350
我不会的
I won't be.

362
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,580
玛姬
Maggie?

363
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,890
该死
Oh, shit.

364
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,840
鲍勃呢
Where's Bob?

365
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,730
去找你了
Out looking for you.

366
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,250
你怎么在这
Why are you here?

367
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,700
我想找只行尸
I was looking for another walker.

368
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,870
结果碰到了好多
Found more than I wanted.

369
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,210
我躺在那的时候
You know, I was lying there

370
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,240
我想起来
and I remembered--

371
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,840
我听见了你在营地说的话
I heard what you said back at the camp.

372
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,380
我听见你说  你认为我们应该
I heard you say you thought we should

373
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,650
留在镇上
be in a town.

374
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,260
你还听见我说什么了
What else did you hear me say?

375
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,070
格伦可能已经死了
That odds are Glenn is dead.

376
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,070
我们应该停下来
And we should stop.

377
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,340
但是你错了
But you're wrong.

378
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,310
那你为什么还在这
So why are you here?

379
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,390
因为我在等你
'Cause I was waiting for you.

380
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,290
我不会放弃的
I'm not giving up.

381
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,490
但我需要你的帮助
But I need your help.

382
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,460
我一个人没法做到
'Cause I can't do it by myself.

383
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,860
就算我赶上鲍勃
And even if I catch up to Bob,

384
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,430
光靠我跟他也做不到
we can't do it alone.

385
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,930
我本以为我不敢求你以身犯险
I thought that I couldn't ask you to risk your life.

386
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,910
但我可以
But I can.

387
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,640
因为我知道你冒险为的是什么
'Cause I know what you'd be risking it for.

388
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,340
不止是为了格伦
And it isn't just Glenn.

389
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,120
我知道你害怕
I get that you're afraid.

390
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,260
的确
I am.

391
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,390
我害怕
I am afraid.

392
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,690
我们可以做到的
We could get there.

393
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,030
我知道
I know.

394
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,030
我们去找鲍勃
So let's go get Bob...

395
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,320
然后去避难所吧
and let's get there.

396
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,580
看看这是谁
Well, look it here.

397
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,990
该死  等等
Damn it, hold up!

398
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,880
他的背心我要了
I'm claiming the vest.

399
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,910
我喜欢上面的翅膀
I like them wings.

400
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,210
别轻举妄动
Hold up.

401
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,700
弩手
A bowman.

402
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,530
我很敬佩
I respect that.

403
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,170
拿着来复枪的人
See, a man with a rifle,

404
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,650
以前可能是摄影师
he could have been some kind of photographer

405
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,620
或足球教练
or soccer coach back in the day.

406
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,050
但弩手自始至终不会变
But a bowman's a bowman through and through.

407
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,960
你手上拿的是150磅张弓力吗
What you got there, 150-pound draw weight?

408
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,620
那东西的速度
I'll be donkey-licked if

409
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,040
能达到每秒三百英尺  
that don't fire at least 300 feet per second.

410
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,490
我一直在找这样的武器
I've been looking for a weapon like that.

411
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,480
当然了  最好能多几支箭
Of course, I'd want one with a bit more ammo

412
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,230
少点污渍
and minus the oblongata stains.

413
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,860
你遇到麻烦了吗  老兄
Get yourself in some trouble, partner?

414
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,930
你扣下扳机
You pull that trigger,

415
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,960
他们会把你射成蜂窝
these boys are gonna drop you several times over.

416
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
你想这样吗
That what you want?

417
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,680
别这样伙计  自杀多蠢啊
Come on, fella, suicide is stupid.

418
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,730
害己不如害人
Why hurt yourself when you can hurt other people?

419
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,180
我叫乔
Name's Joe.

420
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,590
达里尔
Daryl.

421
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,290
?No more time?

422
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:11,250
?For crying tears?

423
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,550
鲍勃
Bob.

424
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:13,060
避难所和社区欢迎所有人  抵达就能活命

425
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:22,070
终点站
