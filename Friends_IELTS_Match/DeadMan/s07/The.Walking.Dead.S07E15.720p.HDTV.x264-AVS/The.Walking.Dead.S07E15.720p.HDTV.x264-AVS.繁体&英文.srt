00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,560
《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead".

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,530
起來  我們救你出去
Get up. We're breaking you out.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,860
我不跟你們走
I'm not going with you.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,190
你命不該絕
It's not your time.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,660
有人為他開門了
Somebody opened the door for him.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,000
我們決定不管怎么樣  都要保護好自己
We decided to protect ourselves no matter what.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,370
我們會一直躲在這里  一直活下去
We would stay hidden, and we would stay alive.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,370
塔拉  你在外面比我們走得都遠
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,830
至少你能告訴我們別去哪找
At least you can tell us where not to look.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,630
當然可以
Yeah, sure thing.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,990
她們有槍
They -- They have guns.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,570
許多槍
A lot of them.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,560
我看見了
I saw it.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,740
什么
What?

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,880
那個團體
That group.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,220
我遇見的女人們
Um, the women I met.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,880
她們有武器庫  有槍
They have an armory. They have guns.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,600
你之前怎么不跟我們說
Why didn't you tell us before now?

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,400
我做過保證  瑞克
I made a promise, Rick.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,530
你會想起你殺掉的人嗎
Do you ever think about who you've killed?

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,250
會
Yeah.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,530
如果計劃失敗  你有心理準備嗎
Are you ready if this goes south?

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,990
不會失敗的
It won't.

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,950
如果失敗了  你不必內疚
If it does, you don't need to feel bad.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,330
我的確內疚
I do feel bad.

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,210
我會內疚的
I will.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,990
塔拉
Tara...

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,410
你不必
you don't have to.

29
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,830
行尸走肉
『第七季  第十五集』

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,410
你得用一塊防水布蓋住
You need ?to cover this with a tarp.

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,800
-防水布嗎  -對
- A tarp? ?- Tarp.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,310
為什么
Why?

33
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,910
你想想
Think about it.

34
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,800
直接告訴我吧
Okay. Just tell me.

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,860
我們需要保溫
We want warmth

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,470
這樣它們就會在冬天來臨之前發芽
so they'll put out shoots before the last freeze.

37
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,710
那樣的話  我們扯掉防水布 
That way, we pull back the tarp,

38
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,890
它們就會自然枯亡
they die naturally,

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,610
就不用一直除草了
saves on all the endless weeding.

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,410
去蓋防水布吧
Get to tarping.

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,390
沒問題  女老大
You got it, boss lady.

42
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,790
等等  你去哪
Uh, wait. Where are you going?

43
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,800
我不是農民
I, uh -- I'm not a farmer.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
我需要幫助
I need some help here.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,430
你不需要
No, you don't.

46
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
我看見外面長著野生藍莓灌木叢
I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside.

47
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,180
如果足夠嫩
If it's young enough,

48
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,980
我就要把它拔出來  種在這里
I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,550
好植株能結40多年的藍莓
Good one will produce for over 40 years.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,050
我們得開始規劃活那么久了
We got to start acting like we'll be around that long.

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,690
挺好的
Cool. Yeah.

52
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,380
就蓋防水布  別碰
Just tarp. Don't touch.

53
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,090
之后我來看看你做得怎么樣
I'll see how you do after.

77
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,670
-我知道你不想這樣  -我之前不想
- I know you don't want this. - Didn't want this,

78
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,810
但我現在開始明白是怎么回事了
but I'm starting to understand what's on the menu now.

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,030
我們可以像這些人一樣躲藏
We can hide like these people,

80
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,980
我們可以繼續供奉救世軍
we can keep trying to serve The Saviors,

81
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,920
我可以時常看見你被毒打
and I can watch you get randomly beaten every so often,

82
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,070
或者我們可以反抗
or else we can fight.

83
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,140
所以我們來了
So, here we are.

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,700
而且跟你在一起
And being with you, well...

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,420
讓無助的恐懼可以容忍了
it makes abject terror tolerable.

86
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,190
我該更努力地阻止羅西塔和薩沙的
I should've tried harder to stop Rosita and Sasha.

87
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,950
如果她們再等一天...
If they'd have just waited one more day...

88
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,160
薩沙槍法很好
Well, Sasha's a good shot,

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,930
羅西塔知道如何照顧自己
and Rosita knows how to take care of herself.

90
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,800
她們也許現在都回山頂寨了
Probably back at Hilltop right now.

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,670
至少我希望如此  我們需要她們
Least I hope so. We're gonna need 'em.

92
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,790
還得死很多人的
There's a whole lot of people still got to die.

93
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,730
你好啊
Hey, there.

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,150
沒事吧
You okay?

95
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,240
能給我點水嗎
Can I get some water?

96
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,830
我該自我介紹一下
I should introduce myself.

97
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,750
我是大衛
I'm David.

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,950
不知道你昨晚是否記得我
I wonder if you remember me from last night.

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,900
你記得嗎
Do you?

100
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,640
不記得
No.

101
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,150
我能原諒你
Well, I can forgive that.

102
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,260
昨晚簡直一團亂
Last night was kind of a shitstorm.

103
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,500
就是我把繩子遞給那些人  把你綁起來的
I was the guy that gave the rope to the guys that tied you up.

104
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,550
我總是帶著一些繩子
I always keep some close.

105
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,320
用繩子能做許多有趣的事情
There's just all kinds of fun and interesting things you can do with rope.

106
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,040
天啊  你真漂亮
God, you're pretty.

107
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,890
如果我給你水喝
If I give you some water,

108
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,280
這是我不該做的事
which is not something I'm supposed to do,

109
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,530
你愿意為我做點事嗎
will you do something for me?

110
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,050
做點你不該做的事
Something you're not supposed to do?

111
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,780
你愿意嗎
Will you?

112
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,690
告訴我你有多渴
Tell me how thirsty you are.

113
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
去死吧
Go to hell.

114
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,890
該死
Oh, shit.

115
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,040
反抗只會讓過程更持久
Fighting's just gonna make it last longer.

116
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,800
告訴你  我無所謂
Which, for the record, is fine by me.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,890
大衛
?David!

118
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,510
你他媽在這里干什么呢
What the hell are you doing in here?

119
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,330
尼根  先生
Negan, sir --

120
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,990
你真覺得我需要你回答嗎
Do you really think I need you to answer that?

121
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,210
我能看出你想強奸這女人
I can see that you're trying to rape this woman.

122
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,780
你想強奸這女人  對吧
You were trying to rape this woman, weren't you?

123
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,460
這是不可接受的行為
This is some unacceptable behavior.

124
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,370
強奸違反了這里的規定
Rape is against the rules here.

125
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,520
我可不想待在允許強奸的地方
I wouldn't wanna be somewhere where it wasn't.

126
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,910
負責的人放過這種事...
Someone in charge who let something like that fly...

127
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,810
大衛
David.

128
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,140
你真的越線了
You really crossed a line here.

129
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,430
抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

130
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,230
知道嗎
You know what?

131
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,780
我不接受你的道歉
I do not accept your apology.

132
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,510
給...
Get, uh...

133
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,680
薩沙
Sasha.

134
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,620
名字真好聽
That is a beautiful name.

135
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,920
給薩沙拿件新襯衫
Get Sasha here a new T-shirt.

136
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,560
很抱歉讓你看到了這些
I'm sorry you had to see that.

137
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,740
繩子的事我也很抱歉
Sorry 'bout the rope, too.

138
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,050
也許有些小題大做
Probably overkill,

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,370
但你昨晚鬧了好大一場事
but you did cause one hell of a fracas last night.

140
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,750
該死
Oh, shit.

141
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,620
我記得你
I remember you.

142
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,220
嗯
Yeah.

143
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
你當時在場
You were there.

144
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,670
該死  我現在懂了
Oh, hell. I get it now.

145
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,930
我得承認
I got to hand it to you.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,070
你這娘們真他媽有種
You've got some beach-ball-sized lady nuts on you,

147
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,410
不顧死活地就沖進來了
coming in all kamikaze like that.

148
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,100
問題是
Big question here,

149
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,860
我需要你說實話
and I need the truth on this one --

150
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,260
是瑞克派你來的嗎
Did Rick put you up to this?

151
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,830
瑞克
Rick?

152
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,310
你的狗嗎
Your bitch?

153
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
不是
No.

154
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,980
不管怎樣  你肯定以為你必死無疑
Either way, you must've thought it was gonna be the end,

155
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,350
畢竟你那樣獨自闖進來
coming in on your lonesome like that.

156
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,120
但事情不會這樣發展
But that's not the way it's got to go.

157
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,190
恰恰相反
Unh-unh. Just the opposite.

158
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,550
這
See, this...

159
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,290
這可能只是個開始
Well, this could be the beginning.

160
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,110
刀現在歸你了
This knife is yours now.

161
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,520
你可以試著使用  干掉我
You can try to use it, take me out,

162
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,540
但考慮到我站在你上方
but considering I am standing above you,

163
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,600
拿著一根球棒
holding a baseball bat,

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,680
那可不是明智之舉
that doesn't seem real smart.

165
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,460
你可以用刀來割腕
Now, you can use it to slit your wrists,

166
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,380
這就太可惜了  但我懂
which would be a damn shame, but I get it.

167
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,270
考慮到最近發生的事  你顯然
You're obviously not on the shiny side of the street,

168
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,020
不是什么陽光女人
given recent events.

169
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,620
你可以坐在那里  什么也不做
Now, you can sit there and do nothin',

170
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,990
等著老大衛復活  咬掉你的臉
wait for ol' David to come back to life and eat your face,

171
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,350
這也很可惜  有些瘋狂
also a damn shame and kinda nuts,

172
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,550
但你有權做出選擇
but, hell, to each their own.

173
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:16,480
或者你可以用刀來干掉強奸犯老大衛
Or you can use that blade and stop ol' Rapey David

174
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,520
阻止他變成強奸犯行尸大衛
from becoming Dead-Alive Rapey David,

175
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,070
自己救自己  加入救世軍
save yourself, join the cause.

176
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,050
我知道我要拿你怎么辦
I know what I'd do.

177
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,010
怎么辦
What?

178
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
我少了個男丁
I'm a man short.

179
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,350
媽的  這個人渣算不上男人
Hell, you can't really call this piece of shit a man,

180
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,640
但依然  我少了人
but still, I'm short,

181
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,770
而你這娘們有種極了
and you got those beach-ball-sized lady nuts,

182
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,000
我想要好好利用你的勇氣
and I wanna harness the heat comin' off of 'em.

183
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,820
有朝一日你可以幫我管理這個地方
You can help me run this place one day,

184
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,950
我們所有人一起  跟著規矩走
all of us together, following the rules,

185
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,020
站在同一戰線
workin' on the same side of things.

186
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,470
從來都是這么回事
That's all this was ever about.

187
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,480
你依然可以選這條路
And it still can be for you.

188
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,620
考慮到我的所作所為
I know it's hard to picture,

189
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,740
我知道這有點難以想象
considering what I did.

190
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,400
但是  薩沙  人人都有必須邁過去的坎
But, Sasha, we all got shit to get over.

191
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,990
花點時間  好好想想
Take some time. Think about it.

192
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,930
無論你的決定如何  都由你說了算
Whatever you decide, so it shall be.

193
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,280
別有壓力
No pressure.

194
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,360
還有  再次道歉  很抱歉你不得不目睹那幕
And, again, I am sorry you had to see that,

195
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,690
雖然我知道你是見過場面的
even though I know you have seen some things.

196
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,220
我只希望你能明白...
I just want you to understand...

197
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,060
我們不是怪物
we are not monsters.

198
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,490
他們把你怎么了
What did they do to you?

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,660
他們在保護我
They're keepin' me safe.

200
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,430
我給你帶了些能讓你舒服點的東西
I brought you some creature comforts.

201
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,090
實話說  這枕頭不防過敏
Full disclosure, the pillow is not hypoallergenic.

202
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,320
關于我該不該過來有過一些爭論
There was some debate as to whether or not I should come in here.

203
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,560
他們說假如我被你攜刀劫持的話
They said in the event of a hostage situation with the pig sticker

204
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,410
我就只能靠自己了
that I would fully be on my own.

205
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,180
我就這么一說
Just wanted to share that.

206
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,610
尼根向我傳達了他對你的招安之意
Negan relayed to me his offer to you.

207
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,680
在我看來你應該接受
It's my opinion that you should accept said offer,

208
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,000
就像我一樣
just as I did.

209
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,520
我知道這是不得已而為之
I know it's a hold-your-nose situation,

210
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,080
但與這里的頭頭做朋友
but taking up with the management here

211
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,110
真的是正確的選擇
was indeed the correct select.

212
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
我曾經認為自己可以勇敢起來
You know, I believed I could be brave,

213
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,600
當一個亞伯拉罕那樣的生存者...
that I could be a survivor like Abraham was,and ...

214
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,990
開著那輛房車駛向夕陽是...
ridin' that RV into the sunset was...

215
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,480
我一生中最棒的37分鐘
some of the greatest 37 minutes of my existence.

216
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,730
但我如今明白那只是一個完全不切實際的幻想
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.

217
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,190
我這輩子最害怕的一次
I have never in my life been as scared

218
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,010
就是那晚在那個林子里
as I was that night in the woods,

219
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,250
跪在地上
kit to the grit,

220
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,400
覺得自己死定了
fully believing my number's about to be called,

221
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,040
然后看見勇敢的生存者...
then seeing it happen to someone brave...

222
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,880
被殺了
to a survivor.

223
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,160
然后那種讓人嚇尿褲子的恐懼
And then the pants-pissing terror

224
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,760
看著那個場景一次又一次重現...
of the rinse and repeat of that very same event --

225
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,630
我...
I just...

226
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,800
我做不到
I couldn't.

227
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,080
來這邊意味著我再不用恐懼了
Being here means I'll never have to again.

228
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,200
假如你答應的話  你也不用了
And neither will you if you just say "yes."

229
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,370
求求你答應吧
Please say "yes."

230
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,500
他希望你能答應
He would want you to.

231
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,040
他不希望
He wouldn't.

232
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,320
我希望
I do.

233
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,310
我們依然活著
We're still here.

234
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,340
世道已經變了
Things have changed.

235
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,570
我們可以隨之做出改變  我們必須如此
We can change with 'em. We have to.

236
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,290
走吧
Go.

237
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,780
-他已經開始...  -拜托了
- He's, uh, starting to... - Please.

238
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,600
走吧
Go.

239
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,730
我還從沒見過你到晱~來呢
Don't think I've seen you outside the walls.

240
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,020
我建這些圍棷N是為了用的
Well, I built these walls to use them.

241
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,150
假如我想吃綠菜了  我可以吃沙拉
If I want greenery, I eat a salad.

242
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,680
那你為什么來這里
Then why are you here?

243
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,490
我本打算找你談談
I was hoping we could talk.

244
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,310
然后我看見你一個人跑出來
Then I saw you come out here alone.

245
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,100
我很擔心你
I was concerned.

246
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,870
你的朋友們呢
Where are your friends?

247
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,890
他們出去了
They went out.

248
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,100
他們在找需要的東西
They're looking for something they need.

249
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,310
你不去嗎
Without you?

250
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,240
我只是好奇  你怎么還留在這  瑪姬
Now, I'm just wondering -- Why you still here, Maggie?

251
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,990
卡森已經不在了
With Carson gone...

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,820
我聽說你要救他回來
I heard you were gonna get him back.

253
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,820
不是嗎
That not true?

254
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,400
還是只是說說而已
Was it just something you said?

255
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,920
瑪姬  你得信任我
Maggie, you've got to start trusting me.

256
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,180
人們都很緊張  很擔心
You know, people are tense, they're worried.

257
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,530
如果我們表現得像一伙
Everybody'd be a hell of a lot better

258
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,100
大家會安心得多
if we could present a-a united front.

259
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,440
如果我們能真正成為一伙  會輕松得多
It would be a lot easier if we actually were a united front.

260
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,400
你說得對
You're right.

261
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,660
我得對合作持更開放的態度
I need to be more open to working together.

262
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,200
我道歉
I apologize.

263
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,470
我從不希望我們之間鬧成這樣
I never intended for things between us to come to this point.

264
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,210
感謝你這么說
I appreciate that.

265
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,620
亡羊補牢永遠不晚  知道嗎
It's never too late to change. You know that?

266
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,870
如果你是認真的  我稍后會找你詳談
If you're serious, I'll come by later and we can talk more.

267
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,310
好
Fine.

268
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,510
太好了
Great.

269
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,240
我還以為很快就能完事
I thought this'd just take a second.

270
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
弄完之前  你能幫我留意一下四周嗎
Would you mind keeping an eye out while I finish up?

271
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,180
可以嗎
Could you do that?

272
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,860
樂意之至
Happy to.

273
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,320
來了一只
We got one.

274
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,450
我來
I'll do it.

275
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,110
我是來保護孕婦的
I'm here to protect the pregnant lady.

276
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,200
不用孕婦保護我
Don't need the pregnant lady to protect me.

277
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,540
你以前殺過行尸嗎
Have you ever killed one before?

278
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,380
沒殺過我就不可能站在這了
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

279
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,410
-沒事  我來吧  -不
- It's fine. I got it. - No.

280
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,300
天啊
Jesus.

281
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,300
好吧  你來
Fine. Do it.

282
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,950
瑪姬
Maggie!

283
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,940
救救我
Please help me!

284
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,330
你沒事吧
You okay?

285
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,500
他以前沒殺過行尸
He hasn't killed one before.

286
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,080
正在學習
He's learning.

287
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,100
他跟我們可不是這么說的
That's not what he told us.

288
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,800
謝謝你救我
Thanks for the help.

289
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,200
你自己抓到的嗎
You catch that yourself?

290
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,490
-那他媽當然  -?瑞秋
- Shit, yeah. - ?Rachel.

291
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,110
我是說  那當然
I mean, yeah.

292
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,110
-我去把它清理干凈  -好
- Gonna go clean it. - Okay.

293
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,890
別出聲
Stay quiet

294
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,060
手放頭上
and put your hands on your head.

295
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,840
在村里時我們就該殺了你
We should've just killed you in the village.

296
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,110
你會慶幸你們沒殺我的
You're gonna be glad you didn't.

297
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,890
你不是一個人來的  對吧
You're not alone, are you?

298
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,960
坐下
Sit.

299
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,480
你想干什么
What do you want?

300
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
我想讓你坐下
I want you to sit.

301
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,230
你好  辛蒂
Hey, Cyndie.

302
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,590
你保證過的
You promised.

303
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,550
對  我保證過
Yeah. I did.

304
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,950
把手放在頭上
Put your hands on your head.

305
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
我別無選擇
I didn't have a choice.

306
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,760
你來這干什么
Why are you here?

307
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,930
我說了  我別無選擇
I said I didn't have a choice.

308
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,250
但你們有  你倆都有
But you do, both of you do.

309
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,350
我的同伴現在就在外面
My friends are out there right now,

310
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,670
他們會攻占這里  希望不必開火
and they're gonna take this place, hopefully without firing a shot.

311
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,170
什么  你們要"攻占這里"
What? You're...you're gonna "Take this place"?

312
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,320
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

313
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,750
我們需要你們的槍
We need your guns.

314
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,750
什么
What?

315
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,330
我們要抵抗救世軍
We're gonna fight The Saviors.

316
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,980
-你們應該加入我們  -不
- You should join us. ?- No.

317
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,810
救世軍殺害了你們的父親
The Saviors killed your fathers,

318
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,980
兄弟  丈夫  兒子  而你們選擇逃避
your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.

319
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,320
我以為我們鏟除了他們
I thought we got rid of them.

320
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
碧翠絲說還有更多救世軍  她說得對
Beatrice said there was more out there, and she was right.

321
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,710
他們回來了
They came back.

322
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,260
殺了我的朋友們
They killed my friends.

323
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,490
殺了我的女友
They killed my girlfriend.

324
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,510
接管了我們  奪走了我們的一切
They took us over. They took everything from us.

325
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,310
我們對救世軍千依百順
We do whatever The Saviors tell us to do,

326
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,160
他們以為我們依然效忠  但不是
and they think we're still doing that, but we're not.

327
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,580
我們打算反抗
We're gonna fight them.

328
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,530
還有其他社區加入我們
And we have other communities beside us,

329
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,960
有了海邊旅館  我們就有了一支軍隊
and with Oceanside, we would have an army.

330
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,550
就這樣嗎
So, that's it?

331
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,280
"謝謝給槍  你們應該加入我們"
"Thanks for the guns. You should join us"?

332
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,270
如果我們聯手  可以打敗他們
If we fight them together, we can beat them.

333
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,260
我們必須試試
We have to try.

334
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,260
他們會贏的  塔拉  我見過  你也見過
They'll win, Tara. I've seen it. So have you.

335
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,590
和我們團隊的首領談談  瑞克
Just talk to the leader of my group, Rick.

336
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,360
只用談談  我們不必攻占這里
Just talk, and we don't have to take over this place.

337
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,410
我們不想那樣做
We don't want to.

338
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,930
我可以示意他們停下
I can give them the signal to stop this,

339
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,440
但是你必須現在就告訴我
but you have to tell me right now.

340
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,030
聽著  我們不只是藏在樹林里
Listen. We're not just hiding in the woods.

341
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,170
我們在做事  我們沒有放棄
We're doing something. We're not giving up.

342
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,320
我不想打破我的承諾  辛蒂  
I didn't want to break my promise, Cyndie, okay?

343
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,680
但是世界可以屬于好人  公正的人
But the world can belong to good people, to fair people,

344
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,850
只要我們有足夠的勇氣去嘗試
if we're all just brave enough to try.

345
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,420
我們不是好人  也不勇敢
We are not good, and we are not brave.

346
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,010
你我都不是
Neither you nor me.

347
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,200
她是
She is.

348
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,970
所以我們才有現在這麻煩
That's why we're in this mess.

349
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,610
塔拉  如果你們拿走我們的槍
Look, Tara, if you take our guns,

350
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,190
還不如把我們全殺了
you might as well be killing us all.

351
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,720
這就是你們做的事
That's what you'll be doing.

352
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,330
我們應該和他們談談
We should talk to them.

353
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,510
不
No.

354
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,290
我們可以試著阻止這事
We can try to stop this.

355
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,710
不  辛蒂
No, Cyndie.

356
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,190
無所謂了
It doesn't matter.

357
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
沒法阻止了
You can't.

358
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,950
走
Go! Go!

359
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,880
武器庫
The arsenal!

360
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,590
趴下  快
On the ground. Now.

361
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,400
手抱頭
Those hands -- Put them on your head.

362
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
拜托
Please.

363
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,860
你的人殺我的人
Your people killing my people?

364
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,760
炸彈安置在晱~
The bombs were outside the walls.

365
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,470
你本可以阻止的
You could've stopped this.

366
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,390
我希望所有人都沒事  真的
Look, I hope everyone is okay. I do.

367
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,620
最好沒事
They better be.

368
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
起來
Stand up.

369
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,850
該走了
It's time to move.

370
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,350
我的腿
It's my legs.

371
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,100
站住  后退
Stop, stop. Back up. Back up.

372
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,400
辛蒂  別動
Cyndie, stop!

373
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,420
是空的  什么
It's empty. ?What?

374
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,650
沒裝彈
It's unloaded.

375
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,860
我們不是來傷人的
We didn't come here to hurt anybody.

376
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,140
辛蒂  給我
Cyndie, give it here.

377
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,910
快
Now.

378
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,090
娜塔尼亞  就和瑞克談談
Natania, just talk to Rick.

379
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,600
閉嘴
Shut up.

380
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,110
所有人蹲下
Everybody down!

381
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,340
手放頭上
Hands on your heads.

382
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,580
所有人冷靜
Everybody stay calm.

383
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,090
我們不想傷害任何人
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

384
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,000
別動  聽我們說
Stay down and listen to what we say.

385
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,720
我們想讓這件事盡量簡單和平地解決
We want this to go as simply and as peacefully as possible.

386
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,500
你們都可以做到
All of you can make it that way.

387
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,130
去那邊蹲著  安靜
Get down over there. Keep quiet.

388
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,040
我們搞出了很大動靜
Now, we made a lot of noise.

389
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,540
所以我們想盡快了事  這樣你們就可以派人
We want to wrap this up quick so you can send people

390
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,010
引開過來的行尸
to redirect anything coming this way.

391
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,620
塔拉說你們這片森林比較稀疏
Tara said your forests are relatively clear,

392
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,270
所以我們不會冒險
so we won't take any chances.

393
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,400
任何人都不必受傷
No one needs to get hurt.

394
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,020
重要的只是你們有什么  我們需要什么
This is just about what you have, what we need.

395
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,610
沒人可以帶走任何東西
Nobody's taking anything.

396
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,940
放了所有人
You need to let everyone go

397
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,230
立刻離開
and leave right now.

398
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,380
離開  不然她就得死
Just walk away or this one dies.

399
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,460
好  我們會離開
Yeah, we'll leave you alone.

400
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,040
但我們要帶走你們的武器
But we're taking your weapons with us.

401
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,850
這點不會改變
That's not gonna change.

402
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,660
你是娜塔尼亞  對嗎
It's Natania, right?

403
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,730
放下槍
Put the gun down,

404
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,680
我們來談談我們可以改變什么
and let's talk about what we can change.

405
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,060
不  馬上離開
No. Leave right now.

406
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,550
米恩瓊  不要
Michonne, don't!

407
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,470
我們只是不想被打擾
We just wanna be left alone.

408
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,070
沒問題  我們會離開
Yeah, we'll leave you alone.

409
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,480
立刻放開她
Just let go of her. Now.

410
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,760
不然我們就殺了你
Or we'll kill you.

411
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,640
我們都不想那樣
None of us want that.

412
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,850
他們想讓我們反抗救世軍
They want us to fight The Saviors.

413
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,020
我們試過  輸了  輸得很慘
We tried that. We lost. Too much.

414
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,650
我們不會再失去任何東西了
We're not gonna lose anymore --

415
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,040
不管是我們的槍  還是我們的安全
not our guns, not our safety,

416
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,140
我們做了那么多  好不容易才來這里
not after everything we've done to get here.

417
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,450
我們會贏的
We're gonna win --

418
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,640
只要有了你們的槍  無論你們幫不幫我們
with your guns, with or without your help.

419
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,510
娜塔尼亞  放下槍
Natania, put the gun down.

420
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,940
殺了我你也會死
You kill me, and you die.

421
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,540
我們的人一樣會拿走槍  什么都不會變
And my people take the guns and nothing changes.

422
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
也許我們應該試一下
Maybe we should try.

423
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,330
祖母  住手吧
Grandma, stop.

424
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,060
結束了
It's over.

425
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,350
和他們談談吧  好嗎
Just talk to them, okay?

426
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,090
還沒完
It's not over!

427
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,340
他們都忘了
They've forgotten.

428
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,690
你們都忘了
You've all forgotten.

429
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,500
你們中有些人真想反抗他們嗎
Some of you actually want to fight them?

430
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,010
經歷了那一切以后
After everything?

431
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,080
我們可以失去槍
We can lose our guns,

432
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,360
但我們也要離開這里去戰斗嗎
but us leaving this place to fight?

433
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
經歷了那么多事以后
After everything?

434
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,830
我必須提醒你們
I have to remind you!

435
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,710
是的
Yes.

436
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,760
我會這樣做  我會死
I am gonna do this, and then I'm gonna die.

437
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
但就是這么重要
But it's that important.

438
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
這是你們的人生  你們所有人的
This is your life, all of you.

439
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,510
想想它是什么樣的
Remember what it looks like.

440
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,480
想想他們以前是怎么對我們的
Remember what they did to us!

441
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,300
你們要看清楚  睜眼好好看著
You need to see this. Open your eyes!

442
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,240
瑞克  有行尸
Rick! Walkers!

443
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,590
所有人起來
Everybody up!

444
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,200
讓孩子們站到后面
Get the children behind us!

445
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
它們過來了
They're coming.

446
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,730
第一班  跟他們站一排
First shift, join them on the line.

447
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,040
拔刀  只殺行尸  只殺行尸
Knives out. Dead only. Dead only!

448
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,800
哪也別去
Don't go anywhere.

449
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,470
所有人  10英尺以內再開槍
Everyone, shots within 10 feet of the line.

450
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,790
就這樣
That's it.

451
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,910
開槍
Now!

452
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,500
不  我們不會跟你們一起反抗他們
No. We're not fighting them with you.

453
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,700
拿著你們的槍滾吧
So take your damn guns and go.

454
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,540
你贏了
You win.

455
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,920
不
No.

456
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,800
你贏了
You win.

457
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,040
叫點人來  清理干凈
Get some people in here. Clean this up.

458
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,110
怎么了
What?

459
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,710
你不會真的以為
You didn't actually think

460
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,400
我會讓你留著這把刀吧
I was gonna let you keep this, did you?

461
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,430
在我相信你效忠之前
You still got a ways to go

462
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,730
你還要走很長一段路
before I'll believe you're fully on board here.

463
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,150
一步步來嘛
Baby steps.

464
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,610
絕不是針對你
It is absolutely not personal.

465
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,900
如果情況調過來
If the situation was reversed,

466
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
你肯定也不會相信我
I'm sure you wouldn't believe me, either.

467
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,450
但是
Still...

468
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,810
你自救的方式
the way you saved yourself,

469
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,190
你剛向我投降的方式
the way you surrendered to me just now --

470
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,490
是個很好的開始
That is a damn good start.

471
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,870
但是  我們還得辦點事  薩沙
But we got to work on some things, Sasha.

472
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,120
不過我保證  我會盡量讓過程充滿樂趣
But I promise you, I will try to make it fun.

473
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,020
實話說了吧
Cards on the table...

474
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,310
一只小鳥告訴我
a little birdie told me

475
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,620
瑞克和你們其他的人在動歪腦筋
that Rick and the rest of your people are up to no good.

476
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,530
這需要改變
And, well, that needs to change,

477
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,890
而你要幫我改變
and you're gonna help me change it.

478
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,370
我們會找到一個雙贏的方法
We're gonna find us a win-win.

479
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,750
什么意思
How?

480
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,140
-你打算...  -我會給你找些東西
- What are you - Hey, I'm gonna get you some stuff

481
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,490
讓你更舒適
to make you more comfortable,

482
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,720
讓你體驗一下我們能提供什么
let you have a taste of what it is we have to offer.

483
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,170
好好享受一晚
Spend the night enjoying it,

484
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,040
因為明天
'cause tomorrow...

485
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,110
是個大日子
is gonna be a big day.

486
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,470
凱爾
Kal!

487
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,540
什么事
Yeah?

488
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,000
我需要你開車帶我去個地方
I'm gonna need you to drive me somewhere.

489
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,530
你最好打個包
You're gonna want to pack a bag.

490
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,300
在嗎
Hello?

491
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,300
我是尤金
It's Eugene.

492
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,410
聽說你愿意加入這里了
Word in the halls is that you're all-in with things here.

493
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,880
現在也許看起來不像
It may not seem like it now,

494
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,260
但我向你保證
but I assure you,

495
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,100
你同樣做了正確的選擇
you, too, made the correct select.

496
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,800
我錯了
I was wrong.

497
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,830
我做不到
I can't.

498
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
我不會做
I won't.

499
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,580
我一直坐在這里
I've been sitting here,

500
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,430
想著我怎么能做到
trying to figure out how I could,

501
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,280
發生了那么多事
with what happened,

502
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,740
我們的朋友們還在外面
with our friends still out there,

503
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,650
還被他們傷害著
still being hurt by them.

504
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,650
我不知道我怎么能那樣說
I don't know how I could've said that.

505
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,620
現在  我陷入了困境
And now...I am trapped.

506
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,440
你必須幫我
You have to help me.

507
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,610
我會的
I will.

508
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,810
我會幫你習慣現實
I'll help you get used to the idea

509
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,310
闡明利害  演示為什么...
and illustrate the equation and demonstrate why --

510
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,780
那是個錯誤
It was a mistake.

511
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,650
我本來準備好了
I was ready.

512
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,220
我知道如果我昨晚沒殺死他
I knew, if I didn't kill him last night,

513
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,490
我就完了
it'd be over.

514
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,520
我沒殺死他  所以就這樣吧
And I didn't, so it is.

515
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,960
必須這樣
It has to be.

516
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,580
你必須給我搞些東西來
You have to get me something --

517
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,580
刀  槍  剃須刀片
a knife, a gun, a razor blade.

518
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,260
為了尼根嗎
For Negan?

519
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,650
不
No!

520
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,920
不管怎樣  他都會利用我傷害我的朋友們
One way or another, he is gonna use me to hurt my friends --

521
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,490
我們的朋友們
our friends.

522
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,820
而我對此無能為力
And there is nothing I can do about it

523
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,860
除非我死了  不給他機會
except make sure I'm not alive to give him the chance.

524
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,320
只要我活著  他就會傷害他們
If he has me, he will hurt them.

525
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,900
我必須死
I have to die.

526
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,740
這是唯一的辦法
It's the only way.

527
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,100
我不認為...
I-I don't -- I-I don't think that --

528
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,960
我知道你不會做任何事阻止他們
I know you won't do anything to stop them.

529
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,050
我知道
I know that.

530
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,120
但是求你了  尤金
But, please, Eugene...

531
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,810
別讓他們利用我傷害我們的人
don't let them use me to hurt our people.

532
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,890
求你了  你必須給我一些東西了斷自己
Please, you have to give me something to stop this

533
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,590
槍  刀  玻璃
-- a gun, a knife, glass.

534
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,290
我不在乎
I don't care.

535
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,830
我必須死
I have to die.

536
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,230
求你了
Please.

537
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,780
我...
I...

538
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,440
我會考慮
I will consider it.

539
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,370
謝謝
Thank you.

540
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,420
我們不需要全拿走吧
We don't need all this, do we?

541
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,570
我們需要
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

542
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,380
不只是我殺的人
It's not just the ones I killed.

543
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,810
我也會想起我沒殺的人
I think about the people I didn't kill, too.

544
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,630
結束后我們會把槍送回來
We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.

545
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,980
我想跟你們走
I-I want to go with you.

546
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,610
我們有些人想反抗  但不是所有人
Some of us do, but not all of us,

547
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,340
必須達成共識她們才加入
and it has to be all of us.

548
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,990
我祖母認為你們都會死
My grandmother thinks you'll all be dead.

549
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,360
你祖母很多想法都是錯的
Yeah, well, your grandmother's wrong about a lot of things.

550
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,650
她人呢
Where is she?

551
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,660
她不想看見這個
She didn't want to see this.

552
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,160
她躺下了  我把她打得挺重
She's lying down. I hit her pretty hard.

553
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,370
感謝你之前救我命
Thanks for saving my life before.

554
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,270
還有另一次
And the other time.

555
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,280
還有另一次
Oh, and then the other time.

556
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,050
也許還有今天
?Maybe today.

557
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,330
謝謝
Thanks.

558
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,420
謝謝
Thank you.

559
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,290
你所做的事
For what you're doing.

560
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,510
不給我們留一把嗎
You're not leaving us any?

561
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,470
不留  回見  瑞秋
Nope. See ya later, Rachel.

562
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,650
你還好吧
You okay?

563
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,960
還好
Yeah.

564
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,490
你說得對
You're right.

565
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,960
我不必內疚
I don't have to feel bad.

566
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,190
薩沙
Sasha?

567
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,410
我在
I'm here.

568
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,860
我仔細考慮權衡了上次談話
I've given our last exchange a good, hard pro/con think.

569
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,620
我決定滿足你的請求
I've decided to grant your request.

570
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,970
用這個就行
This will do it.

571
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,230
這是毒藥  本人親手制作
It's a poison, homemade by yours truly.

572
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,280
攝入后約20至30分鐘內必死
It will bring about certain death in approximately 20 to 30 minutes upon the moment of ingestion.

573
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,670
我相信應該是無痛的
I would like to believe that it's painless.

574
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,330
我不太確定
I am not -- I'm not certain.

575
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,900
我做藥是因為曾有人提過類似請求
I made it at the behest of others for similar reasons,

576
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,250
后來我發現她們給了我虛假信息
only it came to pass that they were feeding me the bum's steer,

577
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,430
于是我懸崖勒馬
so I cut bait.

578
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,110
現在的不同之處是
The difference here is that

579
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,510
我們倆是長期旅伴
you and I have been long-time traveling companions,

580
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,670
你證明了自己是一個誠實勇敢
and you have proven yourself to be honest, brave,

581
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,020
具備完全自我意識的人
and fully self-aware.

582
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,780
我確信我欠你人情
I'm certain I owe you for things.

583
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,330
你讓我幫你找解脫辦法
You asked me for a way out.

584
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,800
我找到了一個
I had access to one.

585
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,590
首先聲明  我完全不希望你死
For the record, I absolutely do not want you to go.

586
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,720
但是聽起來你已經下了必死之心
But it sounds to me like you happen to be already gone.

587
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,740
你沒事吧
Hey, are you okay?

588
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,330
薩沙在哪
Where's Sasha?

589
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,950
有人來了
There's someone here.

590
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,030
慢點  等等
Slow down. Come on. Whoa!

591
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,860
他說他想幫我們
He says he wants to help us.

592
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,840
是真的嗎
That true?

593
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,860
你想幫忙
You want to help?

594
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,620
是的
I do.

595
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,210
好
Okay.

596
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,530
跪下
Get on your knees.
