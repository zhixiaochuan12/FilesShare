我们是能做成事的人
We are the ones who get things done.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,540
我们能找到战胜他们的方法
We can find a way to beat them.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,430
塔拉  你在外面比我们走得都远
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,260
至少你能告诉我们别去哪找
The least you can tell is where not to look.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,290

别这样做
Don't do this.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,170
我们要等待合适的时机

10

枪
Guns.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,600
拿到后我们会加入你的战斗
And then we fight your fight.

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,990
好的

没事  我喜欢
Oh, it's nothing. I like it.

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,330
今晚你来守吧
Uh, you can keep watch tonight.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,610
我们今天会有收获吗
We gonna win today?

19

会的
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,990
我们也需要给那个对讲机找电池
We're gonna need batteries for that walkie, too.

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,760
让它重新开始工作
Get it working again.

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,620
怎么了  笑什么
What is it? What's that smile?

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,060
我们出来几天了  结果只找到
Couple of days out, all we got to show are

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,800
差不多两把枪  几个压扁的豆子罐头
two guns, dented cans of beans,

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,930
和几件球衣

26
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,920
差不多吧
Pretty much.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,010
我们在抗争
We're fightin' the fight.

28
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,640
这样更好
It's better.

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,600
早上好
Good morning.

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,100
如果我再听见关于肥乔的一个字
And if I hear one more goddamn word about Fat Joey,

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
我就要打碎某人的牙齿
I'm gonna smash somebody's teeth in.

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,780
我看是甩掉了累赘
Good riddance to dead weight.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,440
总算没什么狗屁吉祥物了
No more mascot crap.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,980
他们对椒盐脆饼的品位不错
They got good taste in pretzels.

35
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,170
还有电池
And batteries.

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,810
两天了  我们得回去了

再过一天半  今天和明天

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,590
我们可以再出来  我们应该回去了
We can come out again. We should get back.

40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,780
再转会儿
Just a little more.

41
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,450
我们没事
We're okay.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,670
我们没必要现在就找到武器
We don't have to find them right now.

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,240
我知道
Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,080
再转转吧
Just a little more, okay?

45

106
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,550
注意脚下
Watch your step.

107
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,940
也许我们不该在这里待太久
Maybe we shouldn't be up here too long.

108
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,090
我们去看看有什么吧
Well, let's see what we're gonna see.

109
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,090
士兵  平民  这些子弹
Soldiers, civilians, all those rounds --

110
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,630
曾有一场恶战
There was a fight.

111
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,700
也许是行尸
Maybe it was the walkers.

112
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,040
也许是别的人
Maybe just other people.

113
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,860
他们还背着枪
They're still wearing their guns.

114
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,060
我觉得就是这里了
I think this is it.

115
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,990
我也这么想
I think it is, too.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,180
觉得我们可以搞定吗
Think we can?

117
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,630
可以的
Yeah, we can.

118
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,560
你没事吧
Are you okay?

119
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
没事  你呢
Y-Yeah. Are you?

120
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,550
我没事
I am. ?

121
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,200
这是个预兆  对吧
This is -- This is a sign, right?

122
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,720
是的  肯定是
This is it. It has to be.

123
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,590
的确是
Oh-ho. It is.

124
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,180
即食口粮

125
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
它们是即食的
Well, they're ready.

126
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,320
我们吃吧
Let's eat.

127
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,110
我没找到枪
I didn't find any guns.

128
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,910
如果你想知道的话
In case you were wondering.

129
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,820
我在外面找了一整天  一把都没找到
I was out there all day and not a damn one.

130
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,720
一把真枪都没找到
Not a real one.

131
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,870
问题是  我之前有一把枪
Thing is, I had a gun.

132
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,420
我本来打算用它杀了尼根
I was gonna use it to kill Negan.

133
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,830
我都已经准备好了
I was ready to.

134
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,980
假如我当时按计划做了
And if I had done it, like I'd planned to,

135
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,930
如今尼根已经死了
Negan would be dead right now.

136
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,390
没错  也许我也会死  但谁他妈在乎
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead, too, but who gives a damn?

137
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,680
那样的话尤金就不会被抓走
Eugene would still be here.

138
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,330
奥利维亚会活着
Olivia would still be alive.

139
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,330
斯宾塞也会活着
Spencer would still be alive.

140
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,970
但如今他们都不在了  我却还在
And now they're gone, and I'm here

141
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,660
就因为我愚蠢地听信了你的话
because I was stupid enough to listen to you.

142
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,380
但你听了
But you were.

143
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,640
也照做了
And you did.

144
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,220
你就站在那里对别人指手画脚
You stand there telling people about their lives.

145
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,500
只对那些来这里的人
Only if they come here.

146
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,660
比如你
Like you.

147
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,740
就像现在
Right now.

148
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,680
你什么都不懂
You don't know shit about shit.

149
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,690
你说得对
You're right.

150
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
我的确不懂
I don't.

151
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,250
我说过你不应该去送死
I said that you weren't supposed to die

152
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,820
不应该去做那件你计划要做的事
and that you shouldn't do the thing that you were planning to do

153
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,220
因为我们需要你
because we needed you --

154
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,930
我们如今依然需要
still do.

155
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,300
像我这样的傻瓜都能看清那一点
Even a fool like me could see that.

156
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,400
死了的确更容易些
It's easier to be dead,

157
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,850
假如你还活着是我的错的话
and if it's my fault you're alive,

158
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,720
那我只能背负着这个错误了
well, I'm just gonna have to live with that.

159
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,150
我当时决定要插手
I decided to meddle.

160
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,110
但我做的是我认为正确的事
But I did something I thought was right,

161
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,450
我也知道这事风险很大
and I knew the stakes were very high.

162
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,090
你当然可以因为自己还活着而指责我
You can certainly blame me for the fact that you have a life,

163
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,020
但之后呢  你要怎么办
but after that what are you going to do with it?

164
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,150
你要如何促成那些必须发生的事
How are you going to make what needs to happen happen?

165
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,370
在你心跳停止之前  一切皆有可能
Anything is possible until your heart stops beating.

166
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,940
你能做的绝不仅仅是冲着个傻子大吼
Certainly more than yelling at a fool.

167
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,500
美国政府财产  严禁转售获利

168
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,780
即食口粮  
7号菜单
牛腩配肉汁

169
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,290
火鸡胸肉

170
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
什么
What?

171
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,420
如何
How is it?

172
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,350
棒极了
It's good.

173
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,410
所以  明天...
So, tomorrow...

174
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,710
我们出去  把武器抢回来  对吗
we go out there, we get the weapons, right?

175
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,390
然后让简迪斯和她的人跟我们一起战斗
We get Jadis and her people to fight with us.

176
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,700
我们杀死尼根
We kill Negan

177
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,720
以及其他该杀之人  来赢得战斗
and anyone else we have to to win.

178
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,960
在那之后呢
And what happens after that?

179
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,220
之后  我们继续生活
After that, we keep going.

180
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,070
是的  但是
Yeah, but...

181
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,130
尼根用他的方法统治世界
Negan ordered the world his way.

182
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,620
他死之后  我们应该建立新秩序  对吧
It's up to us to reorder it once he's gone, right?

183
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
所有社区
All the different communities,

184
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,810
可以一起想办法  讨论如何继续生活
they can figure it out together, how to keep going together.

185
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,080
对  但总得有人促成这事
Yeah, but somebody's gonna have to make that happen.

186
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,740
总得有人负责  对吗
Somebody will need to be in charge of that, right?

187
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,900
那个人应该是你
It should be you.

188
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,570
-不是我  -为什么
- Not me. - ?Why not?

189
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,740
你可以胜任的
You could do it.

190
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,490
你会做得很好
?You'd be good at it.

191
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,870
如果你想做的话
I mean, if it's something that you wanted.

192
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,650
我不想做  也不愿意做
Well, I don't think I do. Or I would.

193
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,230
但如果是咱们俩  你和我
But the two of us, you and me,

194
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,070
一起重建秩序
reordering things together...

195
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,470
那我愿意
I want that.

196
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,290
假如你也愿意的话...
If it's something you wanted....

197
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,070
我愿意
Yeah.

198
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,940
我要再吃五包这个  好吗
I'm gonna eat five more of these dinners, okay?

199
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,120
知道吗
You know...

200
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,150
我们用不着明天就搞定
we don't have to get it done tomorrow.

201
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,250
我们可以悠闲点
We can take our time.

202
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,960
过一两天再走也没关系
If we go another day, another one after that, it's fine.

203
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,850
我是说  这地方没危险
I mean, the place is clear.

204
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,010
严严实实的
It's locked up tight.

205
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,330
只有一条路能进来  所以
We found the only way in, so...

206
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,750
我们应该回去
We should get back.

207
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
既然能拿到枪
If we're getting the guns,

208
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,900
多费点时间也没关系
it doesn't matter if it takes a little longer.

209
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,420
等等  我一直
Wait. I've been, um...

210
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,890
在等着给你看这个
I've been waiting to show you this one.

211
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,260
这可是  辣椒  奶酪意面
It's, um, chili and mac and cheese...

212
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,410
大杂烩
together.

213
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
试试吧
Come on.

214
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,360
抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

215
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,850
我在思考
I was just thinking.

216
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,660
什么  你要这个
W..you...you want this?

217
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,400
恭喜
Congrats.

218
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,940
归你了
It's yours.

219
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,870
是别人送我的  曾经帮助过我的某人
Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.

220
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,390
她为我不顾一切
She put her ass on the line for me.

221
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,320
她救了我的命  知道吗
She saved my life, you know?

222
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,330
她本来不用做  但却做了
She didn't have to. But she did.

223
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,080
如今这是有意义的  毋庸置疑
That means something now -- it does. It has to.

224
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,580
要是我说了  知道吗
If I say something, you know --

225
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
拿不到枪  瑞克是不会离开那里的
Rick won't leave there without their guns.

226
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,350
就算我们能成功接近那里
If -- if we could even get close enough,

227
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,300
她们也会开火  我们会反击
they'll start firing, and we'll fire back.

228
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,510
她们应该跟我们并肩战斗的
I mean, they should just fight with us.

229
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,860
救世军杀了她们的父亲
The Saviors killed their fathers

230
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,760
儿子和兄弟
and their sons and their brothers.

231
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,910
但她们不想和我们并肩战斗
They won't want to fight with us.

232
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,200
她们只想藏起来
They just want to hide.

233
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,640
所以她们只能和我们战斗
So they'll just fight us.

234
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,350
如果我告诉大家海边旅馆的事  就会这样
I tell everyone about Oceanside, that's what happens.

235
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,200
凭什么我们的命比他们的更珍贵
What makes our life worth more than theirs?

236
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,950
就因为我们想阻止
Because we want to stop

237
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,480
那些伤害我们的人吗
the people that are hurting us,

238
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,250
那些会伤害别人的人吗
who will hurt other people?

239
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,980
该死
God damn it.

240
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,610
看
Look.

241
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,050
行尸在外游荡  没有被关起来
The walkers in the field, they're not closed in.

242
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,700
是啊
Yeah.

243
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,540
我们得干掉外面的这些
We got to take care of the ones out here

244
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,230
把缺口堵上  然后再慢慢干掉剩下的
and block that gap, too, so we can take the rest slow.

245
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,280
七  八...
Seven, eight...

246
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,870
九
nine...

247
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,870
我能用那辆车堵上
That car -- I can block it up.

248
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,460
我能干掉挡路的那一个
I can take out that one on the way.

249
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,650
你把剩下的引开
You draw the rest.

250
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,350
你给我留了八个
You're leaving me eight.

251
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,120
我们可以朝它们开枪
We could shoot them,

252
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,890
但这样会引来其余的行尸
but that would call the rest from the field.

253
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,480
得悄悄行动  用剑
This is about doing it quiet, with the sword.

254
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,300
八个对你来说不是问题
You can handle eight.

255
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,040
你已经干掉八个行尸了  我推得动
You got your eight walkers. I can push.

256
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,550
我也行
So can I.

257
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,240
你只要负责把车开到缺口就行
You just worry about steering us in that gap.

258
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,360
该死
?Shit.

259
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,850
刹车坏了
The brakes don't work.

260
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,230
米琼恩  你没事吧

没事
Yeah.

262
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,910
你呢
You?

263
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,560
没事
Yeah.

264
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,100
我觉得我们开过头了
I think we overshot it.

265
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,950
你觉得还是你确定
You think or you know?

266
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,310
我确定
I know.

267
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,060
不过这是个好计划
It was a good plan, though.

268

这个计划超棒
It was a great plan.

269
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,030
就在这里吧

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,950
好

271
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,900
该死  这拦不住它们
Shit. It's not gonna hold.

272
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,470
过来了
There it goes!

273
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,500
我们散开  减少它们的数量
Split them off into smaller groups.

274
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,440
栅栏也许能挡住
The barriers might hold.

275
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,910
你去滑梯  我去摩天轮
You take slide, I take Ferris wheel?

276
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,500
或者我们可以直接逃

277
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,190
-你想逃吗  -不  我们能搞定
- You want to go? ?- Nah. We can do this.

还剩八个

281
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,760
你呢
How about you?

282
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,810
十个

284
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,430
瑞克

285
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,630
米琼恩
Michonne!

286
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,160
我试过了  但我还欠你一头
I tried, but I still owe you one.

287
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,140
我可以在外面多待几天
I could've gone a couple more days.

288

我喜欢那样
I would've liked that.

290
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,260
想着我们失去了什么
Thinking about what we lost.

291
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,910
想着我的朋友们
Thinking about my friends.

292
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,440
格伦救过我
Glenn saved me.

293
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,220
在最开始的时候
Right at the start.

294
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,880
而我没能救他
I couldn't save him.

295
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,690
这很正常
It's normal.

296
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,150
我知道
I know that.

297
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,010
无法释怀
Being stuck on it.

298
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,360
我们经历了一些事
We went through something.

299
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,730
光这样是不能释怀的
This -- This doesn't cure it.

300
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,200
瑞克  我很抱歉
Rick, I'm sorry.

301
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,100
我们要反抗他们
We're gonna fight them.

302
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,350
这就是接下来会发生的事
That's what happens next.

303
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,870
我们会失去一些人
And we're gonna lose people,

304
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,760
也许是很多人  也许是对方
maybe a lot of them, maybe even each other.

305
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,000
即使那样  也值得
Even then, it'll be worth it.

306
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,600
当我想到...
When I thought that...

307
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,660
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

308
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,660
你问过我
You asked me

309
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,020
放弃算怎么个活法
what kind of life we had just surrendering.

310
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,620
那不是生活
It wasn't -- It wasn't a life.

311
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,290
我们在那里做的事
What we did back there,

312
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,240
我们现在做的事
what we're doing now,

313
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,220
为朱迪思拼未来
making a future for Judith

314
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
为格伦和玛姬的孩子拼未来
and for Glenn and Maggie's baby,

315
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,150
做出抗争  这才叫生活
fighting the fight, that's living.

316
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,150
这是你让我知道的
You showed me that.

317
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,520

我们可以失去朋友  爱的人

321
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,440
这不再是关乎我们了
It's not about us anymore.

322
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,190
是关乎未来
It's about a future.

323
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,540
如果我没能活下来
And if it's me who doesn't make it,

324
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,720
你就必须带领其他人前行
you're gonna have to lead the others forward

325
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,340
因为你有这能力
because you're the one who can.

326
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,750
但是
But...

327
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,540
你怎么知道
how do you know?

328
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,220
因为
Because...

329
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,420
你带我走到了这里

330
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,160

据我说知能

我们清理了一部分  上了油

剩下的你们来  我们是合作关系

336
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,820
好的  但能用吗

337
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,120
你可以开几枪试试  如果你想的话

你是说不要清单吗
You mean the inventory?

342
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,240
-不够  -你说什么
- Not enough. ?What? - Wha-- ?What are you talking about?

343
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,600
你要很多枪  这就是很多枪
You asked for a lot of guns. That's what this is.

344
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
要为你战斗  我们需要两倍的枪

需要两倍的枪

枪是我们的  协议还没结束
Our guns to take. Our deal still on.

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,080
你们不能全拿
Not all of them.

351
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,520
我们留十把  为了找更多的枪

再多等几天
You get a few more days

362
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,040
"接下来的事"就会发生
before "What happens next."

363
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,600
再多等几天
Few more days?

364
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,750

That's right.

365
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,690

今早换岗她不在
She didn't show for her guard shift this morning.

373
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,490
她大概出去找枪了吧

374
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,220
好吧

我来这里是找你帮忙的
I'm here because I need your help.

380
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,150
有一个条件

要由我杀他
I get to take the shot.

382

好
Okay.

383
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,410
你带桥上的炸药了吗
Did you bring any explosives from the bridge?

384
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,410
我考虑过
I thought about it.

385
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,990
但我不想被别人发现和阻止
But I didn't want anyone finding out and trying to stop me.

386
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,110
我带了更好的东西
I got something better, though.

387
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,290
这样你就能杀他了
So you can take your shot.

388
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,310
瑞克和米琼恩找到了枪

But they aren't ready to move.

390
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,600
他们不能
They can't.

391
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,570
她们需要更多枪  更多人  更多时间
The need more guns, more people, more time,

392
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,790
更多借口

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,480
我记下了达里尔和卡尔给瑞克说的
I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick

394
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,040
尼根基地内部情况
about the inside of Negan's place.

395

耶稣给我画了一张外围的地图

400
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,040
你知道吗
Do you?

401
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,960
他们不能活捉我们
They can't catch us alive.

402
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,810
如果被抓住  就给了他们借口
If they do, we give them something.

403
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,600
我们这是有去无回
It's a one-way ticket for both of us.

404
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,970
假如我们都去的话
If it is both of us.

405
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,380
我们都去
It is.
