1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,310
《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously, on AMC's The Walking Dead.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,660
我們有人手和武器
We have people, and weapons.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,800
如果我們聯盟  先下手為強  就能打敗他們
If we strike first, together, we can beat them.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,340
會死人
People will die.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,340
會死很多人  不僅是救世軍
A lot of people, and not just the Saviors.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,640
如果能找到更好的辦法  必須找到
If we can find another way, we have to.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,810
知道如何打架  不意味著你應該去找茬
Just because you now know how to fight, doesn't mean you should seek one.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,820
你只用說服以西結帶領神之國反抗
You'll just have to convince Ezekiel to bring The Kingdom to fight.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,960
不  我不想參與這事
No, this is something I am not a part of.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,300
看上去少了
Ah, it looks light.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,170
也許你該再看看  加文
Perhaps you might look again, Gavin.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,820
我們履行了義務
We've met our obligations.

13
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,760
該死
God damn it.

14
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,520
醒醒  孩子
Wake it up, kid.

15
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,950
為什么非得這么早
Why does it have to be so early?

16
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
今天有很多事要做
Got a lot to do today.

17
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,860
你想繼續睡覺嗎
You want to go back to sleep?

18
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
不想
No way.

19
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,340
你剛來找我的時候  
You said you wanted to be able to knock your brother

20
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,410
說想打敗你哥哥
on his butt when you first came to me.

21
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,780
你真想這樣嗎
That really what you want?

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,580
是啊
Yeah.

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
不是
No.

24
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,870
你想跟你哥哥一樣
You want to be like your brother.

25
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,830
對嗎
Yeah?

26
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,980
對
Yeah. ?

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,360
好吧
All right.

28
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,940
檢查你的步法
Check your feet,

29
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,090
-如果你的步法錯  -一切都錯
- 'cause if your feet ain't right -- - Nothing's right.

30
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,520
我們正打算出去清理...
We were just about to come out to clear the --

31
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
摩根在哪
Where's Morgan?

32
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
-你沒事吧  -摩根在哪
- You okay? - Where is Morgan?

33
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,620
為什么耶穌帶達里爾和其他人來神之國
Why did Jesus bring Daryl and everyone else to the Kingdom?

34
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,600
他們
They, um...

35
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,110
他們想看看我們能不能一起合作
They wanted to see if we could all start working together on things.

36
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,330
救世軍還在
The Saviors are still here.

37
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,380
他們沒跟神之國打仗  但是
They're not fighting with the Kingdom, but...

38
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,930
達里爾說他們在亞歷山大打敗了救世軍
Daryl said they beat them back in Alexandria.

39
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,910
是真的嗎
Is that true?

40
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,510
他們達成了協議嗎
That they made a deal with them?

41
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,850
大家都還好嗎
Is everyone okay?

42
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,120
告訴我是不是真的
Just tell me if it's true.

43
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
你得去問達里爾
You need to talk to Daryl about that.

44
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,340
你讓我不告訴所有人你的事
You wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.

45
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,040
讓我不說你在哪
Told me not to say where you were,

46
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,410
我照你的吩咐做了
and I did what you asked.

47
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,030
達里爾不是靠我找到你的
Daryl didn't find you because of me.

48
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,410
你倆之間說的話
And what was said between you and him

49
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,920
是你倆的事
was said between you and him.

50
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,780
我會跟你去亞歷山大
I will go with you to Alexandria,

51
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,260
如果你想去
if you want to make the trip...

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,510
如果你想跟他談
if you want to talk to him.

53
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
你不該一個人去
You shouldn't go alone.

54
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,950
你找到了想要的  對吧
You found what you wanted, right?

55
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,140
你逃開了所有人
You got away from everyone.

56
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,650
那是你想要的嗎
Is it what you wanted?

57
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,620
還是太遲  已經沒法逃離了
Was it just too late to get away?

58
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,130
我們現在就能去亞歷山大
Hey, we can leave for Alexandria right now.

59
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,470
如果你想的話
Right now, if you want to.

60
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,370
我能幫你什么忙嗎
Is there anything I can help you with?

61
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,440
-不能  -我能不能
- No. - ?Well, can I just --

62
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,590
如果你不介意  我可以送你回小屋嗎
If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you?

63
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,330
不行
No!

64
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,920
我們今天要上貢  但我可以不去
We have a drop today, but I can miss it.

65
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,850
我只是
I just...

66
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,230
我在努力學習
I'm trying to learn,

67
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,670
看到了你之前做的事  我...
and seeing what you did here, I...

68
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,080
有五個行尸
There were five of them.

69
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,870
如果你能讓我看看
I would just really appreciate it

70
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,350
你是怎么做到的  我會很感激
if you would just...let me see how you do what you do.

71
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,930
不行  去上貢吧
No. Go do your drop.

72
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,660
好吧
Okay.

73
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,940
凱蒂

74
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,320
準你上前  娜比拉
You may approach, Nabila.

75
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,940
我待在原地就好
I'm fine where I am.

76
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,040
希瓦喜歡你
Shiva likes you.

77
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,120
我就怕它喜歡我
That's what I'm afraid of.

78
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,750
告訴我你發現了什么
Tell me what you found.

79
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,520
你不會喜歡的
You're not gonna like it.

80
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,930
我更不喜歡被壞消息吊胃口
I like waiting to hear bad news less.

81
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,340
我們遇到了個小問題
We got a little problem

82
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,980
但它一周之內就可能變成大問題
that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.

83
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,280
下面大部分植物都生了象鼻蟲
Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.

84
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,840
我們必須把它們全部剪了燒掉
We have to cut and burn everything

85
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,800
不然會蔓延到院子里的主要農作物上
before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.

86
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,910
我知道皇家花園對你而言很重要
I know the Royal Garden is important to you.

87
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,310
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
謝謝你  娜比拉
Thank you, Nabila.

89
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,610
該怎么辦就怎么辦吧
Do what must be done.

90
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,730
陛下  美妙之處就在于...
Here's the beautiful thing, Your Majesty --

91
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,260
你可以把它們拔了剪了
you can tear it out and cut it down.

92
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,440
你可以把它們燒了扔掉
You can burn it and throw it all away.

93
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,060
但如果你想的話  它們還會再長回來
But if you want, it can all grow back.

94
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,750
好吧  我覺得我尿褲子了
Okay. I think I just pissed myself.

95
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,900
我得走了
I'm-a gonna go.

96
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,890
五分鐘后出發
We're at "five minutes go."

97
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,180
好
Okay.

98
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,480
謝謝你給了我這本書
Thank you for this.

99
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,320
我還在思考
I'm still thinking about it.

100
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,380
"傷害敵人就是傷害自己"
"To injure an opponent is to injure oneself."

101
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,390
無論如何都會受傷是吧
Get injured no matter what.

102
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,370
我給你帶了件禮物  放在你新家的
I got something for you -- for the new place.

103
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,020
謝了
Thanks.

104
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,840
我出去找物資時在一家餐廳里發現的
I found it at a restaurant I was scavenging.

105
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,550
我認識一個女孩  她幫我把它修好了
I know a girl, and she, uh, fixed it up for me.

106
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,540
瞧
There.

107
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,140
我正好看那釘子看煩了呢
I was getting tired of looking at that nail.

108
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,970
那個女孩是誰
So, who's the girl?

109
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,690
我們還有三分鐘就要出發了
We're at, like, "three minutes go" right now,

110
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,470
所以...
so...

111
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,000
那孩子小小年紀就得當爹
Kid's too young to be a father.

112
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,210
你當過爹嗎
Were you one?

113
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
當過  謝天謝地
I was, thank God.

114
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,850
但我那時可不小
But I wasn't too young --

115
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,290
完美的年紀  完美的時間
perfect age, perfect time.

116
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,150
我有完美的家庭和完美的人生
I had myself the perfect family and the perfect life.

117
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,050
我所求不多  得到的卻超過預期
I didn't ask for much, and I got more than I deserved.

118
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,790
你呢
And you?

119
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,760
很抱歉我倆之間有些不快
I'm sorry for how things have been between you and me.

120
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,510
我覺得你對殺戮的看法是錯的
I think you're wrong about killing...

121
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,430
覺得我們能和救世軍長期共處的想法也是錯的
about how you think things can last like this with the Saviors.

122
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,110
但我還是得道歉
But I'm sorry.

123
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,430
我知道你是個好人
I know you're a good man.

124
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,380
但總有一天  你不能再這樣好下去
The day's coming where you can't be that good.

125
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,710
等到那時
When that happens,

126
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,370
別為此自責
don't beat yourself up about it.

127
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,190
本杰明  我們該出發了
Benjamin, it's time for us to take our leave.

128
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,880
再見  小伙子
See you, little man.

129
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,660
把餡餅放下
Leave the cobbler.

130
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,840
真要這樣嗎
Really?

131
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,690
杰瑞
Jerry.

132
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,710
好吧
Fine.

133
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,480
那女孩是誰
Who's the girl?

134
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,450
大家都別動  把槍端好
Everyone stay down. Get your guns up.

135
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,790
有人把路堵上了
Somebody blocked the road.

136
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,870
一定不是什么好事
Can't be for anything good.

137
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,680
陛下  留在車里
Your Majesty, stay inside.

138
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,450
如果你們想的話就下來看看
Take a look if you want,

139
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,830
但把槍都端好了
but keep your guns up.

140
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,150
梯隊向右
Echelon right.

141
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
向那棟樓行進
Force towards the building over there.

142
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:25,830
迪恩家電維修

143
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,990
大家圍著國王
Let's close around the king.

144
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,200
我來掩護
I got cover.

145
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,170
我們到那棟樓去
Let's move towards the building.

146
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,730
本杰明  把槍端起來
Benjamin, get your gun up.

147
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,610
端得夠高了嗎
Think that's high enough?

148
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,100
你做得挺好的  伙計
You're fine, man.

149
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:23,930
葬我于此

150
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,070
天啊
Jesus...

151
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,630
這個世界把人逼瘋了
This world drives one mad.

152
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,460
人們經歷了各種苦難
People have lived through every kind of misery...

153
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,920
暴君  種族滅絕  仇恨制度
tyrants, genocide, systems of quiet hate...

154
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,040
而別人卻在同一塊土地上享受著自由
while others enjoy freedom on the same piece of land.

155
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,520
然而如今  我們唯有這樣生存
Yet this, how we must exist now...

156
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,760
沒全都被逼瘋僅僅是走運
It is mere luck we are not all insane.

157
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,980
這不是走運  陛下
It isn't luck, Your Majesty.

158
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,110
怎講
How's that?

159
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,090
這世界確實把人逼瘋了
The world does drive people crazy now.

160
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,030
但是
But...

161
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,770
你為我們創造了新世界
you made us another world.

162
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,880
你們遲到了
You're late.

163
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,910
希望你能原諒  我們在路上...
If you could indulge us your pardon, our path...

164
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,670
我不想聽
I don't want to hear about it.

165
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,500
別打斷國王
Don't interrupt the king.

166
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,800
你個獐頭鼠目的混蛋
You rat-faced prick.

167
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,120
以西結  這里沒有國王
Ezekiel, there aren't any kings,

168
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,330
總統或首相
presidents, or prime ministers.

169
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,290
那些都是童話故事了
And all that is a fairy tale, too.

170
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,880
別在我們面前玩"陛下"那一套
Don't bring that "Your Highness" Shit our way.

171
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,110
很感謝你們一直上貢  但是
Now, I appreciate that you've been delivering, but...

172
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,040
氣氛總是不必要的緊張
things have been unnecessarily tense,

173
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,590
所以我也不必要的緊張
and that makes me unnecessarily tense.

174
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,960
我來辦這事不是找壓力的
I didn't go this route for stress.

175
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,780
不  我是來放松的
No. Just the opposite.

176
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,970
那么進入正題  今天的貢品帶了嗎
So let's get to it. Do you have today's offering?

177
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,380
你們的槍我也要
I want your guns, too.

178
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,590
協議可沒有這條
We did not agree to that.

179
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,700
你們有個選擇
Well, you got a choice...

180
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,110
我猜一開始你們就有這個選擇
Same one that's been there since the beginning, I guess.

181
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,080
你們可以交出槍
You can give up your guns,

182
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,090
或者開槍試試
or you can try to use them.

183
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
選哪個
What's it gonna be?

184
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,080
我們應該交槍  陛下
We should give them over, Your Majesty.

185
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,390
我們應該交槍  陛下
"Ehh, we should give 'em over, Your Majesty".

186
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,790
或許我應該用棍子捅穿你喉嚨
Or maybe I'll just shove this down your throat.

187
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,700
把棍子還給摩根
Give Morgan his stick back.

188
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,540
槍就給你們
Then you can have the guns.

189
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,990
-然后大家各奔東西  -以西結
- And all of us can go on with our day's journeys. - Ezekiel...

190
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,680
我需要你明白現在這種局面的嚴重性
I need you to understand the gravity of what's happening here.

191
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,350
我給了你選擇
I gave you a choice.

192
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,900
你選哪個
What is it going to be?

193
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,800
選吧
Come on.

194
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,410
你知道該選哪個
You know the answer.

195
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,560
算了
It's fine.

196
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,620
槍給他們
Give them your guns.

197
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
我們拿走你們的槍
We took your guns just now

198
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,330
是因為你們馬上會動感情
because things are about to get emotional.

199
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,380
據以往的經驗
You guys have proven

200
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,340
你們一感情用事  就搞砸事情
that you don't do so good with emotional.

201
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,520
貢品不夠
You're short.

202
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,720
我們要十二顆  這只有十一顆
We said 12. I count 11.

203
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,960
是十二顆
There are 12 there.

204
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,680
-不是  -再數一遍
- There aren't. - Count again.

205
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,130
你來數
You count them!

206
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,950
我數過的
I counted them.

207
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,420
我數過  這不可能
I did. T-This is impossible.

208
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
有可能
It's possible.

209
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,030
是真的
It's real.

210
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,780
就發生在眼前
It's happening now.

211
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,770
而現在  問題必須解決
And the problems have to end...now.

212
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,880
你們必須明白代價
You have to learn the stakes here,

213
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,580
我們得教教你們
so we're gonna teach you.

214
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,490
你們不用動手
You don't have to do anything.

215
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,170
一小時之內我們會送來雙倍貢品
We'll get you twice the tribute in an hour.

216
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,830
現在
Right now...

217
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,310
是唯一重要的時間
is the only time that matters.

218
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,430
而現在
And right now...

219
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,260
你們沒有履行義務
you haven't held up your side of the bargain.

220
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,010
在我們談了
After we have talked about things,

221
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,620
一遍又一遍之后
over and over again and again.

222
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,880
我們只能做個了結
So we're gonna deal with all of this...

223
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,930
就現在
right now.

224
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,730
現在  是字面意思的"現在"嗎
Right now as in..."right now"?

225
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,970
是的
Yeah.

226
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,120
現在
Right...now.

227
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,280
動手吧
Just do it.

228
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,260
好吧
Okay.

229
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,920
不
No!

230
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,550
不

大家都別動
Everybody settle down!

232
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,590
我們得把本杰明帶回神之國
We need to get Benjamin back to the Kingdom.

233
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,210
把那人的棍子還他
Give the man his damn stick!

234
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,510
滾回車里去  一個字都別說
Get in the truck! Don't say a goddamn word!

235
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,330
-我們得回去  -不行
- We need to get back. ?- No.

236
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,330
現在  你們都得聽好了
Right now, you have to listen.

237
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,610
就這一次  給我聽仔細了
For once, be present and listen.

238
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,830
以后  你們必須每一次
You will make your deliveries on time,

239
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,110
都按時送貨  不能少一分
every time, and they will be complete.

240
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,820
要么優秀要么不及格  沒有未完成
It's A's or F's, no I's.

241
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,020
明天把你們欠的貢品送過來
You are gonna show me that you understand

242
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,270
向我證明你們懂我的意思了
by bringing the balance of what you owe tomorrow.

243
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,180
我們得馬上走  他會流血身亡的
We need to go! He's bleeding out!

244
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,920
一顆甜瓜  不多不少
One cantaloupe, not more, not less!

245
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,180
明白了嗎
Do you understand?!

246
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,530
明白了
Yes, I understand.

247
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,550
-去處理他的傷口吧  -好
- Go patch him up. - Okay.

248
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,290
戴安  我們得帶他去卡蘿爾那里
Dianne, we need to drive to Carol's!

249

We loaded her up with medical supplies!

250

得趕快止住他的血
We need to stop the bleeding.

251
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,560
他撐不到回神之國了
He's not gonna make it to the Kingdom.

252
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,700
走吧
Let's go!

253
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,110
上來

我就在這  堅持住
I'm right here. Stay with me.

沒事的
It's okay.

259
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,590
"傷害敵人
"T-To injure an opponent...

260
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,590

is to injure yourself.

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,250
很抱歉過來打攪你
I'm sorry for coming to you.

262
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,250
我們實在沒辦法了
We had no choice.

263
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,550
摩根  等等
Morgan, wait.

264
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,260
好了
Okay.

265
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,020

葬我于此

267
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,480
清醒

268
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,870
別靠近我
Stay away from me.

269
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,690
聽著就好

270
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,950
聽著就好
Just listen.

271
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,400
葬我于此

272
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,820
聽著就好

273
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,990
不  不
No! No! Aah!

274
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,700
我知道
I know!

275
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,570
不  不  不
No! No! No!

276
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,930
我知道
I know!

277
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,750
夠了  不
Enough! No!

278
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,070
本杰明  把槍端起來
Benjamin, get your gun up.

279
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,980
本來死的人該是我
It was supposed to be me.

280
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,660
加文說過
That's what Gavin said --

281
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,840
我會是第一個
that I'd be first.

282
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,820
我本想阻止的
I was trying to stop it.

283
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,410
我本想獻出自己的性命來警醒你們
I was gonna give my life to show you!

284
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,550
今天本該那樣的
That's what should've happened today.

285
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,250
我是那樣試著做的
That's what I tried.

286
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,320
但是發生了意料之外的事
And something else happened

287
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,420
因為我們沒有做什么去阻止他們
because we have done nothing to stop them.

288
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,990
我們什么都沒做
We've done nothing!

289
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,910
沒做
Nothing.

290
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
災變發生時我在一個營地
I was in a camp when it started.

291
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,300
無邊無際的大營
It was huge...endless...

292
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,640
到處是帳篷  茅廁
a city of -- of tarps and latrines

293
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,840
炊煙  嬰兒的哭聲
and wood smoke and babies crying.

294
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,900
總有嬰兒的哭聲
There were always babies crying.

295
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,170
我知道情況不妙
I knew they had problems,

296
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,380
但我不覺得輪得到我來管
but I didn't think they were mine to solve.

297
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,770
我以為比我有能力比我聰明的人會管
I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.

298
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,220
我算什么呢
W-Who the hell am I, right?

299
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,430
所以我什么都沒做
So I did nothing.

300
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,060
之后有一場戰斗
A-And there was a fight...

301
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,890
起了火
and a fire.

302
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,140
我失去了妻子
And I lost my wife.

303
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,910
三天沒有食物  沒有睡覺
And after three days of running,

304
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,030
恐怖駭人的
no food, and no sleep...

305
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,050
逃命后
of horror and terror...

306
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,250
我失去了女兒
I lost my little girl.

307
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,250
就在我面前...
Right in front of me...

308
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,380
因為我什么都沒做
because I didn't do something.

309
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,090
因為我干等
Because I waited.

310
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,080
聽我說
Listen to me.

311
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,220
拜托
Please.

312
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,130
聽著就好
Just listen.

313
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,410
我們可以利用這事
We can use what's happened.

314
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,430
我們可以向救世軍表明我們吸取了教訓
We can show the Saviors that we get it.

315
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,080
我們明白要做什么
We understand what we need to do.

316
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,720
我們知道怎么繼續下去
We know how to go on.

317
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,320
他們要相信我們
And they need to believe us.

318
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,290
我們必須得做點什么使他們相信
We have to do something to make them believe us.

319
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,640
等我們贏回他們的信任后
And then, when we gain their trust back...

320
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,730
再殺了他們
we kill them...

321
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,750
一了百了
end them.

322
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,740
我們加入亞歷山大和山頂寨的同盟
We join with Alexandria and the Hilltop,

323
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,380
一舉殲滅他們
and we crush them in one fell swoop.

324
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
但你得接受事實  摩根
But this is it, Morgan.

325
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,140
你必須要殺戮
You have...to...kill.

326
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,540
不然你還不如自殺
Or else you might as well just kill yourself.

327
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,990
總得有人死
Someone had to die.

328
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,660
我曾想成為那個人  但沒有成功
I tried to be the one. That didn't happen.

329
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,660
所以我要成為領導我們的軍隊
So I'll be the one to lead our army

330
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,940
去粉碎救世軍的人  摧毀他們
to crush the Saviors -- destroy them.

331
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,870
我
Me.

332
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,170
我會和以西結說
I'll talk to Ezekiel.

333
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,750
我會告訴所有人我做的事
I'll tell everyone what I did.

334
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,560
然后我會用余生去彌補
And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.

335
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,480
你告訴他了嗎
Did you tell him?

336
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,510
有嗎
Did you?

337
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,380
現在不行
Not now.

338
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,160
我們回去再說
We'll talk about it when we get back.

339
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,200
什么事
What is it?

340
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,140
最好我們回去再說  陛下
It's better to talk about it when we get back, Your Majesty.

341
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,410
現在就說
We'll talk about it now.

342
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,520
那孩子怎么樣
How's the kid?

343
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,850
他死了
He's dead.

344
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,440
在我殺了你之前快滾
Start walking back now before I kill you.

345
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,300
你多說一句  多瞟一眼
You say one word or throw one look,

346
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,780
我就地殺了你
I'll kill you right here and now.

347
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,650
滾
Go!

348
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,090
東西拿了嗎
Do you have it?

349
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,320
我只想說  我們明白了
I just want to say we get it.

350
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,930
我們懂了
We understand.

351
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,010
-住手  -別管
- Cease this! - Leave 'em be!

352
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,530
摩根  住手
Morgan! Stop!

353
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,700
摩根
Morgan!

354
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,390
都是他搞的鬼
He set it all up.

355
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,880
他昨天擋路  讓我們遲到
He blocked the road yesterday, made us late.

356
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,280
都是他干的
It was all him.

357
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,680
我們離開時  貢品還在
And we had your offering when we left --

358
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,750
全都在
had it all.

359
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,770
他從里面拿走了一顆  藏了起來
He took one from the cargo, and he hid it --

360
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,160
在我們停車時
when we stopped.

361
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,490
他想挑起神之國和救世軍的爭端
He wanted to get something started between the Kingdom and the Saviors.

362
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,900
我想讓你看到...
Wanted to show you...

363
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,410
我想讓你看到我們吸取了教訓
Wanted to show you that we get it...

364
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,720
我們明白要做什么
That we understand what it is that we need to do --

365
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,460
我們知道怎么繼續下去
that we know how to go on.

366
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,940
很好
Good.

367
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,790
下周  同一時間
Next week, same time.

368
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,500
我們明白
We -- We understand.

369
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,780
是他干的
He -- He did this?

370
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,470
他之前就想為我們死
He wanted to die for us before.

371
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,130
他希望死的是自己
He wanted it to be him.

372
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,440
他以為自己有的選  所以德韋恩才死了
Thought he could choose, and that's why Duane had to die.

373
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,660
"德韋恩"
"Duane"?

374
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,600
本杰明  所以本杰明才...
Benjamin -- Benjamin -- That's why Benjamin...

375
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,730
摩根
Morgan...

376
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,170
我們走吧
let us take our leave.

377
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,060
我本來就打算走
I was supposed to.

378
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,030
摩根  你不能一個人待在外面
Morgan, you should not be alone here.

379
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,090
走吧
Go.

380
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,060
現在不行
Not now.

381
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,420
-本杰明不想...  -我說了現在不行
- Benjamin not -- would not - ?Man, I said not now!

我說了...
I said...

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,790
你們走吧

掐死了他
I strangled him.

389
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,570
他害死了本杰明  所以...
He's the one got Benjamin killed, so...

390
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,430
你想知道亞歷山大發生了什么嗎
Do you want to know what happened in Alexandria?

391

他們還殺了更多人

殺了斯賓塞  奧利維亞

399
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,430
耶穌帶瑞克一伙人來是因為

400
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,160
瑞克想反抗他們
