《行尸走肉》前情提要
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,610
不敢相信他會帶我們的東西跑掉
I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,980
他顯然不想被找到
He obviously doesn't wanna be found.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,200
他想的
Yes, he does.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,860
我們來此請求你與我們一同反抗救世軍
We came to ask you to join us in fighting the Saviors.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,320
會死很多人  不僅是救世軍
People will die, and not just the Saviors.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,240
我可以為友人達里爾提供庇護
I offer our friend Daryl asylum.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,670
他在這里很安全
He will be safe here.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,220
是時候反抗了
It's time to fight.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,130
不
No...

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,550
我不想參與這事
this is something I am not a part of.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,650
加文  讓你的人住手
Gavin, tell your man to stop.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,500
黛安
Diane.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,960
好的
Got it.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,280
好箭法
Good shot.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,350
我妹妹有過一條那樣的裙子
My sister had that dress.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,530
別想了
Don't think about it.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,530
很好
Nice.

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,890
越來越有條不紊了
It's getting to be like clockwork.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,560
現在嗎  頭兒
Now, boss?

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,620
是的  杰瑞
Yes, Jerry.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,270
看上去少了
It looks light.

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,330
也許你該再看看  加文
Perhaps you might look again, Gavin.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,090
我們履行了義務
We've met our obligations.

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,670
沒錯
You're right.

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,830
看上去不怎么多  但  八  九  十
Doesn't seem like much, but 8, 9, 10.

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,180
你說得對
You're right.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,990
我想要他的槍
I want his gun.

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,450
實際上  我覺得就不該給這混蛋配槍
In fact, I don't think this asshole should have a gun ever.

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
壞小子不許碰槍
No guns for bad boys.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,400
是你先打的我  混球
You hit me first, prick.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,490
你說什么
What's that?

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,150
好了
Okay.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,790
這下該如何是好
Where do we go from here?

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,990
是啊  陛下
That's right, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,420
這下該如何是好
Where do we go from here?

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,510
把武器給他  理查德
Hand him your weapon, Richard.

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,300
放下槍  白癡
Stand down, idiot.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
去死吧  你個孫子
Suck on it, you little shit.

40
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,840
理查德
Richard! ?

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,560
住手
Stand down!

42
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,280
以西結  你知道我不能容忍這種事
Ezekiel, you know I can't have this.

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,880
是我們不能容忍這種事
We can't have this.

44
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,920
理查德將被禁止參與我們未來的會面
Richard will refrain from attending our future exchanges.

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,430
不不  以西結  你得一直把他帶上
No. No, Ezekiel, you're gonna keep bringing him.

46
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,280
因為假如這種事繼續發生
'Cause if this doesn't stop,

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,210
假如這發展成了一個真正的問題
if this starts becoming a real problem,

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,860
你還記得我說過什么吧
you remember what I said.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,510
他會是第一個被球棒砸的
He is still batting first on the lineup.

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,450
我自己剛剛差點都動手了
Almost did it myself just now.

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,200
我知道這不是他的錯  但...
I know it's not his fault, but...

52
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,190
不能再發生這種事了
this has got to stop.

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,970
所以...
So...

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,280
也許以后得...
things might need to get a little...

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,870
野蠻點
visceral.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,030
杰瑞德  快他媽起來
Jared, get the hell up!

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,230
我們走吧
Let's get the hell out of here.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,220
我能不能...
Can I, um...

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,700
我能不能要回我的棍子  麻煩了
Can I have my stick back, please?

60
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,130
這是別人給我的
Someone gave it to me.

61
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,350
這人已經去世了
Someone who's gone.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
加文  你得讓我把這個傻逼揍一頓
Gavin, you got to let me turn up this dipshit.

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,880
不  不行
No! No!

64
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,240
你...
Just...

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,480

104
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,010
你們坐卡車去哪了
Where'd you go in them trucks?

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,820
我得跟達里爾單獨談談  好嗎
I need to speak to Daryl alone. That okay?

106
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,430
我幫你找點東西包扎傷口
Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.

107
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,180
好
Yeah.

108
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,100
你們去見救世軍了  對吧
You went to see them, right?

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,360
對
Yeah.

110
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,930
協議的一部分嗎
Part of your deal?

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,670
你沒毛病吧
What the hell's wrong with you?

112
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
你流血了
You're bleeding.

113
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,780
他們打的
They did that to you.

114
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,110
-你知道他們是什么東西  -我知道
- You know what they are. - I do.

115
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,830
知道嗎  如果卡蘿爾在這
You know, if Carol were here,

116
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,690
如果她看到了
she saw all that...

117
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,180
如果她知道了亞伯拉罕
if she knew about Abraham...

118
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,490
和格倫的事
and Glenn...

119
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,530
她會帶我們去找他們
she'd be leading us right to them,

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,700
干掉他們所有人
ready to kill them all.

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,450
沒錯
She would.

122
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,720
這也是她離開的原因
And that's why she left, man.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
我在練習
I'm practicing.

124
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,050
得多用弓箭了
Gonna have to start using these more.

125
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,660
救世軍深知不該讓我帶槍在他們附近晃悠
The Saviors are smart enough to know I shouldn't have a gun around them.

126
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,300
摩根說你是弩手
Morgan said you're a bowman.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,980
為什么
Why?

128
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,140
因為我們的目標一致
'Cause we want the same things.

129
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,170
我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

130
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,740
行尸走肉
『第七季  第十集』

131
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,110
我們需要一些事來打動以西結
We need something to move Ezekiel.

132
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,450
此區域禁止野營

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,700
現在就是機會
This is it.

134
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,060
亞歷山大  山頂寨和神之國先下手為強
Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom hitting first,

135
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,550
重創他們  然后從世上抹殺救世軍
hitting hard, and then we wipe the Saviors from the Earth.

136
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,820
保護人們
Keeping people...

137
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,050
很多很多好人
dozens and dozens and dozens of good people...

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,210
保護他們
keeping them safe.

139
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,050
公墓

140
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,330
他們從這條路走
They ride this road.

141
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,590
有車路過  肯定是救世軍
If we see cars, it's the Saviors.

142
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,980
最近他們三五人一伙常來
They've been coming in packs of two or three lately.

143
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
所以我需要你
That's why I need you.

144
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,240
我一個人對付不了
I can't take them alone.

145
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,680
先用槍攻擊他們
We're gonna hit them with the guns first...

146
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,060
然后用燃燒瓶
and then the Molotovs.

147
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,760
然后再用槍  直到他們全滅
Then back to the guns until they're dead.

148
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,070
-為什么用火  -要看起來慘烈點
- Why the fire? - Needs to look bad.

149
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,330
發現尸骸的救世軍
The Saviors who discover what's left...

150
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,580
我們要讓他們震怒
we want them to be angry.

151
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,510
我留了蹤跡到我做的偽武器庫
I left a trail from here to the weapons cache I planted,

152
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,420
到以西結在乎的某人住的小屋
to the cabin of that someone Ezekiel cares about.

153
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,120
誰啊
Who's that?

154
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,210
不過是他遇見的某個獨行者
It's just some loner he met.

155
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,150
有時候他會送食物過去
Sometimes he brings food.

156
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,170
他們為什么不住在神之國
Why don't they live in the Kingdom?

157
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,170
我不知道
I don't know.

158
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,330
她住在外面  會死在外面的
She lives out there, she'll die out there.

159
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,170
是個女人嗎
It's a woman?

160
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,910
這有什么關系  她比我們膽子還大
What does that matter? She's got more balls than you and me.

161
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,470
反正她都要死的
She's gonna die either way.

162
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,740
救世軍來了發現他們的人死了以后
When the Saviors come and find their buddies dead,

163
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,700
如果他們不蠢
if they know their elbow from their asshole

164
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
會追蹤明顯的蹤跡
and can follow an obvious spoor,

165
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,580
他們就會找到武器庫  然后是小屋
they're gonna go to the weapons cache and then to the cabin,

166
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,780
他們會攻擊這個女人
and they're gonna attack this woman.

167
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
她叫什么
What's her name?

168
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,210
也許他們會殺了她  也許殺不了
Maybe they kill her, maybe they don't,

169
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,400
但這會讓以西結知道該做什么
but it's gonna show Ezekiel what he needs to do.

170
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,790
她名字  叫什么
Her name. What is it?

171
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,920
她很強  也許她能活下來
She's tough. Maybe she'll live.

172
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,410
他媽的說名字
Say her damn name!

173
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,230
卡蘿爾
Carol.

174
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,100
我真希望你不認識她
I hoped you didn't know her,

175
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,920
但我不知道你會在意
but I didn't think you'd care,

176
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,660
因為你知道必須做什么
'cause you know what needs to happen.

177
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,650
-不行  -也許她能活的
- No. - ?Maybe she'll live.

178
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,490
聽著  這就是我們的機會
Look, this -- this is how -- this is how this could happen.

179
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,320
這就是除掉救世軍的方法
This is how we can get rid of the Saviors,

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,250
這樣我們都有未來
how we all can have a future.

181
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,390
她獨自住在野外
She's living out there on her own,

182
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,180
-只是在等死  -不行
- just waiting to die. - ?No!

183
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,840
如果我們不做什么  會死更多的人
If we don't do anything, a hell of a lot more people are gonna die,

184
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,980
想活的人
people who want to live!

185
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,950
你給我離卡蘿爾遠點  聽見了嗎
You stay the hell away from Carol, you hear me?

186
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,730
他們來了
It's them.

187
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,610
我們可以等著事情變糟
Look, we can wait for things to go bad,

188
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,230
失去人們
we lose people...

189
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,670
或者我們可以咬牙做難事
or we can do the hard thing...

190
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
選擇自己的命運
and choose our fate for ourselves.

191
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,640
不行
No.

192
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,280
對不起
Sorry.

193
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,340
會有更多人的
There'll be more.

194
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,810
或者那些人
Or those --

195
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,440
過會兒會再從這條路回去
they're gonna ride back this way later.

196
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,560
我們還有機會
We'll have another chance.

197
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,060
但時間不多了
But we're running out of time.

198
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,020
如果你和你的人想反抗救世軍
If you and your people want to move against the Saviors...

199
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,570
就得盡快下手  你們需要神之國
you need to do it soon, and you need the Kingdom.

200
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,900
我們要做的事總會有犧牲的
What we have to do requires sacrifice one way or another.

201
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,890
我們這樣的人
Guys like us...

202
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,680
已經失去了太多
we've already lost so much.

203
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,650
你不了解我
You don't know me.

204
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,150
我知道...
I know...

205
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,470
卡蘿爾  孤身在外生活...
that Carol, living on her own like that...

206
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,370
她現在可能已經死了
she might as well be dead right now.

207
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,080
如果她受傷  她死了
She gets hurt, she dies,

208
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,140
她染上風寒
if she catches a fever,

209
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,440
她被行尸殺了...
if she's taken out by a walker...

210
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,250
她被閃電劈中...
if she gets hit by lightning --

211
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,590
只要她出了一點點事  我就殺了你
anything -- anything happens to her, I'll kill you.

212
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,170
我愿意為神之國而死
I would die for the Kingdom.

213
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,980
那你怎么不去死
Why don't you?

214
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,050
你們有沒有領頭的人
Are you a collective, or does one lead?

215
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
這位
This.

216
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,940
我叫瑞克
I'm Rick.

217
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,320
你們的命在我們手里
We own your lives.

218
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,420
想換回去嗎
You want buy them back?

219
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,890
你們有什么好東西嗎
Have anything?

220
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,280
你們抓了一個我們的人
Well, you have one of my people.

221
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,930
加百利
Gabriel.

222
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,260
我想先見見他  然后再談
I want to see him first. Then we can talk.

223
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,710
你們拿走的船上的東西被別人奪走了
The boat things you took got taken.

224
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,810
我們看到了  就拿走了剩下的東西
Saw them, so we took the rest.

225
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,890
順便把他也帶了回來
And we took him.

226
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,890
那你就知道我們沒有可以用來
Well, then you know we have nothing

227
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,800
交換我們性命的東西
to buy back our lives with.

228
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,130
你們也即將一無所有
That's what you'll have soon -- nothing.

229
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,490
因為我和我的人聽命于
Because me and my people already belong to that group

230
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,610
那伙奪走船上物資的人
who took those supplies from the boat.

231
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,250
他們叫救世軍
They're called the Saviors.

232
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,280
我們的命在他們手里
They own our lives.

233
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,400
如果你們殺了我們
And if you kill us,

234
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,050
就等于奪走了他們的東西
you'll be taking something from them.

235
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,720
他們會來找你們
And they will come looking.

236
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,690
遇上救世軍  你只有兩個選擇
You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors --

237
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,780
被殺或者被他們所支配
either they kill you or they own you.

238
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,780
不過有一個出路
But there is a way out.

239
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,480
加入我們
Join us.

240
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,720
加入我們  反抗他們
Join us in fighting them.

241
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,330
不
No.

242
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,100
羅西塔  不要
Rosita, don't!

243
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,780
所有人都住手
Everybody, stop!

244
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,720
等等
Just wait!

245
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,560
放了我們  否則我殺了她
Let us go, or I will kill her!

246
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,310
立刻放了塔米爾
Away from Tamiel now.

247
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,860
救世軍  他們...
The Saviors, they --

248
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,080
他們還有其他地方  其他社區
they have other places, other communities.

249
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,390
他們有各種東西
They have things --

250
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,140
食物  武器  車  燃料
food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.

251
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,060
你們想要什么  救世軍都有
Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.

252
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,040
放了塔米爾
Away from Tamiel.

253
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,020
你說吧
Your words now.

254
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,480
如果加入我們  一起打倒他們
If you join us and we beat them together,

255
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,390
你們可以獲得很多他們的東西
you can have much of what's theirs.

256
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,510
與我們一起戰斗  你們少不了好處
Fighting with us, you'll be rewarded,

257
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,320
多到超乎你們的想象
more than you can imagine.

258
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,480
我現在就要
Want something now.

259
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,900
瑞克
Rick...

260
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,240
他無所不能
can do anything.

261
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,460
這群人
This group?

262
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,690
他們來這里找到了我  離家那么遠
They found me -- here, so far from our home.

263
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,810
你想要什么
What do you need?

264
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,210
告訴我們  我們會幫你弄來的
Just tell us -- we'll get it for you.

265
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,820
我們會向你們展現出我們的實力
We'll show you what we can do.

266
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,780
就現在
Now.

267
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,540
塔米爾  布里昂
Tamiel, Brion...

268
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,840
把瑞克帶到"坡頂"
show Rick Up Up Up.

269
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,790
沒事的
It's okay.

270
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,380
這邊
Here.

271
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,360
坐吧
Sit.

272
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
謝謝  我沒事
Thanks. I'm okay.

273
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,710
這些人是誰
Who are these people?

274
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,830
我猜  是你新交的好朋友吧
New best friends, I guess?

275
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,940
他們要帶瑞克去哪
Where are they taking him?

276
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,460
我們所有人  自災變之后
All of us, here since the change.

277
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,940
只拿  不費心
We take. We don't bother.

278
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,780
但情況變得越來越難
Things grow harder.

279
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,090
有時候我們打開罐頭  發現里面已經腐壞了
We open cans, sometimes inside's rotten.

280
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,880
日子一天天過去
Time's passed.

281
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,990
情況又再次變了
Things are changing again.

282
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,940
或許我們也該變了
So maybe we change.

283
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,210
或許吧
Maybe.

284
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,430
我需要知道你是不是認真的
Need to know you're real with this,

285
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,850
看你是否值得
that you're worth it.

286
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,550
你干了什么
What did you do?!

287
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,330
瑞克
Rick!

288
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,520
我沒事
I'm all right.

289
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,910
瑞克
Rick!

290
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,000

The walls!

291
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,510
利用
Use them!

292
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,770
你現在相信我們了嗎
You believe us now?!

293
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,110
告訴我們你想要什么
Just tell us what you want...

294
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,220
我們幫你弄來
and we'll get it.

295
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,790
槍
Guns.

296
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,910
很多
A lot.

297
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,270
很多槍
A lot.

298
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,880
拿到后我們會加入你的戰斗
And then we fight your fight.

299
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,900
你確定我們會贏嗎
You know we will win?

300
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,870
我當然確定
Oh, I know it.

301
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,090
結束后  我們要分一半的戰利品
After, we get half of what's won.

302
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,560
給你們三分之一
Oh, you'll get a third.

303
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,420
并且把之前從我們這偷的東西還回來
And we're taking back what you just stole from us.

304
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,580
一半
Half.

305
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,720
三分之一
A third.

306
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,100
一半
Half.

307
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,960
三分之一
A third.

308
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,970
三分之一  但不歸還我們偷的東西
A third, and we keep what we stole.

309
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,240
我們拿走的罐頭  還你們一半
Half of the jars, the ones we took.

310
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,390
這次不還價
One time, this time.

311
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,380
同意嗎
Yes?

312
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,770
說同意
Say yes.

313
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,060
同意
Yes.

314
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,620
還有槍
And the guns.

315
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,430
還有槍
And the guns.

316
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,300
我們在那艘船邊上等了很久
Waited by the boat long time.

317
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,540
想要點補償
Want something for it.

318
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,330
所以就這樣
So it's this.

319
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,150
罐頭和槍  槍和罐頭
Jars and guns, guns and jars.

320
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,990
你們就等著別人替你們從船上拿出物資嗎
You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you?

321
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,880
等很久了
Long time.

322
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,160
我們只拿  不費心
We take. We don't bother.

323
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,130
里面那個...
You had that...

324
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,470
那個東西就是為了讓別人證明自己的嗎
thing down there for someone to prove themselves?

325
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,010
不是
No.

326
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,830
他叫溫斯洛
His name was Winslow.

327
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,230
你想對加百利做什么
What were you gonna do with Gabriel?

328
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,730
走吧
Go.

329
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,440
協議是有期限的
Deal expires.

330
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,320
很快過期
Soon.

331
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,650
你叫什么
What's your name?

332
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,080
簡迪斯
Jadis.

333
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,070
達成協議了
We have a deal.

334
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,870
我和理查德說了不要再來看我
I told Richard no more visits.

335
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,290
我知道
I am aware.

336
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,480
你渴望獨處
Your desire is solitude.

337
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,640
我就是這樣下令的
That's what I've ordered to be facilitated.

338
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,830
我的人是來清理行尸的
My men are here clearing the wasted.

339
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,100
行尸向來都不顧他人是否想獨處
The dead are quite inconsiderate when it comes to those who are wanting to be alone.

340
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,250
我以為我們輕手輕腳
I thought our efforts would be quiet enough

341
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,940
不會引起你的注意
to fall beneath your notice.

342
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,000
是你打開了門
You're the one who opened the door.

343
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,710
我的警戒線被碰到了
Tripped my wire.

344
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,890
我以為我及時抓住它了呢
Thought I caught it in time.

345
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,550
抱歉
Sorry.

346
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,870
您把它們藏得很好  女士
You hid them well, lady.

347
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,060
不要叫她女士
Don't call her "Lady."

348
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,960
夫人  小姐  太太
Ma'am, Ms., missus...

349
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,770
你可以閉嘴了
You can shut up now.

350
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,790
收到
Copy.

351
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,780
再見  陛下
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

352
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,530
等等
Hold up.

353
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,510
水果餡餅
Cobbler.

354
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,300
凱文說你喜歡吃
Kevin said you like it.

355
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,180
這是以備你開門的
Just in case you did open the door.

356
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,650
走吧
Go.

357
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,370
好了
Okay.

358
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,910
耶穌帶我們來了神之國
Jesus took us to the Kingdom.

359
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,100
摩根說你離開了
Morgan said you just left.

360
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,990
我在外面的時候
I was out here.

361
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,240
看到了你
I saw you.

362
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,960
你為什么要走
Why'd you go?

363
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,900
我必須走
I had to.

364
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,070
我站崗的時候聽到了動靜
I heard something when I was on watch,

365
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,850
是從晲蔬捷ヮ茠
from inside the wall.

366
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,620
我去儲藏室查看  有個人偷襲了我
I went into the pantry, one of them jumped me.

367
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,540
她很生氣  因為他們等了那么久
She was angry because she didn't get the supplies from the boat

368
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,820
最后也沒得到船上的物資
after all the waiting.

369
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,410
所以他們逼我把余下東西裝好
So they made me pack up everything else.

370
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,480
但是她說他們在船附近  所以我希望...
But she said they were at the boat, so I hoped...

371
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,260
不  你不只是希望
No. You didn't just hope.

372
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,650
你把我們引到了這里
You got us here.

373
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,910
我已經開始要失去信心了
I was beginning to lose faith.

374
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,010
但是我看到了你
But then I saw you.

375
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,870
然后你向我點頭
And you nodded at me.

376
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,810
你知道我沒有離開
I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave,

377
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
你搜尋后找到我
that you searched and found me,

378
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,830
你看到這么多人
that you, seeing these numbers,

379
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,040
你看起來很...
you seemed so...

380
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,480
高興
glad.

381
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,460
我們會糾正這一切的
We will set things right.

382
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,530
但是在這以前境況會非常困難
But things are gonna get very hard before that time.

383
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,660
我們必須堅持
We have to hold on.

384
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,020
我會的
I will.

385
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,610
謝謝你
Thank you.

386
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,410
你為什么笑
What made you smile?

387
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,730
什么讓你這么自信
What made you so... confident?

388
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,520
有人向我展示了敵人也可以變為朋友
Someone showed me enemies can become friends.

389
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,990
我們不應該回亞歷山大
We shouldn't be going back to Alexandria.

390
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,530
我們得留在外面
We need to stay out

391
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,880
為協議找槍
and look for the guns for this deal.

392
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,010
瑞克受傷了  亞倫受傷了
Rick is hurt. Aaron is hurt.

393
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,450
我更擔心埃里克看到我的臉
I'm more nervous about what Eric will say

394
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,270
又成這樣會怎么說
if he sees my face like this again.

395
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,670
家里的人需要食物
People back home need food.

396
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,700
瑞克想帶回補給  然后重整旗鼓
Rick wants to bring supplies back and we regroup,

397
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,340
所以要這樣做
so that's what we're doing.

398
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,010
那我自己去
Then I'll go on my own.

399
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,010
我們要待在一起  就這樣
We are sticking together, and that's it.

400
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,980
你怎么了
What is your problem?

401
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,660
我們現在不是要挑起爭端  羅西塔
We're not looking for a fight right now, Rosita!

402
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,370
我們在為戰斗做準備
We're getting ready for one.

403
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,080
戰斗時刻都有  塔拉
It's always a fight, Tara.

404
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,070
我不會讓任何人擋我們的路或拖后腿
I'm not letting anyone get in our way or slow us down.

405
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,260
阻止別人掠奪我們也好
If we got to stop people from taking from us

406
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,880
從別人那里搶也好
or we got to take from other people,

407
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,790
我不在乎
I don't care.

408
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,110
我們要贏
We win.

409
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,350
成熟點吧
Grow up.

410
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,650
槍
Guns.

411
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,050
快點
Soon.

412
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,540
快點  要么免談
Soon. Or else.

413
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,960
我們幫你縫好針后
Once we get you stitched up,

414
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,220
我們馬上回去找槍  好嗎
we'll go right back out and find the guns, right?

415
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,390
好的
That's right.

416
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,370
你知道去哪找嗎
Do you have any idea where?

417
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,930
不知道  但是這從沒阻止過我們
No, but that's never stopped us before.

418
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,780
塔拉  你在外面比我們走得都遠
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

419
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,240
至少你能告訴我們別去哪找
At least you can tell us where not to look.

420
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,100
好的
Yeah.

我們走吧
Let's go already.

423
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,740
等等
Hold -- Hold on.

424
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,740
為什么你...
Why are you...? ?

425
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,940
因為我們贏了
Because we won.

426
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,060
代替你失去的那個
And to replace the one you lost.

427
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,030
好了
All right?

428
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,600
我們走
Let's go.

429
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,480
我不能失去任何人

不能失去任何一個

我會殺
I would.

435
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,290
如果他們傷害我們的人
If they hurt any of our people --

436
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,610
傷害更多的人  我就會這樣做
any more of them -- that's what I would do.

437
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,820
那之后我將不再是以前的我
And there wouldn't be anything left of me after that.

438
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,200
救世軍  他們來了嗎
The Saviors -- did they come?

439
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,950
是的
Yeah.

440

有人受傷嗎

達里爾

他們來了
They came.

446
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,960
我們殺光了他們
We got them all.

447
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,860
跟剩下的敵人達成了協議  就像以西結一樣
Made a deal with the rest of them, like Ezekiel.

448
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,110
大家都沒事
Everyone's all right.

大家都沒事
Everyone's all right.

450
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,710
還吃不吃飯了  我得是個國王
We gonna eat or -- or I got to be a king or something

451
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,040
才能在這吃飯嗎
to get food around here?

452
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,850
閉嘴
Shut up.

453
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,470
以西結
Ezekiel...

454
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,030
他人好嗎
is he okay?

455
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,480
我覺得挺好的
Yeah, I think he is.

456
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,610
自己保重  好嗎
Watch out for yourself, all right?

457
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,210
它對你很溫馴
Well, you're good with her.

458
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,500
以西結會印象深刻的
Ezekiel will be impressed.

459
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,370
我想養老虎當寵物的人
Well, figure any guy that has a pet tiger

460
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,660
不會壞到哪去
can't be that bad.

461
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,090
卡蘿爾覺得他挺好
He's okay by Carol.

462
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,370
我找到她了  在外面那座小屋子里
Yeah, I found her, out in that little house.

463
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,510
我當時說的話
Look, what I said...

464
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,920
我說她
when I said she just...

465
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,820
離開了
went away...

466
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,890
是她讓我說的
it's what she told me to do.

467
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,240
我懂
No, I get it.

468
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,350
我們需要神之國
We need the Kingdom.

469
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,770
你要促成合作
You got to make that happen.

470
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,090
抱歉
I'm sorry.

471
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,570
我真的很抱歉  但是
I mean, I -- I really am, but, uh...

472
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,420
不能是我
it can't be me.

473
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,070
聽著  你所堅持的東西
Look, whatever it is you're holding on to...

474
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,210
早就沒了
it's already gone, man.

475
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,950
醒醒吧
Wake the hell up.

476
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,280
你和我一樣  達里爾
You're the same as me, Daryl.

477
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,800
你對我毫不了解
You don't know shit about me.

478
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,840
不  我了解
No, I do.

479
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,910
因為你沒告訴卡蘿爾發生了什么
'Cause you didn't tell Carol what happened.

480
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,970
你沒有  不然她會來這里的
You didn't, 'cause she'd be here otherwise.

481
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,640
我對此很高興
And I'm glad for that.

482
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,280
我們都在堅持著一些東西
See, we're all holding on to something.

483
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,650
我早上回山頂寨
I'm going back to Hilltop in the morning

484
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,120
去做準備
