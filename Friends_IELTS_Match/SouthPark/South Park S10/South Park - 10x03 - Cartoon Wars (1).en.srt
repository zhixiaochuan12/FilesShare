3
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,300
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid.

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,100
He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Good night my little angel.

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,600
- Stan !
- What ?! What ?!

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Get up ! Get your shoes on ! Gotta get out of here ! MOOVE !

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,500
Take this, we've goota bring all the water we can !

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Shelly go get my gun !

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
What's going on, dad ?

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,202
Just get the gun !!!

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,203
All right, come on !

13
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:15,700
Kyle, what the hell is going on this time ?

14
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,000
I have no idea.

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,400
Take cover in the community center again.

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,100
All right, everyone get in, and get a seal on that door !

17
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,200
Oh my God, Steven, we've let Butters !

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
We can't go back out there Linda, it's too late for him.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,600
Dad ? Dad what the hell is going on ?

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,200
A cartoon ! A cartoon is about to air on American television with...

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
with the Muslim prophet Muhammed as a character.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
So ?

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,900
So ? Stanley, Muhammad is sacred to the Muslim people.

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Nobody shows an image of Muhammad anymore.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
Which cartoon is it ?

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,800
What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Muhammad as a character ?

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,200
Who do you think ?

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,900
The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor !

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
<i>Family Guy</i> !

31
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,900
How could <i>Family Guy</i> do that ?

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,900
Why would <i>Family Guy</i> so blatantly insult Muslims ?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because <i>Family Guy</i> doesn't care who they insult.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They only care about their precious money !

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,300
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon ?

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,100
We've got the TV working.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Muhammad

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,300
is set to air tonight on <i>Family Guy</i>.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Oh Randy hold me !

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,800
The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,700
All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
and <i>Family Guy</i> posters.

43
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement :

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
So what happens now ?

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
We stay here through the night,

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,500
wait it out to see if they do anything.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,700
If we're still alive in the morning,

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
then we'll know we're not dead !

49
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,600
It's okay !

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,300
We're alive ? We're alive !

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Everyone, everyone listen !

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Fox network censored the image
of Muhammad at the last minute !

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
Oh thank God !

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Well it looks like we dodged a bullet.

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,800
They censored the image
of Muhammad ? How ?

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I tivo every episode, we can go
to my house and see what they did.

57
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,600
Okay you guys, check it out !

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,700
You tivo every episode of <i>Family Guy</i> ?

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
Dude, it's a good show !

60
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Yeah, lots of people like <i>Family Guy</i>.

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Peter, I can't believe you invited your
old highschool sweetheart over for dinner !

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,800
You think that's bad ?

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Remember when I auditioned to be
David Hasselhoff's car ?

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,800
- Hey there, Knight Rider !
- After those bad guys, Kitt !

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,100
Yeah but dad, why would you invite
an ex-girlfriend to dinner ?

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,000
Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nervous ?

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,700
Like when I had to sell pancakes
to this school soccer captain ?

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Pancakes for you, Captain !

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
I'll be the captain, and you'll be Tennille.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,100
<i>Love will keep us together</i>

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
But, Peter, I don't wanna cook
dinner for your ex-girlfriend !

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
Well, maybe we can just have tea.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,300
You mean like the time you had tea with Muhammed,

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
the prophet of the Muslim faith ?

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,500
Come on, Muhammed,
let's get some tea !

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,800
Try my Mister T... tea.

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,700
Boy, was that ever weird.

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,800
Anyway, I can't believe I invited
my old sweetheart to dinner, huh !

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
That's it ? That's all they did ?

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Oh man, that's not cool !

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
- Seriously, that is not cool.
- Why, what's the big deal ?

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
What's the big deal ?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
You guys, they've just made fun of
the religion of an entire group of people.

85
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,800
What, you guys think that's okay ?

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Do you care at all about people's feelings ?

87
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,200
Since when do you care about being
sensitive to people's religion, Cartman ?

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time !

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's different.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm just a little boy !

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
That's a cartoon.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,700
Millions of people watch it !

93
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
How would you feel, Kyle,
if there's a cartoon on television

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
that make fun of Jews all the time, huh ?

95
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong.

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
It's wrong !

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
It's wroooong !

98
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Kyle ! Kyle what are you watching ?

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,100
Hey Brian, this is like the time
I got a job as a carrot cake.

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
It's <i>Family Guy</i> !
Quick Gerald, do something.

101
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,800
Dad, dad ! Jesus Christ !

102
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,200
It's okay, it's dead.

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show !

104
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,600
Mom, it was nothing !

105
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,700
Muhammad just stood there and drank some tea.

106
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,000
You boys don't understand anything.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,700
It's obvious that you all need Muslim sensitivity training.

108
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,500
Welcome to Muslim sensitivity training.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,300
It is important for us to understand
why the Muslims feel the way they do.

110
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
And why we can never show an image of Muhammed.

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,100
No, Muslims can't show an image of Muhammad.

112
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,000
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,200
Yeah Kyle, maybe you think this is funny

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
but the rest of us don't.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,200
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset.

116
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,300
First of all, in the Muslim religion,
you're not allowed to have what ?

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,200
Sex ! Good !

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.

119
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Now this would be fine except that in
the Muslim religion you also can't... ?

120
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Anybody ?

121
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Jack off !

122
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Okay jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,900
And what do we know about
the places Muslims live ?

124
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
They live in...

125
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Good, sand !

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim,

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,200
it's friday night but you can't have sex
and you can't jack off.

128
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
There's sand in your eyes, and probably in the crack of your ass

129
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,500
and then some cartoon comes along
from a country where people are getting laid

130
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,900
and mocks your prophet !

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Well, you know what ?
I'd be pretty pissed off too !

132
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Mrs Garrison, that is ignorant and racist !

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Muslims are mad because of <i>Family Guy</i>,
not because they can't jack off !

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,300
Right Wendy ?

135
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,600
Yeah !

136
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,800
Attention students, proceed to the school gymnasium immediately

137
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
for an emergency announcement.

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,800
The hell's going on now ?

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,300
Shh, quiet students, quiet !

140
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,500
Once again, we have just learn that the <i>Family Guy</i> episode

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,200
featuring Muhammed,
was only part one of a two-parter !

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,000
And part two is going to air next week,
with Muhammed uncensored !

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,200
What ?

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,300
- Why would they...
- Fox studios claim that

145
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,003
the <i>Family Guy</i> writing staff

146
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:09,007
has demanded the Muhammed
character be seen in full-view.

147
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
The head of Fox had this to say.

148
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,500
<i>Family Guy</i> is our biggest show.

149
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,900
If they insist we don't
censor their work, then we can't.

150
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,200
<i>Family Guy</i> !

151
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
I damn you to hell !

152
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,200
Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East.

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,900
This time even more massive.

154
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
Retaliation !

156
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Oh my God ! M'kay.

157
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,100
Goddamned <i>Family Guy</i> !

158
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,200
Now they're just provoking people,
it's like they want a holy war !

159
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Does this mean
we don't have school all week ?

160
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,400
You guys, this is serious.
We have to do something !

161
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,200
- <i>Like what ?</i>
- We have to go to Fox network in L.A.

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
We have to go and...

163
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
try to get that episode pulled.

164
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
You guys with me ?

165
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Due we can't go anywhere,
they've shutdown the airports and the buses.

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,500
Then we'll ride our big wheels !

167
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,300
- To Los Angeles ?
- If that's what it takes, yes !

168
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,700
We have to talk to the network.

169
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,800
The <i>Family Guy</i> writers
aren't gonna back down !

170
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,500
Well good for them !
They shouldn't.

171
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,400
The writers are standing up and saying
they aren't going to be intimidated.

172
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,100
Intimidated ? Is that what you think
this is about Kyle ?

173
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you ?

174
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't trust for one second that you're sudden
concern for the Muslim people is real !

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,600
All right, fine Kyle. Forget
the Muslim faith for a minute.

176
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
People can get hurt.

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
If ten people die because <i>Family Guy</i>
just had to have their little joke

178
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Will you still think it's funny ?

179
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
What if a hundred people die ?

180
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
Will it be funny then Kyle ?

181
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm going to Los Angeles.

182
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,100
And I'm gonna do whatever I can

183
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,300
to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hands.

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people !

185
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,500
Somebody has to speak for what's right !

186
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,800
Kyle ! Kyle wake up, we have to go !

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
The terrorists are attacking !

188
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,900
Dad, are you sure this time ?

189
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,300
This isn't a joke Kyle.

190
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,600
Bombs have already gone off in six cities !

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,300
No !

192
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Wait a minute ! Where's Ike ?!

193
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,700
He was just here ! Ike !

194
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Ike !

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Ike ? Iiike ! Ike !

196
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,800
Ice cream. I want chocolate.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Ike ! This way !

198
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,300
Kyyyle !

199
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,800
Nooooo

200
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Come to try and stop me ?! It isn't gonna work.

201
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,800
I didn't come to stop you.

202
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
I... I think you're right, Cartman.

203
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,100
I want to help you get the <i>Family Guy</i> episode pulled.

204
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,900
Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.

205
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Especially one who doesn't trust me.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,700
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but...

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,700
I think it's pretty amazing.

208
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,100
And I think it's real.

209
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,400
You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.

210
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah. I do understand, Kyle.

211
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
I've been doing the wrong things for a long time.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Doing things for my own selfish reasons.

213
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
I just wanna do something right, you know ?

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
Just this one time.

215
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help.

216
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,600
We can try and get the episode pulled together.

217
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
You know we might not even make it into the studio.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But just like you, I feel like I have to try.

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
People can really get hurt,

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,700
and a joke just isn't worth that.

222
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,800
So what made you change your mind ?

223
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
I got some sound advice... from an old friend.

224
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,100
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.

225
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah !

226
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,100
- Are you set ?
- I'm set ! Let's do this !

227
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,600
All right, let's roll !

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,700
People ! People, quiet, please !

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,300
We must not panic !

230
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,900
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor ?!

231
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Part 2 of the <i>Family Guy</i> episode airs in six days !

232
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University

233
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,800
has come up with a solution.

234
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Thank you, Mayor.

235
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,400
Now look, everyone.

236
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us

237
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,900
for what <i>Family Guy</i> is going to do...

238
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,600
because they've wrongly grouped us together.

239
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know...

240
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
that we had no part in the Muhammad episode.

241
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,800
That even though the episode aired,

242
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it,

243
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,600
and we didn't talk about it.

244
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,700
So how do we do that ?

245
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,000
We bury our heads. In sand.

246
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,600
We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks,

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,400
fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue.

248
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,900
By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels,

249
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,800
we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes,

250
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
and then have the person to our left bury them.

251
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,500
If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand

252
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
before the Muhammad episode airs,

253
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,000
we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,900
No, no, wait a minute, that's ridiculous.

255
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,600
Look, what we need to do is just the opposite.

256
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see ?

257
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Muhammad,

258
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,800
and show the terrorists and the extremists

259
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,800
that we are all united in the belief that every person

260
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,700
has a right to say what they want !

261
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
Look, people, it's...

262
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
it's been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately.

263
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,700
For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it.

264
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
But those times are going to come !

265
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,700
And one of those times is right now.

266
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,600
And if we... aren't willing to risk what we have,

267
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
then we just believe in free speech,

268
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
but we don't defend it.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,700
I like the sand idea.

270
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,500
Yeah, me too.

271
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler.

272
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,100
- Let's do the sand !
- Yeah, yeah !

273
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,900
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand !

274
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,400
Let's move, people !

275
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
We've got six days to make it to Los Angeles.

276
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,300
If we keep our stops to a minimum,

277
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,600
we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.

278
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now,

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,300
<i>Family Guy</i> will be off the air forever.

280
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,700
Off the air ? But...

281
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,900
we're just going to try to get the Muhammad episode pulled.

282
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,800
It's simple television economics, Kyle.

283
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled.

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims,

285
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,500
then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled.

286
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,100
And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled.

287
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,500
And so on and so on, until <i>Family Guy</i> is no more !

288
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,800
It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.

289
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,100
Whoa whoa wait a minute !

290
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
This isn't what I signed up for !

291
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,500
I like <i>Family Guy</i>.

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Why do we have to get it off the air forever ?

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,700
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and... and that's wrong.

294
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,800
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air.

295
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like <i>Family Guy</i>.

296
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,500
Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to <i>Family Guy</i> !

297
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,600
You hear me Kyle ??!!

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
Compare me to <i>Family Guy</i> again,

299
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,100
and so help me I will kill you where you stand !

300
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,500
You unbelievable son of a bitch.

301
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,700
You never cared about the Muslim religion

302
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
or the safety of people in America.

303
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,200
You just want <i>Family Guy</i> off the air !

304
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,700
Do you have any idea what it's like ?!

305
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like <i>Family Guy</i>, right ?"

306
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,600
"Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of <i>Family Guy</i>, Cartman."

307
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,100
I am NOTHING like <i>Family Guy</i> !

308
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,600
When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story !

309
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,500
Deep, situational and emotional jokes

310
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
based on what is relevant and has a POINT !

311
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Not just one random interchangeable joke after another !!

312
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
What are you talking about ?!

313
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND !

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side.

315
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,100
You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.

316
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now.

317
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,800
No biggie.

318
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,300
I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled !

319
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,000
No ! I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend...

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,700
to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air !

321
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,200
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw ?

322
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
What ?

323
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
CARTMAN !

324
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,600
Kyle, stop it !

325
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Holy Crap !

326
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,700
Stay on 'em !

327
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,900
Jesus and Mary !

328
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,400
If you have children,

329
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,500
be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own.

330
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,100
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.

331
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
It's the best way, Stanley.
Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up ?

332
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Yeah.

333
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
All right, make sure your snorkel is working.

334
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
All right, now get your head in the hole.

335
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
Dad, this is stupid.

336
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,500
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity ! Do it !

337
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,600
All right Sharon, now do me.

338
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,700
Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'.

339
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,200
If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left,

340
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
then who's gonna bury the last person's head ?

341
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,300
Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and...

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
not have his head in the sand.

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,600
- I'll do it.
- Dylan, no !

344
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
You realize by not burying your head in sand,

345
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,500
you'll appear to be a part of the <i>Family Guy</i> audience.

346
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,900
Yes, I know.

347
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,400
Dylan, please, you can't !

348
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Somebody has to do it, Sarah.

349
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
You run along now and you get your head in the sand.

350
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,100
I'll be all right.

351
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
You have to understand... I'm all she has.

352
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,300
Who are those people ?

353
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
No !

354
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Hahahaha ! So long, Kyle !

355
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,800
You son of a bitch ! I won't let you win ! You hear me ?!

356
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Suck my balls, Kyle !

357
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Are you the network president ?

358
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
Yes, Mr. President.

359
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,500
We need to discuss this <i>Family Guy</i> episode, Mr. President.

360
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Mr. President, my hands are tied.

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,400
The <i>Family Guy</i> writers insist I don't censor Muhammad.

362
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,400
But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security.

363
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,300
They must be reasoned with.

364
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,900
Mr. President,

365
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,800
there's something about the <i>Family Guy</i> writing staff I think you should know.

366
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,300
The race continues.

367
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,800
Cartman reaches the <i>Family Guy</i> Studio

368
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,300
and learns the shocking secret behind the <i>Family Guy</i> writing staff.

369
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
This... explains everything.

370
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
As an entire nation buries its head in sand...

371
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,300
The idea has swept the nation !

372
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,300
But where will we find enough sand for everyone ?

373
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Kyle, quit it ! Quit it, Kyle !

374
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,700
Or will Comedy Central puss out ?

375
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,200

376
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
