00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:11,070
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

2
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:14,406
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

3
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,743
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

4
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

5
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,208
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,545
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

7
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>Episode 10x08
"Make Love, Not Warcraft"</i>

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,349
Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap.
Hey, where are you guys?

10
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,983
We're over here, by the cart.

11
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,439
Okay, I'm back.

12
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,333
Dude! We've been waiting forever!

13
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,423
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!

14
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,871
If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't
have diarrhea all the time, fatass!

15
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:59,391
Hey, I don't need to take
any lip from a frickin' girl!

16
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:01,560
<i>I think Kyle has fake titties, hahaaha.</i>

17
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:02,922
Heheh, totally, heheh.

18
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:05,630
Come on, we have to finish
the quest in Stonehaven.

19
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:08,081
Stan? Staan?

20
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:10,162
Hang on, guys, my dad wants something.

21
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,480
Stan?!

22
00:01:11,688 --> 00:01:12,902
What?!

23
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:14,721
You've been on your computere all weekend.

24
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,012
Shouldn't you go out
and socialize with your friends?

25
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,942
I am socializing, r-tard.

26
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:22,113
I'm logged on to an MMORPG
with people from all over the world

27
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,143
and getting xp with my party using teamspeak!

28
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,483
I'm not a r-tard.

29
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,631
All right, sorry guys.
So where to now?

30
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:35,310
See where I am?
It's this way.

31
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:36,883
Yeah, come on, let's go!

32
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,501
I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!

33
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:44,581
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.

34
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,781
Yeah, it's bullcrap.

35
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:47,361
I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.

36
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:50,352
Oh crap!
It's that guy again!

37
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:52,552
Who is this?

38
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:55,472
This is the guy that kept killing
us after you went to bed!

39
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,302
Get out of here, asshole!

40
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:59,420
He's a way higher level than us.
It isn't fair.

41
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:02,602
It's all right.
He can't kill us unless we agree to duel.

42
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:07,720
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!

43
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,742
You bastard!

44
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,673
Don't you have better things to do
than going online killing people?!

45
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,110
No! I don't want them to start
over at the graveyard!

46
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,452
No!

47
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,872
That son of a bitch!

48
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,390
Who is that guy?

49
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:32,072
Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.

50
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:41,562
World of Warcraft support line.

51
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,523
Yeah, we bought your game
and played it online

52
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:46,231
but every time we log in, some other
player comes in and kills us!

53
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,000
O..ohhh that shouldn't happen.

54
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:49,821
We designed the game so
that players have to agree

55
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:51,703
to a duel before they can kill each other.

56
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:53,203
Yeah, well this guy does it anyway!

57
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,802
He's a Goddamned butthole!

58
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,120
Really?
That's odd.

59
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,893
More people calling in about
their characters getting killed.

60
00:02:58,948 --> 00:02:59,671
Oh no.

61
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:03,882
Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for
that player and ban him from the network.

62
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,112
Better tell the guys upstairs.

63
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,710
Fellow board members, we have a problem.

64
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:14,640
Somebody in the World of Warcraft
is ignoring the World's rules...

65
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:17,803
and is going around killing innocent players.

66
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,463
Why kill innocent players?

67
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:23,060
The game is about finishing quests.

68
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,141
We've got to delete him from the servers.

69
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,570
We can't.

70
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:30,050
Whoever this player is, he has played
World of Warcraft so much

71
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:33,292
that he has reached a level
we thought unreachable.

72
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:36,012
He's actually able to kill our admins.

73
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,702
And he grows stronger every day.

74
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,033
Jesus...

75
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:41,612
I've gotta get home!

76
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:44,113
My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!

77
00:03:44,187 --> 00:03:48,501
Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.

78
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,572
No... no.

79
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:55,162
They just started playing!

80
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,131
What kind of person would do this?

81
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,542
Only  one kind.

82
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:04,230
Whoever this player is, he has played World
of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day

83
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:06,541
for the past year and a half.

84
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:10,640
Gentlemen, we are dealing
with someone here who...

85
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:13,472
has absolutely no life.

86
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:19,260
How do you kill that which has no life?

87
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:26,273
Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?

88
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,952
Not now, Nelson.
I just joined a big party of night elves

89
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,790
and we're gonna explore
the Tower of Azora together.

90
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,310
Is that a computer game?

91
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,173
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG.

92
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:37,830
These are real people I'm playing with.

93
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:41,470
See, I'm a hunter, level 2.
I can chat with all these other people.

94
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,333
I can even wave to this guy, see?

95
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,860
"Hello."

96
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:47,943
In the outside world,
I'm a simple geologist,

97
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:52,783
but in here... I am Valkorn,
Defender of the Alliance.

98
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:57,702
I've braved the Fargo deep mine to feed
it the bloodfish at Jaro d's Landing.

99
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,741
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you.

100
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:06,171
What?

101
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,882
Why?
Why?!

102
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:10,802
My friends...

103
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:13,832
As you all know, some giant butthole
keeps logging onto Warcraft

104
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:15,692
and killing all our characters.

105
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,693
The past four nights we've tried
to play, he shows up and kills us!

106
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:21,263
He killed my character right
in the middle of a quest!

107
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,531
Mine too!

108
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,782
We've learned that the four
of us can't fight him alone.

109
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,820
But, if we all log in together,
we might have a chance.

110
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:29,930
Hey yeah!

111
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,440
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!

112
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:33,483
Are you guys dumb?

113
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,191
We can't beat him, even with all of us.
It's a waste of time.

114
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,700
Dude, we have to try.

115
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,350
I've got better things to do.

116
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,580
Clyde, Clyde! If you had a chance
right now to go back in time

117
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:45,110
and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?

118
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:49,653
I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because
I think he was awesome, but you would, right?

119
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:51,410
I'm just gonna stop playing.

120
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,490
When Hitler rose to power there were
a lot of people who just stopped playing.

121
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:56,061
You know who those people were?

122
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:58,810
The French!
Are you French, Clyde?

123
00:05:58,907 --> 00:05:59,622
No.

124
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,010
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?

125
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,470
All right all right, I'll do it!

126
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,160
So what's the p-plan?

127
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:08,572
All  right, you all login from
your computers at precisely 7:30.

128
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,430
We will meet here, on the plains
of the elven forest near Westfall.

129
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,680
My  friends, to victory!

130
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:15,143
To victory!

131
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,732
I don't play World of Warcraft.

132
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,823
Butters, you said you were
on your computer all the time!

133
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:24,661
Yeah, but I'm playing
Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

134
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:28,570
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft,
install it on your computer

135
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,371
and join the online sensation
before we all murder you.

136
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,453
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright.
All right then.

137
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,632
All right, you guys, this is it!

138
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:46,852
When the attack begins,
all warriors click on defensive stance.

139
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,992
Everyone else, wait for Craig
to cast his intellect buff.

140
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:50,643
Okay.

141
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,553
Got it.

142
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:52,950
The battle is sure to be long

143
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,280
so make sure you all have your special
abilities macroed to your keyboards.

144
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,259
All right, Eric.
You can c-c-count on us.

145
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,443
Timmy!

146
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,683
This shall be a day for all to remember!

147
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,930
Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!

148
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,040
From with-
- Hey fellas!

149
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:10,383
Boy, this is neato, huh?

150
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:14,621
Butters?
What the hell are you doing?

151
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,350
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.

152
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,182
You can't be the dwarf character,
Butters, I'm the dwarf.

153
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:22,203
Well, there's only like four
races to choose from-

154
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,703
So pick another one!
I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole!

155
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,431
Log out, create a new character
and log back in!

156
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,483
I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure
a lot more 'n this stuff.

157
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:31,980
Come on, let's do this!

158
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:35,261
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.

159
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,462
Then let's move out!

160
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,123
Look! There he is!

161
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,373
Everyone hold!

162
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:58,743
He's targeting us.

163
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,343
Prepare to charge!

164
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,963
Scroll over him with your mouse cursors!

165
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:06,022
And... Right-click!

166
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,272
What the?

167
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,110
Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions!

168
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:25,031
I'm burning!
Oh Jesus I'm burning!

169
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:30,141
Kenny's down.
K-k-kenny is down.

170
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,740
I have poop on my pants.

171
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,160
Ike, look out!

172
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,033
Kyle...

173
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:43,531
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!

174
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,352
Hit him now, Clyde!

175
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,882
Clyde?
Clyde!

176
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,180
Clyde! Come on, you guys, move!

177
00:08:51,236 --> 00:08:54,071
Goddamnit we lost Clyde!

178
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:58,270
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys?

179
00:08:58,575 --> 00:08:59,560
Dad?

180
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,331
Yeah, I'm playing from the office.

181
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,103
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!

182
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,070
That's it, I'm dead!

183
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,731
That's it, screw this game!

184
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,480
No, leave me alone,
don't do... that, dugh

185
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,523
God-fucking-damnit!

186
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,151
Oh Jesus...

187
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,742
Oh God no...

188
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,301
What?

189
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:34,943
He just finished killing every single
player in the Arathi Highlands.

190
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:36,912
How many people's characters were in there?

191
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:38,662
Over five thousand.

192
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:43,521
There are over seven million people
who log on to World of Warcraft!

193
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:46,570
Are you telling me all those people's
characters are going to die

194
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,221
and there's nothing we can do to save them?

195
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,352
Yes.

196
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:53,152
And it won't be long before everyone
gets really really frustrated

197
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,993
and stops playing altogether.

198
00:09:55,087 --> 00:10:01,860
Gentlemen, this could very well lead to
the end of the World... of Warcraft.

199
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:04,750
No! Noooo!

200
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,602
What the hell are you guys doing?

201
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:17,102
Don't tell me you all quit playing
World of Warcraft too?!

202
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,670
Dude, we're done.
We're sick of getting killed all the time.

203
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:23,902
Guys, when things look bad, you can't
just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.

204
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:27,532
We don't have a choice, dude.
That guy killed our characters 14 times.

205
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,242
I have a solution, you guys.

206
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,191
That guy can kill us so easily
because he's a super-high level, right?

207
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,703
What if we were super-high level too?

208
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:38,362
We can't get to a higher level because
that dude doesn't let us finish quests!

209
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:42,810
That's why we just need to log in
and stay in the forest, killing boars.

210
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:43,563
Boars?

211
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,711
There's lots of computer-generated boars
in Warcraft that die with just one blow.

212
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:49,222
Dude, boars are only worth
two experience points apiece.

213
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,052
Do you know how many we would
have to kill to get up 30 levels?

214
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,421
Yes.

215
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:56,703
Sixty-five million three hundred and forty
thousand two hundred and eighty five.

216
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,690
Which should take us seven weeks, five days,
thirteen hours and twenty minutes

217
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,422
giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep.

218
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,752
What do you say, guys?

219
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:06,693
You can just, you can just hang outside
in the sun all day tossin' a ball around

220
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,170
or you can sit at your computer
and do somethin' that matters.

221
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:28,542
<i>Live to win, till you die,
till the light dies in your eyes!</i>

222
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:37,000
<i>Live to win, take it all,
just keep fighting till you fall!</i>

223
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:44,311
<i>Day by day, kickin' all the way
I'm not cavin' in</i>

224
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:49,382
<i>Let another round begin,
live to win</i>

225
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,250
<i>Yeah!</i>

226
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,023
<i>Live!</i>

227
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,032
<i>Yeah!</i>

228
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,150
<i>Win!</i>

229
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,821
Sir, you'd better have a look at this!

230
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:03,793
Four of our subscribers...
They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.

231
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:07,182
My God... they must have no lives at all.

232
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:09,582
A hope?
- A chance.

233
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:17,843
<i>Live to win, till you die,
till the light dies in your eyes</i>

234
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:21,452
My mouse-clicking finger hurts.
- Come on, Kyle! You can do it!

235
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:26,173
<i>just keep fighting 'till you fall</i>

236
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:33,372
<i>Day by day, kickin' all the way,
I'm not cavin' in</i>

237
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:40,090
<i>Let  another round begin,
live to win</i>

238
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:43,782
<i>Live to win</i>

239
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:48,613
<i>Live to win</i>

240
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:52,843
<i>Yeah, win</i>

241
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:59,392
The admins tell us they are four players
from a small town in Colorado.

242
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:02,353
Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?

243
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,413
We ran the numbers,
even with their amazing rise in levels

244
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,892
they have a 90% mortality probability.

245
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:09,813
They'd be walking in a slaughter!

246
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:13,240
There has to be someway we can help them.

247
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,500
What about... the Sword of a Thousand Truths?

248
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,051
Quiet, Thomas!
We aren't even to speak of that sword!

249
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:24,343
But maybe these new players are
the ones the prophecy foretold of.

250
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,672
It is not an option!

251
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,461
What is this sword?

252
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,591
Long ago,
when the World of Warcraft was created

253
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:34,110
one of the programmers put a sword,
called the Sword of a Thousand Truths

254
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,040
into the game inventory.

255
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,652
Apparently it could cause
120 damage per second,

256
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:42,931
with an instant mana burn and an
enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.

257
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:47,242
But the sword was considered to be
too powerful for anyone to possess.

258
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:52,061
So it was removed from the game
and stored on a one-gig flash drive.

259
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:55,940
But it was foretold that one day
players who could wield the sword

260
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:57,860
might reveal themselves.

261
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,750
Who foretold this prophecy?

262
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,453
Soltzman. He's an accountant.

263
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:19,203
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.

264
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:24,050
We must get this sword to the ones
who have proven they have no life.

265
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:28,023
Let's just hope to Christ they don't
start the battle before we can reach them.

266
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:31,872
All right, you guys.
The Moment of Truth is here.

267
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:35,893
It is time for our final battle.
Everyone, log in!

268
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,353
I'm in.

269
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,710
Me too.
- Me too.

270
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,172
Everyonen equip healing potions to
the hotbar if you haven't already.

271
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:46,813
Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance
to raise our intelligence.

272
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:49,250
Hang on, I'm chaining my
fire spells for max range.

273
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,371
N ice.

274
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,872
Stan, what enchantment does
your Cloak of the Tiger have?

275
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,403
Plus 15 agility.

276
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,473
Give the cloak to Kenny.
He needs the agility boost for bow attacks.

277
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,271
Okay.

278
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:02,163
Hold on, this fight could last more than
twelve hours. What if we run out of food?

279
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,100
Don't worry, I have that covered.

280
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:04,891
Mom?

281
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:05,890
Yes, hon?

282
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:07,283
More Hot Pockets!

283
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:08,693
Right away, hon.

284
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,381
That's übercool.

285
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,680
All right, everyone ready?

286
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:12,843
Ready.
- Ready.

287
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,933
Let's go get him!

288
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,483
Wait, I think I see him.
Yeah, yeah he's here in Goldshire.

289
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:30,131
Okay, everyone open your uplifts
and autolocate to Stan.

290
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,681
What's the autolocate macro?

291
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,362
Command zero.

292
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,653
Okay, right behind Stan.

293
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:38,990
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura.

294
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,841
At that moment,
I will use intimidating shout.

295
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,512
Okay, he sees us.

296
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:47,611
He's targeted us.

297
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,751
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.

298
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:52,653
Casting... there's an 8-second cast time.

299
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:54,532
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?

300
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,653
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.

301
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:57,853
Christ.

302
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,022
Cast summon again.

303
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:02,081
Everyone target the scorpions.

304
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:24,433
Yes?

305
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:29,080
We are looking for a great knight
by the name of lovestospooge.

306
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,782
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.

307
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:32,950
Where is he?!

308
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:33,903
Who are you?

309
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:35,703
Sir, we don't have time!

310
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,261
We just heard from our admins that
your son's party is already in battle!

311
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:43,872
Unless they have this sword,
your son's character is going to die!

312
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,820
Nn-Oh my God!

313
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:53,861
Kyle! Fire spell!

314
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:56,922
Kyle?

315
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,280
Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?

316
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,130
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel!
It's aaaah!

317
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,801
Oh Jesus, he's got it bad!

318
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,242
Wait, we need Ben-Gay.

319
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:13,471
Hurry, dude!

320
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,230
I'm going as fast as I can!

321
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,550
Kyle, you have to keep playing.

322
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,713
I can't.
Just leave me behind.

323
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:21,053
We can't do this without you!
Now come on!

324
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,270
Stan?! Stan!

325
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,003
Sharon, where is Stan?!

326
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:29,450
I don't know. He took his computer
somewhere to play that stupid online game.

327
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:30,653
Stupid?

328
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:31,383
Where?!

329
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,822
I don't know.

330
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:35,833
Sharon, his character is going
to die if we don't get to him!

331
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:36,731
So what?

332
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,431
So what?!

333
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,193
We're too late.
Without the sword the players will fail.

334
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:45,401
If we could get to a computer,
we could sign on to the World of Warcraft

335
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,703
and give the boys the sword online.

336
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:50,023
I don't have a World of Warcraft account.
Do you?

337
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,340
No, I have a life.

338
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,422
Give me the sword.

339
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,221
You?

340
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:56,753
I have a Warcraft character.

341
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:59,731
I'm a newb, but I can log on
and get the sword to Stan online.

342
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:02,983
We can't trust the Sword of a
Thousand Truths to a newb!

343
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:04,913
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice!

344
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:06,841
Give me the sword.

345
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,592
Come on, we've got to get
to a computer that works!

346
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:17,842
Where's your car?

347
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,112
We took a cab here!

348
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,572
Damnit, mine's in the shop!

349
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:22,920
Uh hey!
Eh help! Stop!

350
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:25,972
Please, it's an emergency!

351
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,572
Come on!

352
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,752
Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over
and use your computer!

353
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:36,303
No, I d- I need to play World of Warcraft!

354
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:37,383
Nelson!

355
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:46,912
All right,
major stone shield potions should be...

356
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:51,160
Oh God, I'm going to have
diarrhea again. Ohhh-... Duuuh-...

357
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,882
You can't go to the bathroom,
you're stacking sunder armor!

358
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:55,721
It's okay.

359
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:57,493
Mom?
Bathroom!

360
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:58,492
What hon?

361
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:00,993
Bathroom!
Bathroom!

362
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:09,373
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he?

363
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:14,361
All  right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the
mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.

364
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,600
World of Warcraft! I need to play!

365
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,452
Our demo is set up right over by the-

366
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:28,783
Got to... sign in... character name...

367
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:29,912
All right, I'm in!

368
00:19:30,598 --> 00:19:32,073
Dude, I'm almost dead.

369
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:33,821
Kyle, cast arcane missile!

370
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,763
I'm out of mana, I told you.

371
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,910
I've gotta heal.

372
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,363
Staaan!

373
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,123
Dad?
Not now!

374
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,411
Stan!
I've been sent here to bring you this.

375
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:49,921
This sword can completely drain his mana.

376
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:51,291
Dad, how did you get that?

377
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:53,313
No time!
Just take it!

378
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,890
Here!

379
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:00,263
How, how do you hand something
from one player to another?

380
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:03,723
Bring up your inventory screen, Control-I.
- Okay.

381
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,341
Stan, what the hell are you doing?!

382
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:08,811
I got it!

383
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:09,920
Dad!

384
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:11,723
Stan...

385
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,380
Dad, no!

386
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,383
You killed my father.

387
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,042
His shield and armor spells are down!

388
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:25,253
Attack!

389
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:36,310
Looks like you're about to get pwned.

390
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:46,360
Dad? Dad?

391
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,501
Stan...

392
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:52,061
I've never been able
to say this before, but...

393
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,091
I love you, son.

394
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,063
I know you do, Dad.

395
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:04,320
They did it!

396
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:07,541
Our world is saved!

397
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,140
They did it!
They killed him!

398
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:11,881
They did it!
- They killed him!

399
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,870
We can come out!

400
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:16,280
Yes!
- We did it!

401
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:19,310
All right, yay.
- Woohoo! Oh man!

402
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,283
We did it you guys.
We're totally heroes.

403
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,270
That was such über pwnage.

404
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:27,912
I can't believe it's all over.
What do we do now?

405
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,861
What do you mean?
Now we can finally play the game.

406
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,310
Oh yeah.

407
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:37,530
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast
to your hotbar.

408
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:40,583
Stan, check your fury talents
to boost your shots.

409
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:41,613
Got it.

410
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,701
