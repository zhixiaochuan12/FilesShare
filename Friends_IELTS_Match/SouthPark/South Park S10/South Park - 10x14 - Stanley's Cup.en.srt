00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:40,051
Being a delivery boy for the South
Park Gazette is a moble privilege.

6
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,898
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that...

7
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:43,872
I have to get up at 4
a.m. to deliver your paper

8
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:44,963
and then I go to school all day.

9
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:46,641
Oh waaa waaa waaa!

10
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,254
We've all got problems,
pussy! Get used to it!

11
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,427
You aren't delivering
the papers on time!

12
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,537
My bike had a busted
pedal, but I got it fixed,

13
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,250
so there won't be a problem anymore.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,108
Is that your bike out there?

15
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,293
Yeah. Why?

16
00:00:58,293 --> 00:00:59,790
'Cause it's being towed.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,984
What??

18
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,197
Hey hey! What are you doing?!

19
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,915
- This your bike?
- Yes!

20
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:09,129
It's on the impound list. You
owe the county for tickets.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,625
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!

22
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,897
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike.

23
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:17,976
You want it back? You
talk to the county.

24
00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:21,129
No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!

25
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:23,223
Stop, asshole!

26
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,518
Yes? Come in.

27
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:39,812
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh.

28
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:41,353
I was told to come
down here and try to-

29
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:42,671
Yehss! Come on, Mr. Marsh.

30
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,570
I've been told all about your case.

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,838
Impounded bicycle,
$83 owed to the county.

32
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:49,562
Maybe you should get a job.

33
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,544
I got a job, but without my
bike to do my paper route,

34
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,392
I can't make the money! See?

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,195
Stan Marsh is a bright young man.

36
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:03,302
He's got a great family,
a promising paper route;

37
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:07,732
only problem is, his
bike's been impounded!

38
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:15,121
But now, he's about to find out that
getting his bike back isn't so easy.

39
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:20,070
Look, I really need my bike.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,563
Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you,
because then you wouldn't learn anything..

41
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,342
What do I have to
learn?! This isn't fair!

42
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,726
Whoa whoa, hold on.

43
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:31,811
I've looked your case over and I think
maybe we can cut a little deal here.

44
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:35,377
According to your background check,
when you were in kindergarten,

45
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,495
you played on the Park
County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

46
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,455
...Yeah?

47
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:45,410
Well it just so happens that the pee
wee hockey team this year needs a coach.

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,769
Me?

49
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,416
Stan Marsh is a
washed-up fourth grader.

50
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:55,608
He's got no job, no bicycle. And
his only way out is to coach...

51
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,073
a pee wee hockey team!

52
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:04,869
And now, he's about to find out
that to coach, you've got to grow.

53
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,540
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys,
over here? Come over here.

54
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,859
We've got a lot of work to do
and not much time to do it in.

55
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,521
Who are you?

56
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,709
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach.

57
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,010
Now we just need to kind of organize
a little bit and practice our-

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,145
Coach, I have to go pohhtty.

59
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,135
All right, fine, go ahead.

60
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,499
...By myself?

61
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,872
S- hold it a while, okay?

62
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:44,479
What does "passing" mean?

63
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,189
When you shoot the
puck to another player.

64
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,728
My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.

65
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:52,276
Coach, Wooden spit on my forehead!

66
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:53,647
I did not!

67
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,051
All right, all right, shut
up! We're gonna practice!

68
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,581
You two guys play defense,
and you play goalie.

69
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:01,291
I can't play goalie.

70
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,352
Why not?!

71
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:05,687
My doctor says I'm not supposed to.

72
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,296
What, you got asthma or something?

73
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,877
No, he has cancer.

74
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:11,725
What?

75
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:16,311
Nelson has leukemia. It's
already spread to his bone marrow.

76
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:18,802
I don't wanna have cancer!

77
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,926
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.

78
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,346
But why me, coach? Why?

79
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:30,245
Coach, why do people get caaancer?

80
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:32,208
Oh Jesus, can we just practice?

81
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,417
Are we gonna get cancer if
we play with Nelson, Coach?

82
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,633
NO!

83
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,465
Well well well! If it isn't
the Park County Losers!

84
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,990
Oh no! Adams County!

85
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,785
We just thought we'd come check
out the ice for the game tomorrow.

86
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:51,101
Gavin Throttle, coach
of the Adams County team.

87
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,084
Hey.

88
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,977
Look, why don't you just give up?

89
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,350
You can't beat us. You really
want to embarass your players?

90
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,735
Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!

91
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,022
Yeah!!

92
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:03,049
Fine, if that's the way you want it.

93
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,626
See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!

94
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,183
Right! Follow!

95
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:12,880
Coach, please don't let
us lose to Adams County.

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,417
My daddy will beat me again.

97
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,636
Jesus Christ.

98
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:24,247
Stanley, where have you
been?! It's almost bedtime!

99
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,793
Your mother's been worried
sick, and I've been watching TV!

100
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:31,502
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be
able to pay off all the money I owe.

101
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:32,763
Oh, well that's good.

102
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,061
What kind of job?

103
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,437
I'm working with the
Pee Wee Hockey League.

104
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:38,334
...What? With the ..?

105
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:39,595
What whoa wait, Stan.

106
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:42,107
You gave up playing
hockey a long time ago.

107
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,602
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.

108
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,011
Have you forgotten what
happened all those years ago?

109
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,812
Or are you just trying
to make up for it?

110
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,260
What are you talking about?

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,302
Your Pee Wee hockey
game! The Pepsi Center?!

112
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:56,862
In between periods of
the Colorado Avalanche?

113
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,820
I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.

114
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,899
Stan, you can't put your
family through this again!

115
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,398
Whatever your reasons are!

116
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,297
I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed.

117
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,472
What are we goin' to do, Sharon??

118
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,169
What?

119
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,234
Don't you get it?

120
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:13,201
He's getting back into hockey
to prove something to himself.

121
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,434
So he can forget what happened
in that Pee Wee skirmish.

122
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,758
Maybe he doesn't
remember. He was only 4.

123
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:24,667
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it
eats at him every single day.

124
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,171
And we're about out of time here in
another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.

125
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:37,174
And that's # 7, Stan Marsh,
skeating towards the goal, sort of,

126
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:38,818
 but he doesn't have the puck.

127
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:46,806
I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em!

128
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,584
Oh, it appears the goalie
has pooped his pants.

129
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,086
Oh and look at this!

130
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,991
Little Stan Marsh actually
has a shot at the goal!

131
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,899
Ohhhh!

132
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,682
Stan?? Shoot it!

133
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:06,161
Time is running out. Stan
Marsh with a chance to win!

134
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,053
You got it, Stan!

135
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:12,708
Take the shot!! Take the shot!!

136
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,461
NOOOOOOOOOOO!

137
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,894
Ohoooo, that's the end of
the game! How disappointing.

138
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,382
Randy, what's wrong??

139
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:39,972
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible!

140
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,787
It was like I was
living ti all over again.

141
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:49,520
All right, guys. Tonight is our
big game against Adams County.

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,322
We still have all day to practice.

143
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:53,160
Coach? Hey coach.

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,395
Could we talk to you, please?

145
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:59,623
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?

146
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:00,303
Oh

147
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:04,423
Our little Nelson, he's... taken
a turn for the worse, I'm afraid!

148
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:07,723
His cancer is...
real ba-a-a-ad.

149
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,145
Ohhh

150
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:12,602
Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it.

151
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,208
How am I supposed to do it, coach?

152
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,544
How do I look a five year old child in
the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?

153
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:20,504
You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!

154
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:23,549
Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean
to take it out on you, coach.

155
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:26,649
No, I don't mean to take it
out on you, coach. It's just...

156
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,993
I don't know what to say to
him, coach. Neither of us do.

157
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:33,453
What do you say tuh...
somebody who's dying, huh?

158
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:36,853
... I don't know.

159
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:40,522
Will you talk to him,
coach? He looks up to you.

160
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,905
No, I think you oughta.

161
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,923
Nah, I'm just his father.

162
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:48,389
But you're his coach!
You're like a father to him.

163
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,564
Please, coach, he's...

164
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,824
he's counting on you!

165
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,762
Please, coach, he's counting on you!

166
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,972
Oh uh, hey Nelson.

167
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:03,098
Hi, coach.

168
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,106
Dude, I can come back later.
Is this a bad time for you?

169
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:08,749
Yeah, it's a pretty
bad time for me, coach.

170
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:12,156
I'm only five and I'm dying.

171
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,997
Coach, what's it like when you die?

172
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,404
Wugh, I'm not sure.

173
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:23,344
I would... think that... it's a lot
like it was before you were born?

174
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:26,388
How come I have to die now?

175
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,967
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?

176
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,265
Goddamnit, dude, I don't know.

177
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,381
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,964
No, what I mean is,
nobody really knows, see?

179
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:36,956
But everyonen does it.

180
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,473
I mean, it's not like everyone else
gets to live and only you have to die.

181
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:42,924
Everyone's gonnan die.
You feel better now?

182
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,367
I think so.

183
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,178
Okay, great.

184
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:49,439
Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium,
but uh... hang in there? All right?

185
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,202
Thanks, coach.

186
00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:57,173
Will you do me just one favor,
Coach? That game tonight?

187
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:03,405
I'm gonna be watching, so... could
you... make it so I don't have cancer?

188
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,757
No dude, I told you I can't do that.

189
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:10,772
Well then, will you just... win for me?

190
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,313
Okay.

191
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:22,144
Stan Marsh has always
lived a carefree life.

192
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:24,096
But in the blink of an eye,

193
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:28,915
what seemed important before
can all be put in perspective.

194
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:33,278
Stan Marsh is... "Bummin' on Cancer."

195
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:42,015
Welcome, parents, to
this Pee Wee hockey match

196
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:45,135
between Park County and Adams County.

197
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:51,558
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!

198
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,089
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

199
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,477
Come to surrender, coach?

200
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:58,177
Look, there's a kid in
my team who's got cancer,

201
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:00,227
aaand, he wants us to
win this game really bad,

202
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,722
so, could you just...
give us kind of a break?

203
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:05,106
HA! I don't think so, Coach.

204
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:08,294
We're gonna beat you into
the ground, cancer or no!

205
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:12,502
Win! Win! Win! Win!

206
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,537
All right, guys, listen.

207
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,293
I saw Nelson in the hospital,

208
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:21,598
and he asked me one thing: he said he
wanted us to win this game... for him.

209
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:26,855
Sooo, if we lose we're
gonna kill Nelson?

210
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:29,648
Oh Jesus, no!

211
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,544
I don't wanna be a murderer!

212
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:34,312
Relax! If we lose we're
not gonna be murderers.

213
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:37,013
If we lose are we gonna get cancer?

214
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,734
- Oh no
- Ohhh..

215
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:41,892
- Oh no.
- I don't want cancer.

216
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,022
They look pretty strong, coach.

217
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:55,580
I think Nelson's gonna die for sure.

218
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:02,071
Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!

219
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,733
Yeah! Let's go Adams!

220
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,175
Let's go, Park! Come on!

221
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,820
That's it, Brian! Kill him!

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,639
Get near the puck!

223
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:14,251
And that's the end of the
game. The result is a tie.

224
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,023
Tie? Well, what does that mean?

225
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,972
Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all.

226
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:27,429
The big game. A dying
boy's hope. Only problem is,  he tied!

227
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:33,437
And now, he's about to find out
that tying isn't the same as winning.

228
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:37,718
So did we kill Nelson or not?

229
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,315
Hello?

230
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,360
Coach.

231
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,002
How are you feeling?

232
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:47,947
I feel pretty good,
except for the cancer.

233
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,642
Coach? Does God hate me?

234
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:53,978
Oh, hello Coach.

235
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,896
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?

236
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:59,030
Well, he isn't worse, but,
he isn't getting better.

237
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,325
It's almost as if...
his cancer were tied.

238
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,410
Oh boy.

239
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:08,690
Oh. My cancer hurts.

240
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,739
He seems to have put all his
hope into you winning that game.

241
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:15,577
And with a tie, he's in
a kind of... cancer limbo.

242
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:16,918
But what can I do?

243
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,876
Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news!

244
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:24,031
Our hockey team has just been
invited to play against Denver County

245
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,376
during a Colorado Avalanche game!

246
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:29,506
Wow. At the Pepsi Center?

247
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:31,128
Look! He's coming around again.

248
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:34,009
That's our biggest game ever.

249
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,913
Do you think we can win, Coach?

250
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,187
Well, ah, I mean...

251
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:46,947
Imagine. If there was one game, one
chance, to make everything right.

252
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,917
Stan Marsh is being given that chance.

253
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:54,376
But to win, he's gonna have
to pull out all the stops in...

254
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:57,575
"Stanley's Cup"! Rated R.

255
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,448
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.

256
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:07,411
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.

257
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:10,311
Just be aware of this, Coach.

258
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:14,449
If you lose the Big Game, that
little boy is going to die faster

259
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:17,766
than Steve Irwin in a
tank full of stingrays.

260
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:22,535
Coach! What the hell were you thinking?

261
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:25,024
We can't beat Denver County.

262
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,157
Well, sure we can.

263
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:30,909
Last time we played Denver
they scored seven times.

264
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:32,824
Look, guys. I believe in you.

265
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:35,424
Nelson believes in you.
Doesn't that count for anything?

266
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:38,080
No, 'cause they're gonna kill us.

267
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,405
They're not gonna kill us.

268
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,330
That's what Steve Irwin
said about those stingrays.

269
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,039
Haven't you guys ever seen these movies?

270
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,447
We're just supposed to rally together,

271
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,563
believe in ourselves,
and we win in the end.

272
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:54,597
No. In the movies, they always go out

273
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:58,322
and find a kid who's really
good to join the team.

274
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,347
Hey that's right. We need a ringer.

275
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:03,998
We need a Canadian.

276
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,470
Wow, he's good.

277
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,871
Yeah!

278
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,491
Stan, I told you. My mom
doesn't want Ike playing hockey.

279
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,725
She thinks it's dangerous.

280
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,681
It's just for one game. He
won't get hurt, I promise.

281
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:27,860
Yeah!

282
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,192
All right, but it's gonna take more

283
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,191
than one good player to
beat the champions, Stan.

284
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,576
You'd better have a
really good game plan.

285
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,776
Can you believe it,
Stan? The Pepsi Center.

286
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:49,175
You're going back to the
place where it all happened.

287
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:52,566
Same place where you missed
that shot all those years ago.

288
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,205
Dad, I'm working on
my game plan right now.

289
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,163
Ya have to understand why I can't go.

290
00:16:56,163 --> 00:17:01,183
I can't... sit there in that same crowd
and watch you destroy yourself again.

291
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,794
Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why
does it have to be the Pepsi Center?

292
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:13,662
All right, all right, I'll
go. No, no I WANT to go.

293
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,420
I'm gonna be there for you and...

294
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,848
I'll be rooting louder than
anybody, saying "That's my son!"

295
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,921
And just remember, Stan: win or lose.

296
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:30,405
Those are your two
options, Win, or lose.

297
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,968
His shot is blocked! What a great save!

298
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,734
And that's the end of the second
period. The score is tied 2-all.

299
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,441
And now please put your hands
together for three minutes

300
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:02,565
of exhibition play from some of our
state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.

301
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,954
All right, you guys, this
is it. The moment is here.

302
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,357
We've been through a lot together,

303
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:09,228
and according to every movie ever made,

304
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:11,669
we're going to win this game.

305
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:13,811
Just don't forget:

306
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,653
there's a little boy in the
hospital who's really counting on us.

307
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:19,196
So let's not let him
down. Are you with me?!

308
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,186
All right, let's go win!

309
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,271
Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.

310
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,329
Huh?

311
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,038
The other Pee Wee hockey
team didn't show up.

312
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:31,423
There's nobody for you to play.

313
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,158
Thanks for makin' the trip though.

314
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,352
We came to play.

315
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:37,915
Sso then we win?

316
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:40,071
No. Nobody wins.

317
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:41,652
Hey. Hey, you can't do this.

318
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,017
We've, we've been through all
this stupid emotional crap!

319
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,211
Well, you've got nobody to
play, there's nothing we can do.

320
00:18:46,211 --> 00:18:48,052
But it isn't supposed to end like this!

321
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:49,512
Hey, hold on a second.

322
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,883
If these kids have been through
a lot of emotional changes,

323
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:52,885
then they have to play.

324
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:53,729
Yeah

325
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,272
Well, who are they gonna play?

326
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:56,880
They can take our place.

327
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,158
Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.

328
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:00,496
Play the Red Wings?

329
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:04,201
Stan Marsh coaches a
Pee Wee hockey team.

330
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:09,358
But now, they're going to
play in the big leagues.

331
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,451
They've got small bodies but big hearts.

332
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,422
Stan Marsh is... going professional.

333
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:17,642
All right! Give 'em hell, boys!

334
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:18,420
All right! Yeah!

335
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,638
It's a tie game here in Colorado as
we get set to start the final period.

336
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:24,096
Your attention, please:

337
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,190
for this third and final period, the
Detroit Red Wings will be playing...

338
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,475
the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.

339
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:42,532
OHHHHHHHHH!

340
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,981
Jesus Christ!

341
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,054
Stop ! Stop this !
