Friendly faces everywhere

I'm goin out to south park

4
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:20,960
Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor

5
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:24,088
I'm heading out to south park

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:27,425
I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties

7
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:30,761
So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,900
Episode 10x02
"Smug Alert"

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,539
Hey there, Richard!

10
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,935
Oh, hey Gerald.
New car?

11
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,752
Yeah. It's a hybrid.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,673
I just... I just couldn't sit back and be a
part of destroying the earth anymore.

13
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,047
Well... Good for you.

14
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,695
Oho... Thaanks.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,350
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty
Gerald Broflovski.

16
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:03,672
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid
he thinks he's better than everyone else.

17
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,947
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like
yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone.

18
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:15,883
I drive a hybrid,
it's much better for the environment.

19
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:17,036
Thaaanks.

20
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:21,854
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you
got this car is drive around and show it off!

21
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,251
Hey, is that a hybrid?

22
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:27,445
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.

23
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,268
Yeah, I like to be a part of the soluuution
and not part of the probluuhm.

24
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,826
Well, anyway, good for you!

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,221
Thaaanks.

26
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:38,502
Dad, I think Ike is starving to death.

27
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:41,348
Hold on, boys.
We still have to go to the hardware store

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,354
and hand out awareness citations
to SUV cars in the parking lot.

29
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:46,273
What?!

30
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:51,659
Okay, there's another one.

31
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,006
Aw, man! Look at that!

32
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:55,923
Can you believe this?!

33
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,826
An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!

34
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,006
"Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler."

35
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,766
Dad, can we go home, please?

36
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:06,175
Look, there's a Jeep over there!
Go write them a ticket, Kyle!

37
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:08,092
But Dad, I want-
- Now, Kyle!

38
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,979
Oh hey Kyle.
- Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?

39
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,802
Helping my Dad pick out some cool
new power tools. What are you doing?

40
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,681
Helping my Dad give people fake tickets.

41
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:20,674
What's this?

42
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:22,938
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.

43
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:23,855
A ticket?

44
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,396
"Failure to care about the environment."

45
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,649
Oh Goddamnit, did you do this, Gerald?!

46
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:32,153
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make
people more aware you know, it's a-

47
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:35,405
You got some nerve, you know that?!
Where do you come off ticketing people?!

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,723
Well, Randy, calm down.
It's not a real ticket.

49
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,487
I know it's not a real ticket!!

50
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,605
Broflovski, did you put
this crap on my windshield?!

51
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,705
Jimbo, your truck probably gets
less than ten miles to the gallon.

52
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,705
Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!

53
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,025
Dad, let's just go!

54
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,904
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of
South Park aware of a very serious problem.

55
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:56,442
The problem, Gerald,
is that ever since you got a hybrid car,

56
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,859
you've gotten so smug that
you love the smell of your own farts!

57
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:04,658
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was
"high and mighty" to care about the earth!

58
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:08,870
And that too! Stop talking with your
eyes closed! That's what smug people do!

59
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,647
Well, I really don't see how
that has anything to do with the-

60
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:13,092
There, like that! Stop that!

61
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:16,419
Who the hell put this faggy
fake ticket on my truck!

62
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,905
All right, that does it!

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,363
Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging
around with these ignorant idiots!

64
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,834
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best
we just do it right away.

65
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,038
Dad.

66
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:35,482
Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well,
we feel that your new car is changing you.

67
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,259
Yes, it certainly is.

68
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:40,554
We're thinking that a lot of people
in town starting tooo...

69
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,609
Take offense.

70
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:44,831
...are starting to take
offense at your actions.

71
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:48,012
We feel like you're starting to becuhhhm...

72
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,928
Alienated.

73
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:53,144
...star-starting to become alienated
from some of your friends.

74
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,464
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.

75
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,977
You do?
- Yes.

76
00:03:57,978 --> 00:04:01,095
A lot of people in town just
aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.

77
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,776
Right!
Okay, good.

78
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,817
And that's why, I've talked it over
with your mother, and

79
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:07,748
...we've decided to move!

80
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,237
What?!

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,264
We need to be where everyone is motivated
and progressive like us!

82
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:19,001
Start getting your things packed, boys!
The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco!

83
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:22,850
Yeah?

84
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:28,894
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over.
Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.

85
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,646
Going away party?
What do you mean?

86
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:33,165
Well don't you know?
Kyle's movin' away.

87
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,998
Moving away?
Kyle can't move away!

88
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,318
Well he is.
- Where's the going-away party?

89
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:39,596
At Cartman's house.

90
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:44,342
Hey everybody!
There's more pop in the refrigerator.

91
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:47,121
Let's make this the best going-away party ever!

92
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,832
Hey Eric, where is Kyle?

93
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,083
Who?

94
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,108
Kyle, the person leaving.

95
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,128
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?

96
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,922
Dude, a going-away party is suppose
to be for the person who is going away!

97
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,139
Kyle? Kyle!

98
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,014
Kyle's not here.
Cartman didn't invite him.

99
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:02,764
What?!

100
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:07,216
You guys, this is our party. That no-good
back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving!

101
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:10,175
Come on, everyone! Let's sing!
Nanana na!

102
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:13,162
Nanana  na!
Hey hey hey!

103
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,592
Goodbye Kyle!

104
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,442
Kyle! Dude what is going on?!

105
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,397
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.

106
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:22,096
Mr. Broflovski, please.
Kyle's my best friend.

107
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:27,186
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a
small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.

108
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:29,508
Well...  Maybe they'll change.

109
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,973
I wouldn't count on it.

110
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,958
Come on, boys, get in the car!

111
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:34,251
No!

112
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:39,442
Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.
Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars.

113
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:43,734
Until that day, we're just gonna
have to be with our own kind.

114
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:49,549
I will. I will get everyone to
drive hybrid cars! I swear it!

115
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,472
Well? What do you think, huh?

116
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:09,666
Oh Gerald, it's beau-tiful.

117
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,208
Yeah. Now this, is a house.

118
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,611
Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.

119
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,972
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.

120
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:19,596
Welcome to San Francisco.
I'm Peter Thompson.

121
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:23,694
This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis
and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis.

122
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,069
So how do you like the neighborhood?

123
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:28,096
Oh it's gorgeous.
These old houses are so neat.

124
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,916
Yes, well, unlike most cities

125
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:34,306
in San Francisco we try to keep all the
historic houses instead of knocking them down.

126
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:35,416
You in here, Peter?

127
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,667
Oh hay, Paul.
Come on in and meet the Broflovskis.

128
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:40,097
Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue.

129
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,430
This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan

130
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,433
and our daughter,
Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan.

131
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,405
Hello.

132
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,100
We noticed your hybrid out front,
that's a V series, right?

133
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,266
Yeah. That's right.

134
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:53,085
Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna
have to get you into the BT series.

135
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,600
Its emissions are actually cleaner.

136
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,462
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?

137
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,893
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive
and ahead of the curve here in San Franciso.

138
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:05,073
Ahhhm.

139
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,654
Anyway, I'm sure you'll
find it much better here.

140
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:11,995
Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much
more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.

141
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,606
Ahhh, ahh.

142
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,898
We're just a little bit more protective of
our environment here in San Francisco.

143
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,649
Yeah. We sure are.

144
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,692
<i>Come on, people. Come on, people now.</i>

145
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,373
Dude, what are you doing?

146
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:31,577
I'm writing a song about
the importance of hybrid cars

147
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,252
so maybe people will change their ways.

148
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,446
That's gay, heh.

149
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,071
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back.
I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!

150
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,724
Why do you want Kyle back?
Don't you see how awesome it is without him?

151
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,237
You know, Cartman,
you may be stoked now

152
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,612
but I bet you're gonna find that
without Kyle around to rip on

153
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,654
your life is empty, and hollow.

154
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,985
Psh! Whatever dude.
I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters.

155
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,805
Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!

156
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,013
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew.

157
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:04,683
<i>Come on, people. Come on, people now.</i>

158
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,114
All right, all you dreamers and creamers
out there out there in South Park

159
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:15,678
I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that
really made me think about my impact on the earth.

160
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:20,205
This is Stan Marsh with "Hey, People,
You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"

161
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,538
<i>Come on now, people now people now</i>

162
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,608
<i>People now, come on now, people now</i>

163
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,622
<i>Got to drive hybrids, people now</i>

164
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,678
<i>People now, people now, people now</i>

165
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,713
<i>Hybrids are for people now, people now</i>

166
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:32,716
<i>Group of people driving people now</i>

167
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,349
<i>Get a hybrid, be good people now.</i>

168
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,543
He's right.

169
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:38,816
<i>We have all got to be people now</i>

170
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,881
<i>People-driving-hybrid people now</i>

171
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,904
<i>People now, people now, hybrid now</i>

172
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:44,931
<i>Hybrid-people-driving people now.</i>

173
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,931
<i>Come on, people, let's be people now</i>

174
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,056
<i>Hybrid-people-driving people now</i>

175
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,959
<i>Come on, everybody be people now.</i>

176
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:55,082
Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?

177
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:58,731
Yeah, I just wanted to try
to set an example, you know?

178
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,495
Yeah, I guess it's up to us to show
everyone the way. Good for you!

179
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,454
Thaaanks.

180
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,708
Can you believe some people
still don't drive hybrids?

181
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:13,805
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello?
This is simple stuff here. Gawl"

182
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,991
Well from now on, I'm only going to
associate with other hybride-car drivers.

183
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,853
Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?

184
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,794
Good for you!

185
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,398
Thaaanks!

186
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,938
At least we're smart enough to know better!

187
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,218
Thaaanks!

188
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:33,300
<i>Come on, everybody be people now.</i>

189
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,675
And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh

190
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:42,163
for making South Park the city with the highest
percentage of hybrid owners in the country!

191
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:47,372
If only the rest of the country
was as insightful as we are.

192
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,696
Ah, thanks.

193
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:51,973
I was really just trying to make it
so my friend can move back here so...

194
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,501
if you don't mind,
I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now.

195
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,293
Great speech!

196
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,120
Yeah, well, you know my son is just
a little bit more clever than some.

197
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,772
Hello  there, I'm Ranger McFriendly.

198
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,355
I'm the person who watches over
the delicate ecosystem of South Park.

199
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,546
You must be the little boy who wrote that song.

200
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:12,310
Yeah.

201
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:16,518
You son of a bitch!
Do you have any idea what you've done?!

202
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,171
What?!

203
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,750
Come  with me!

204
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,028
There! Look!

205
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:26,061
Smog? There's never been
smog over South Park before.

206
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,269
Don't you get it?!

207
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,074
When people drive hybrid cars

208
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:33,927
they get so full of themselves they spew
tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air!

209
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:37,510
That isn't smog, it's smug!

210
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,205
Smug?

211
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:42,198
Hybrid cars make better for emission levels

212
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:45,378
but people who drive hybrid cars
are the leading cause of smug.

213
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,045
You can have smug in the atmosphere
and you know what that leads to?

214
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,198
Global laming!

215
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:54,573
Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is
now the secong smuggiest city in America!

216
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,664
<i>This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!</i>

217
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,789
It looks like we have
a smug alert here in South Park.

218
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,461
Our own Keenan Williams has the details.
Keenan?

219
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:09,502
Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in
effect at least tomorrow morning.

220
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,095
All those hybrid cars on the
road have caused heavy smug

221
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:15,137
to develop over most of Park
and Jefferson Counties.

222
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,331
On the national map

223
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:20,477
we can see smug over Denver
and developing smug in Los Angeles.

224
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:24,769
However, San Francisco is once again
the smuggiest city in the country.

225
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:31,610
<i>A smuggy day in San Francisco town.</i>

226
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:37,567
Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian, yet?

227
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,622
No! Hello, how are you?

228
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:41,872
Really good, really good.

229
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,830
Hey there. Alan, right?

230
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,344
Actually, it's Alain.

231
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,877
Right right, w-would,
would you like red or white wine?

232
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,779
Can I just get an empty glass?

233
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,168
Oh. Sure.

234
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,715
Can you believe all these imbecils in Texas?

235
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,687
They just put another prisoner to death.

236
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:04,640
So...

237
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,890
what do you do for fun?

238
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,321
We drink and take drugs.

239
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,168
You want some acid?

240
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:13,157
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.

241
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:16,567
You will. There's a reason most
San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.

242
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,601
It's the only thing that allows
us to deal with our parents

243
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,310
all walking around loving the smell
of their own farts all the time.

244
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,351
Everthing okay in here, Kyle?

245
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,626
Yeah, fine, Dad.

246
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,848
So much better here with
the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?

247
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,694
Mmmm.

248
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,514
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.

249
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,174
I want three.

250
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:43,855
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing
for Broflovski in San Francisco!

251
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:44,947
They just moved there!

252
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:49,394
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs
can't even play video football!

253
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,322
Yeah. You're right.

254
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,757
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.

255
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,368
Well I'm sorry. Well it shows that
I'm not Jewish, and now th-

256
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:00,906
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!

257
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,118
Marsh!

258
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,867
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.

259
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,493
Who?

260
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,215
You'd better come with me to the news station!
Our situation just got a lot worse!

261
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:13,732
noticed it on the computer this morning.
Look here.

262
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:19,049
This is the smug over South Park.
It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.

263
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,200
The  smug?

264
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:23,131
The smug is getting so massive
that it's moving west...

265
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:26,599
and fusing with the San Francisco smug...
Here.

266
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,738
These two smug clouds are
combining, fueling each other.

267
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,183
Now take a look at this.

268
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,183
What is that?

269
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,040
It's the smug from George Clooney's
acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.

270
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,773
George Clooney's acceptance speech?

271
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,703
Did you hear it?

272
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:42,120
He talked about how people in Hollywood
are ahead of the curve on social mattes.

273
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,251
He even took credit for
the Civil Rights movement -Look!

274
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,321
The point is...

275
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:49,932
the smug from his acceptance speech has
been slowly drifting north since he gave it...

276
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:52,112
and is headed straight for the supercell.

277
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:55,939
The South Park and San Francisco
smug is already at critical mass.

278
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:59,050
If it gets hit by George Clooney's
acceptance speech

279
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,828
it will be a disaster of epic proportions.

280
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,633
The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.

281
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,607
We've got to tell the townspeople!

282
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,135
South Park still has a chance
to make it through the storm!

283
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,550
What about San Francisco?

284
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:17,733
Kid, thanks to your gay little song,
there's not gonna be a San Francisco.

285
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:21,356
Soo, that's it people.

286
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:25,759
When the smug from George Clooney's speech
hits the San Francisco and South Park smug

287
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,914
we're gonna witness a storm the
likes of which we've never seen.

288
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:33,192
Are you trying to tell us the smug from
our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?

289
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,581
If the smug clouds remain
the way they are, yes.

290
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,958
This is all Stan's fault!

291
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,680
He wrote that gay little song and
got us to drive those damned hybrids!

292
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,226
Yeah. Good going, stupid!

293
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:54,004
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's
fault, there is still something we can do.

294
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:57,115
If we all work together to reduce smugness

295
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:00,647
we might be able to lessen the effects of
the storm, at least here in our own town.

296
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,174
Then that's it.
There's only one way to reduce smugness.

297
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,562
We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town!

298
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:11,256
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's!

299
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,531
Hey, where do you think you're going?!

300
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,378
I'm gonna try and warn Kyle
to get out of San Francisco.

301
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,602
Oh no you're not!

302
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:22,032
Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids,
you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!

303
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:25,213
How long do we have until
the smug clouds collide?

304
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,174
Not long.

305
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:30,633
The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards
Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.

306
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,800
The hell is that?

307
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,398
<i>"Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive"</i>

308
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,343
Wow, Eric.
You sure are a great guy for doing this.

309
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:06,499
I don't have a choice.

310
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,276
Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn
Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.

311
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,234
But... how come we can't
just take the bus on into the city?

312
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,974
You don't know San Francisco, Butters.

313
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,251
It was the breeding ground for
the hippie movement in the 60s.

314
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:20,817
Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists
and diehard modern hippies young and old.

315
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:25,194
I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco.

316
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,344
God help me.

317
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,785
All right, Butters,
I'll be tethered to you through this cord.

318
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,452
It's my only lifeline,
so make sure it stays taut.

319
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,788
If you stop hearing my voice,
for the love of Christ

320
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:40,371
start reeling me in with all your strength.

321
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:43,468
I will. You're really great for
going to warn Kyle, Eric.

322
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,121
I'm not doin' it for Kyle.

323
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:48,542
I can't believe I'm actually going
to walk through San Francisco.

324
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,653
Well, here it goes.

325
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,079
All right. All right,
now get it into the masher! Hurry up!

326
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,432
Can't somebody else opeate this?
I can't really reach.

327
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:09,751
Well then you shouldn't have written
that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!

328
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,539
Keenan, we've gotten rid of half
the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!

329
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,941
They're dropping, slowly,
but... but we're running out of time!

330
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:33,447
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more
of a European city, like Paris or Milan.

331
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,126
Butters, are you there?!
- I'm here, Eric.

332
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:39,898
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a
quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?

333
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:44,412
You must be nearing Union Square.
Did you see a fountain to your left?

334
00:17:44,745 --> 00:17:47,231
Yes. It's just beyond yet
another wine and cheese store.

335
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,707
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right.
You've got to start heading west.

336
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:52,901
Turning right at O two four niner.

337
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,638
That's  it. That's that the last one.

338
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,568
Keenan?
Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!

339
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:10,189
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech
is about to hit the other smug system!

340
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:12,064
Get everyone inside!

341
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,861
God help us.

342
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:34,723
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here!
2419 Castillo?!

343
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:39,362
That's it! Eric, hurry!
Somethin's goin' on out here!

344
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,764
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski,
there a smug storm! We have to go!

345
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,639
Being smug is a good thing.

346
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,183
Oh my Christ!

347
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,280
Kyle? Kyle!

348
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:59,959
The acid.
Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.

349
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,917
I'm totally tripping balls.

350
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:06,319
I'm totally tripping balls.

351
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:08,305
We have to get out of here!
Now!

352
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:11,918
Kyle!

353
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:15,168
Kyle!

354
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:27,020
<i>And now, the worst appears to be over.</i>

355
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:30,774
<i>Last night's smug storm...
has left thousands homeless.</i>

356
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:35,708
<i>All across the Midwest,
people are picking up the pieces.</i>

357
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:39,198
<i>Cities like Denver and South Lake
are heavily damaged</i>

358
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:40,364
<i>but still all right.</i>

359
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:43,982
<i>However, San Francisco, I'm afraid...</i>

360
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,440
<i>has disappeared completely up its own asshole.</i>

361
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:49,926
No.

362
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm sorry, Stan.

363
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:55,491
I'm sorry your gay little
song killed your friend.

364
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,735
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it!

365
00:19:59,735 --> 00:20:00,915
You've gotta come see.

366
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,568
What?
- It's a miracle!

367
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:07,708
Kyle!

368
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,035
Hey Stan.
- Dude, what happened?

369
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:12,377
We don't know. We were all passed out and...

370
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:15,744
next thing we know we just
woke up on a bus heading here.

371
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:18,786
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay?

372
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,520
Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.

373
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:26,283
So I guess there's nothing
left to do now but... rebuild.

374
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,380
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.

375
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:32,883
And let's make sure nobody
gets a stupid hybrid, right?

376
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,973
No! Hybrid cars are a good thing!

377
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:41,226
But hybrid cars are the
leading cause of smug, m'kay?

378
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,426
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.

379
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:51,396
Look, hybrid cars are important.
They may even save our planet one day.

380
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:55,730
What you all need to do is just learn
to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.

381
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,454
You mean...

382
00:20:58,454 --> 00:21:02,854
drive in hybrids... but not act like we're
better than everyone else because of it.

383
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:03,729
Yeah!

384
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm...
I'm not ready...

385
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,436
I don't think I can do it either.

386
00:21:09,546 --> 00:21:11,421
It's simply asking too much.

387
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:17,069
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive
hybrids without being smug about it.

388
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:21,573
But for now...
the technology is just too much for us.

389
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,999
Come on, everybody!
Let's go buy wasterful gas guzzlers!

390
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:30,541
Well, looks like you're
back for good, huh Kyle?

391
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:31,819
Yeah, I guess so.

392
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:34,988
We just can't get rid of you, can we,
you sneaky Jew rat!

393
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,668
Don't belitle my people, you fucking fatass!

394
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,408
Ah, that's better.

395
