5
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,760
Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn!

6
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:41,518
Oh, for the love of God,
how much longer?!

7
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:44,094
There you are, Eric.
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:46,282
I'm waiting for the new
Nintendo Wii to come out.

9
00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:48,396
When does it come out?

10
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:49,380
Three weeks.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,928
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

12
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,380
It's time for school.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,352
No Mom, you don't understand!

14
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:57,912
I've been waiting for this
thing to come out for months.

15
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:01,116
And now, every day
time is slowing down.

16
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:05,753
It's like... waiting for
Christmas... times a thousand.

17
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,884
Eric, you're just going
to have to be patient.

18
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,411
Noo!! Nooo!!

19
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,112
Principal Victoria, it is wrong!

20
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,681
It is wrong and I simply will not do it!

21
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:22,064
I care about my students, and I
will not fill their heads with lies!

22
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,327
I am NOT teaching
evolution in my class!!

23
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:28,848
Mrs. Garrison, evolution
is in the school curriculum.

24
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:30,102
We have to teach it.

25
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:34,958
Evolution is a theory! A hare-breained
theory that says I'm a monkey!

26
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,914
I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!

27
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:45,045
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution
has been pretty much uhhh... proven.

28
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,130
I warn you, Principal Victoria!

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,173
Those students are not
prepared to hear this stuff!

30
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,780
Our students want to
learn, Mrs. Garrison,

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,152
and they're mature
enough to handle anything.

32
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,745
How long until Nintendo
Wii comes out now?!

33
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,121
It's still three weeks.

34
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,351
Oh God...

35
00:02:03,846 --> 00:02:05,410
Okay, how long now?

36
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,220
Will you shut up already?!

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,287
All right kids, it is now my job to
teach you the theory of evolution.

38
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,918
Oh boy!

39
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:18,951
Now I, for one, think evolution
is a bnuch of BULLCRAP.

40
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:21,983
But I've been told I
have to teach it anyway.

41
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:25,605
It was thought up by Charles Darwin
and it goes something like this:

42
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:28,616
In the beginning we were all fish. Okay?

43
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,349
Swimming around in the water.

44
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,871
And then one day a couple
of fish had a retard baby,

45
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,986
and the retard baby was
different, so it got to live.

46
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:41,789
So Retard Fish goes on to make more
retard babies, and then one day,

47
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:47,035
a retard baby fish crawled out of the
ocean with its mutant fish hands...

48
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:51,400
and it had buttsex with a squirrel
or something and made this.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,874
retard frog squirrel, and then that
had a retard baby which was a...

50
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,770
monkey fish-frog...

51
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,987
And then this monkey fish-frog
had buttsex with that monkey, and..

52
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:05,757
that monkey had a mutant retard baby
that screwed another monkey and...

53
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:07,417
that made you!

54
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,213
So there you go!

55
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:14,229
You're the retarded offspring of five
monkeys havin' buttsex with a fish-squirrel!

56
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,092
Congratulations!

57
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:20,846
HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!

58
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:24,750
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.

59
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,289
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!

60
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,277
Look, kid, for the fortieth time,

61
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:37,973
pacing in front of the store isn't
gonna make the Wii come any faster.

62
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,912
Eric, you're coming home right now!

63
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,552
Can't I just stay and... look
at the sign a little longer?

64
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:47,233
It's almost bedtime. If you
sleep then time'll go by faster.

65
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,315
Oh God!

66
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:39,110
Agh! That does it!! I am
not waiting three weeks!!

67
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,997
You guys! You guys!
You guys, you gotta help me.

68
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:44,323
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.

69
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:45,690
I can't take it anymore, you guys.

70
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,413
The wait for Nintendo Wii
is literally killing me.

71
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,005
Well there's nothing you can do,
so you just have to be patient.

72
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,736
No. There is something I can do.

73
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:54,633
(What?)

74
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,231
All right, listen: you
know how in space movies

75
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,580
they put astronauts in suspender animation
so that their trip seems really short, right?

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,291
I think I figured out how to do it.

77
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,099
Do what?

78
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,301
Freeze myself.

79
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,254
If I freeze myself, then in three weeks,

80
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:09,088
when Nintendo Wii comes out,
you guys can unfreeze me.

81
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,482
The wait will seem instantaneous to me.

82
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:13,182
No.

83
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,578
It's simple science, Kyle.

84
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:15,974
You'll die, retard!

85
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,618
I'll die waiting for
the Wii to come out!!

86
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,146
Don't you see this is my only chance!!

87
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:20,155
Dude, no way.

88
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,053
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm
not going to help kill you.

89
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,245
I thought you were my
friends! I guess I was wrong!

90
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,576
After everthing we've
been through together,

91
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,429
you guys won't even
help me freeze myself!

92
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:34,418
Principal Victoria, we are
a devout Catholic family!

93
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,055
Do you mind telling me why my daughter
now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!

94
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,524
I told you this would happen, didn't I?!

95
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,421
Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-

96
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:47,752
We have worked years to instill the
teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter,

97
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:51,130
and in one fell swoop, you try
to destroy everything we did!

98
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,056
I hear ya.

99
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:55,037
Sir, if you don't wish your
daughter to learn about evolution,

100
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:56,656
then we can pull her out of class.

101
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,121
You most certainly will!

102
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:00,259
But Dad, I want to learn everything.

103
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,751
No you don't! Shut up!

104
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,828
Well, I told you. We should leave
evolution out of the classrooms.

105
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,287
It has become obvious to me
that you don't know enough

106
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:13,664
about evolution to teach it! I'm
having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins!

107
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:15,328
Re-replaced??

108
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:18,965
Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned
evolutionary scientist.

109
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:21,676
Charmed to meet you. Ms...

110
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:25,355
Shut up, faggot! Principal
Victoria, I can teach my own class!

111
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:29,416
You are to sit in class and help
Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!

112
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:38,048
Over billions of years life has
evolved from simple one-celled organisms

113
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:41,610
into all the complex
life we see around us.

114
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,216
Whatever.

115
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:46,016
It was changes in hereditary traits

116
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,856
that allowed the first
mammals to breath in the air.

117
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,768
Retarded fish-frogs.

118
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:54,065
Ms. Garrision, I believe that's
a gross over-simplification.

119
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,799
Well, you're a faggot!

120
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,257
Continue.

121
00:06:57,257 --> 00:07:02,079
You see, children, life has the
amazing ability to change, to adapt.

122
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,974
Like changing us to the
point that we walk upright.

123
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:08,065
So you are saying that
we're all related to monkeys.

124
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,987
Well yes, basically, we are.

125
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,730
Do you see monkeys at the zoo?!

126
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,271
They crap in their hands
and throw it at people!

127
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:18,211
Ms. Garrison, this isn't
theory, it is scientific fact!

128
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,517
What about the fact that
if I believe in this crap,

129
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,054
you're gonna go to hell?!

130
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,695
Doesn't that bother you a little?

131
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,774
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.

132
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:31,640
AHA! I've got you, you snake
in the grass!! I found you out!!

133
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,503
I never covered it up.

134
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:37,107
And if I'm a monkey, then I might
as well act like a monkey, huh?!

135
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,975
What on earth are you doing??

136
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,711
Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!!

137
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,229
AAAH!

138
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,671
Principal Victoria, I was simply
trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins

139
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,374
about the incongruity of
some scientific statements.

140
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,043
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling
you out of the classroom.

141
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,052
What??

142
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:01,137
Principal Victoria, I really
don't think that's necessary.

143
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:07,879
This woman is very opinionated but,
she does care about her students.

144
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:14,386
Very well. But there is to be no
more throwing of feces. Understood??

145
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,896
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could
I have a word with you, please?

146
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:20,827
What?!

147
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:23,640
Look, I know you think we're at war,

148
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,141
but I want you to know
I admire your passion.

149
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,707
You d-you do?

150
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:33,996
I've never met a woman
with so much... fire

151
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:38,165
Well I... I do bring down a
woman's wrath now and again.

152
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:42,036
So much boldness in
a woman. So beautiful.

153
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm sorry, I'm sure you
have a husband, but I-

154
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,739
No! N-no! My, my
husband is g-gone, dead.

155
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:51,485
Would you then... consider
having dinner with me tonight?

156
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:55,956
Well, well, I suppose we could
have a little steak or something.

157
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,580
I've got a date! I've got a date!

158
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,106
My first real date with a real
man since my sex-change operation!

159
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,261
Oh boy, what'll I wear?!

160
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:10,903
Hey everybody!

161
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,544
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!

162
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,295
Eric, get out of there.

163
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,084
No! No, it's too soon!

164
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:27,138
Now Eric, this has gone far enough!

165
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:29,877
You need to learn to be patient!

166
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,166
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.

167
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:35,665
Go where?

168
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,486
You're gonna help me freeze myself.

169
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,935
Okay. 

170
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,509
Well, how come we've gotta
come all the way out here?

171
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,330
Butters, if anyone else
comes upon my frozen body,

172
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,759
they'll try to unfreeze me right away.

173
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,066
I have to be hidden.

174
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,976
That's good.

175
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,031
And no matter what happens, Butters,

176
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,168
you are not to unfreeze me until the day
the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!

177
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:11,436
Eric, are are you sure
this is a good idea?

178
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:14,371
No, it's not a good
idea. It's an awesome idea

179
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,951
Yeah...I guess it is...

180
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,311
All right, you got the spot figured out?

181
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,835
You're not gonna lose where I am, right?

182
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,502
I got it. Big Tree. Oval Rock.

183
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,550
All right, now get out of here.

184
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,370
You can't freeze too, or
else we're both screwed.

185
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:31,268
Get out of here, you asshole!
You're gonna ruin everything!

186
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,481
Oh jeez!

187
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:41,456
Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.

188
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:45,577
So I told my gynecologist,

189
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:49,404
<i>you put so many things in my
vagina, maybe I should charge you!</i>

190
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:54,985
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most
outspoken woman I have ever met!

191
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:57,363
It's almost like you're one of the guys.

192
00:10:57,363 --> 00:10:59,367
Hehyeah, almost.

193
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,551
You have so much spunk, so much life...

194
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,024
If only you were an atheist.

195
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:10,911
Well... Well, you know,
I'm... I'm open to stuff.

196
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:15,390
Why is someone as outspoken as you given
themselves over to the whole God thing?

197
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,068
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally
into the whole God thing. I just...

198
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:23,519
I just think, you know,
you can't disprove God.

199
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,370
Well what if I told you there
was a flying spaghetti monster:

200
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,632
Would you believe it simply
because it can't be disproven?

201
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:35,806
You're riiight. It's so simple!
God is a spaghetti monster.

202
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:38,902
Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!

203
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:41,147
Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!

204
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,294
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!

205
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:49,164
No, I totally get it now!
Evolution explains everything!

206
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,683
There is no great mystery to life,

207
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,511
just evolution and God's
a spaghetti monster!

208
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,218
Thank you, Richard!

209
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,991
You're so welcome!

210
00:11:56,991 --> 00:11:58,953
Would you like tuh...

211
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,538
head over to my place for dessert?

212
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:07,318
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey!

213
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,306
Give this monkey what she wants!

214
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,746
Oh Ms. Garrison!

215
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:13,161
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard!

216
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:15,213
Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!

217
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:31,505
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming.
I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.

218
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,855
We have a pulse.

219
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,746
Can you... understand me?

220
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:13,763
Where am I?

221
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:17,045
My name is Shvek. You are safe.

222
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,205
Safe where, butthole?!

223
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:23,138
My friend, this is going to
be a bit of a shock, but..

224
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:26,385
it is the year 2546.

225
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,398
What??

226
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:32,495
You have been frozen in
ice for over 500 years.

227
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,416
Butters? Butters, you black asshole?!

228
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,782
Please be careful. You are frail.

229
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,865
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?

230
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,993
Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive
gaming device used in his time.

231
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:55,126
Primitive? It has motion-control
controllers, asswipe!

232
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:57,227
Young man, you don't seem to understand.

233
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:01,017
Your family, your
friends, everyone you knew,

234
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:04,617
has been dead for over 500 years.

235
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:07,326
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!

236
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:10,092
We don't play videogames in our time.

237
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:12,941
There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.

238
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,676
No...

239
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:18,008
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

240
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:22,250
You must understand, children,

241
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,244
that we are dealing with
VERY large numbers here.

242
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,576
That's my man.

243
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,989
So, evolution doesn't
even happen by chance.

244
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:32,158
It is, in fact, bound to happen.

245
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:36,589
That's right, kids. And so
you see, there is no God.

246
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:39,491
Careful darling. The school
board doesn't like it when we-

247
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:40,802
Well there could still be a god.

248
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,491
What?!

249
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:45,278
Couldn't evolution be the answer
to how and not the answer to why?

250
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:50,213
Uh oh, retard alert!
Retard alert, class!

251
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:53,322
Do you believe in a flying
spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!

252
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,088
I wasn't talking about spaghetti.

253
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,432
Come on, you. You're gonna
have to sit in the dunce chair!

254
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:13,297
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what
you did in class today was right.

255
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,483
What?? 

256
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:18,996
But Dick, you told me the world would
be a better place without religion.

257
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:22,847
Yes, but to be so bold about it..

258
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:27,394
I've just never seen a
woman with such... balls.

259
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:32,055
You've just been too soft on
religious people in the past.

260
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,911
Think about it, Richard.

261
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:39,438
With your intellect and my balls, we
can change the future of the world.

262
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,985
Can you imagine a
world with no religion?

263
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:46,182
No Muslims killing Jews, no
Christians bombing abortion clinics.

264
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:50,791
The world would be a
wonderful place... without God.

265
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,548
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick.

266
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:57,317
With me by your side,
there's no stopping you.

267
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,862
Oh, just let me see those
beautiful breasts again.

268
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:03,577
Oh, all right.

269
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,745
Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm.

270
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,909
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!!

271
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:15,425
Quick, General Disarray!
Kill those superheroes!

272
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,634
Pehpew Pehpew!

273
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:21,192
Yes! Now the world shall feel the
wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!

274
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:21,880
Butters?

275
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,323
Butters, you haven't seen Eric
Cartman in the past few days, have you?

276
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,925
Who, me?

277
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,236
It's very importance,
Butters. He's missing.

278
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:32,068
You haven't seen or heard from him?

279
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,683
No ma'am.

280
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,382
Okay.

281
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:37,944
Come on, Professor Chaos!s

282
00:17:37,944 --> 00:17:39,249
Let's destroy this anthill!

283
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:42,287
Geh-General Disarray, can I
ask you a scientific question?

284
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:43,272
Okay.

285
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,669
Well, um, can...

286
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,944
Can anything bad happen if
you completely freeze yourself

287
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,542
and then unfreeze
yourself three weeks later?

288
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:52,498
- ...Yeah.
- Well, like what?

289
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,744
..Like, you die.

290
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:55,839
...Die??

291
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,236
Well yeah. If you freeze
your body, it means you die.

292
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:01,375
When you wake up three weeks later you
can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.

293
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:03,666
Oh hamburgers!!

294
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,690
Eric! Erihic!

295
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,487
You just left him here?!

296
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:11,046
Without a jacket or anything?!

297
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,364
He told me to!

298
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:13,772
He's dead for sure.

299
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:14,670
Wait!

300
00:18:15,484 --> 00:18:18,172
It's all different.
Nothing's in the same place!

301
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,463
Oh my God...

302
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:22,089
Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!

303
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,571
Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!

304
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:24,589
We have to get out of here!

305
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:25,285
What??

306
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,087
Nobody is ever going to find his body.

307
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,659
You've got to never say anything
about this, do you understand?!

308
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:32,551
He's dead, and if they know you
had a hand in it, you'll go to jail!

309
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,614
But I just did what he told me!

310
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,921
Come on, we have to leave!!

311
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,484
Oh jumping Jesus!

312
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,775
This is terrible. Five
hundred years in the future.

313
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,260
Eric, I have good news for you.

314
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,711
We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.

315
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:57,571
What??

316
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,429
Really?? 

317
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,419
YES!! YES!!

318
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,703
It's rumored that there's one at 

319
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:03,811
the Museum of Technology
at New New Hampshire.

320
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:06,270
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!

321
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,649
Well, there's just...

322
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,987
th-there's something
we need from you first.

323
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:15,995
You see, my young friend, you
were unfrozen for a reason.

324
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:18,489
Lots of people froze
themselves in cryogenic labs

325
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:22,555
and we don't unfreeze them.
But you... are special.

326
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,986
I know I'm special.
This isn't news to me.

327
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:27,784
You lived in a time when
a great event happened.

328
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:31,516
A glorious event that finally
made all religion obsolete.

329
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:35,281
Now, the entire world is atheist.

330
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,413
And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?

331
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,736
We believe that somebody
you knew in your time

332
00:19:42,736 --> 00:19:46,545
was the person who first
started our wonderful group:

333
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:49,211
The Unified Atheist League.

334
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:50,213
Who?

335
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,392
What in Science's name was that?!

336
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:05,076
Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!

337
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,385
Oh Science, help us!

338
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:11,768
Science damn you,
Unified Atheist League!

339
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:12,731
Who are they??

340
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:15,514
The Alliance Atheists.
We're at war with them.

341
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,134
No!

Jesus Christ!

343
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:31,895
Hahahaha, you believe
in a supernatural being.

344
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,621
Oh my Science.

345
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,904
I'm just a little boy from the
