00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:11,170
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

2
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:14,522
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

3
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,859
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

4
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,196
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,340
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

6
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:27,660
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

7
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,842
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

8
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:32,070
<i>Episode 10x10
"Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy"</i>

9
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,485
And so then,
I put my finger up my butthole, right?

10
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,540
And I walked up to Kelly Nelson
and I said, "Do you smell lemon grrass?"

11
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:44,793
And she smelled my finger and puked!
Oh, guys, you should have been there.

12
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,761
Eric, I have to take
you to the principal's office.

13
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,747
What?! I didn't do it.
Kelly Nelson is a lair!

14
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,982
I've been instructed to bring
you to the principals office.

15
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,861
Oh, suck my balls you
ginger Jew rat hall monitor!

16
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,183
Punkass stoolie,
who the fuck do you think you are?!

17
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:00,612
I just doing my job.
- I just dadededeh.

18
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:03,403
You why you are a hallway monitor?
Because you don't have any friends.

19
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,773
You should kill yourself.
You should kill yourself!

20
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:08,822
Eric Cartman, report to the
principals office immediately.

21
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,781
Ah, goddamnit!

22
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,000
Come on in, Eric.

23
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:16,723
I'm sorry, principal Victoria. I didn't
mean to do it, how could I been so foolish.

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,633
Eric, the reason why we called you in here is

25
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:22,110
because it's your turn to
be the school hallway monitor.

26
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:26,132
The hall monitor, me?
- You need to watch for bad behaviour.

27
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:30,242
And make that anyone in the hall
during class has an hall pass, m'okay.

28
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:33,482
If anyone doesn't, you have
the authority to bring them to me.

29
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,190
A... authority?

30
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:41,180
Now Eric, being the school hallway
monitor is a big responsibility, m'okay.

31
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:46,070
It is important you take the job seriously
and that you don't abuse the power.

32
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:47,673
Me?

33
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:53,081
<i>There's fear and darkness all around you

34
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:56,092
<i>The criminals are on the run

35
00:01:56,155 --> 00:02:00,030
<i>No use in not having your hall pass

36
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:03,372
<i>I'll take you to the principal
'cause I'm the Dawg

37
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:07,253
<i>I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg

38
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:10,010
<i>The Hallway Monitor!

39
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:14,941
Hey, kid, get outta there.

40
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,682
That's cool, im done making my video anyways.

41
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,412
Hallpass!
Show me your hallpass!

42
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,770
What?!

43
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:32,900
You know what this is?
This is the mace they use on bears, faggot!

44
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,802
Now let me see your hallpass.
- It's right here.

45
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:38,253
Allright, cool, Rob.
Go with Christ.

46
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:38,981
What?!

47
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:41,012
You can't just push me up against the-

48
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:46,193
I am the dawg.
The big bad.

49
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:48,273
Oh, my god.

50
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:52,422
What the fuck is this?

51
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:57,052
And so this shape with four sides,
is what class?

52
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:02,010
Ike Browlofski.
You littering my hallway brah?

53
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,562
What are you doing?

54
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:07,922
I found this in the hallway.
Apparently your student Ike has an crush on you.

55
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:12,093
You got an crush on your teacher, brah?
Keep it out of my hallway. Go with Christ.

56
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:15,091
Here you go.
- I don't think that's really necessary.

57
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:18,713
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class.
Don't tell me how to run my hallway.

58
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:24,160
Ike has a crush on teacher.
- Ike has a crush on teacher.

59
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,891
That's enough class.

60
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,580
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow everybody.

61
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:34,441
Ike, could you stay just a few minutes please?

62
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,960
Ike, i'm very flattered
by all of your love notes.

63
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:42,513
But I need to be clear.

64
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:45,250
See there's been alot of female teachers
on the news lately.

65
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,743
Who have been having relationships
with young male students and...

66
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,131
people might get the wrong idea.

67
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,002
Even though, I do admire you.

68
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:56,192
You are so smart and gifted.

69
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,621
So mature for your age.

70
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,021
I don't like Mason.

71
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:05,302
You listen and you really care
about what I have to say.

72
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:09,280
You make me feel things,
I never... felt before.

73
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:17,003
Ike, this is crazy.
I'm your teacher.

74
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:20,142
How can we been having
these feelings for eachother?

75
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,222
Your so mysterious.

76
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:25,321
And I can't... And I can't...

77
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:32,490
<i>And  I can't fight this feelin' anymore

78
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:38,631
<i>I've forgotten what I started fightin' for

79
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:43,272
<i>And if I have to crawl upon the floor

80
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>Come crashin' through your door

81
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:54,980
<i>Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore

82
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,330
That was unbelievable.

83
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,562
I've never felt like such a woman before.

84
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:12,622
They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't
let anybody know,they'll never understand.

85
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:17,952
We were ment to be, I know it.
How else can sex be that incredible?

86
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:22,991
Ike, made an nanoo.

87
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:33,081
Hey, there mr weener what ya know.
Do you need to tinkle tinkle?

88
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,983
Yes, I do think so.

89
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,020
Hands! Let me see those hands!

90
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:41,492
Show me your hallpass, brah.
- It's, it's... I just had it.

91
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:42,762
I knew it.

92
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:52,583
Look brah, I had to bring you in. But I don't
have any hard feelings against you, allright?

93
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,722
Huh?
- You need a smoke, brah?

94
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,322
Okay.

95
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,480
You gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
- I do?

96
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,512
Jesus is Lord.

97
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,753
You can one direction in life or you just
walk around in hallways without hallpass.

98
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,360
Or you can see the light, brah.

99
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:14,061
Kyle, I need you to go get your brother
over at his teachers house.

100
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:14,653
Huh?

101
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,330
Tell his teacher i'm sorry, but I forgot
he has an doctors appointment today.

102
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,271
What's he doing at his teachers house?

103
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:23,092
He's been going there in
the afternoons for private turdering

104
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,942
Hello?

105
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,632
Excuse me. I'm here to pickup Ike.

106
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,551
Uh, hallo. Is Ike here?

107
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:45,870
Hallo?

108
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,152
Oh God, i'm sorry. I didn't mean to,
I was looking for my brother.

109
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,562
Ike?

110
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:58,192
What the hell is going on?

111
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:01,340
Oh, what's the use Ike... were caught.

112
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,482
Hold on, please.
You don't understand.

113
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:06,723
Really? What's there not to understand?

114
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,480
Your brother and I...

115
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,961
are in love.

116
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,593
He's a little young, don't you think?

117
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,171
Ike is very mature for his age
and you know it.

118
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,502
He makes me feel like nobody else does.

119
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:25,200
He loves me and only me.
And I know I'm a godness to him.

120
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:28,023
When we make love he can give
it to me hard or soft and gentle-

121
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,000
Allright! We're getting the hell out of here!

122
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:35,453
Ike! You can't possible want this?
We have to tell mom!

123
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:42,101
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?

124
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:44,903
This is nuts.

125
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:53,600
Mom, dad, have you ever
met Ike's kindergarten teacher?

126
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,300
Miss Stevensen?
Yes, she's very nice.

127
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:00,401
Yes, well she likes Ike a whole lot.
- That's great.

128
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,931
Yeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great.

129
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,400
Because to some degree, Ike
and miss Stevensen are having a-

130
00:08:05,408 --> 00:08:06,282
Spider-Man!

131
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,103
Yes, Ike. You like Spider-Man, don't you?

132
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:15,490
Mom, there might be something
that you should look into

133
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,123
about  Ike staying after school all the time-
- Potcan.

134
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,101
Mommy, I love you, I love you.

135
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,403
Mommy, loves you to sweetie.

136
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,200
Would you excuse us for a second.

137
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,223
Mom, I think you should talk
to Ike about love and sex.

138
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,601
Sex?
Oh bubi, Ike is much to young.

139
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:55,602
Your so full of crap, Foley!
- What?

140
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,902
I did shoot him in the face.
Twice!

141
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,202
Ex... excuse me.

142
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,703
My name is... Brad.

143
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,801
And I need to report a crime.
Anonimously.

144
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:07,403
What's the crime?

145
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,951
Well I attend at South Park Elementary.
And... and...

146
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,807
One of the teachers is having sex with a student.

147
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:21,193
You did the right thing telling the police, Brad.
Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?

148
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:23,122
Well, it isn?t a guy teacher, its an woman.

149
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,002
A woman?

150
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,903
Yeah, she's having sex with a boy.

151
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:29,340
Oh, but she's ugly, right?
- No, not really.

152
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,911
It's the kindergarten teacher, miss Stevensen.
- The blonde?

153
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:32,803
Yeah.

154
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,330
Some youg boy is having sex with miss Stevensen?
- Yes.

155
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:38,651
Nice...

156
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:39,722
Nice...

157
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,521
What?!

158
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,993
No, you don't understand it.
- You sure they had sex?

159
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:43,852
Y es.

160
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:46,791
Has she performed oral sex on him?
- I think so.

161
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:49,500
Nice.
- Nice...

162
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:50,802
Niceee...

163
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,900
So wait, what's the crime?

164
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,700
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me.

165
00:09:56,806 --> 00:10:00,002
Hey! He's totally under age!
She's taking advantage of him!

166
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,911
You're right, we're sorry.
This is serious.

167
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,952
We need to track this student down and...

168
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,432
and give him his Luckiest Boy
of America medal right away.

169
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:18,853
Guys, can I talk to you?
- Sure, dude.

170
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:20,682
I need you to keep quiet about this, right?

171
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:22,080
My little brother and his teacher-
- Brah's.

172
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:25,102
It's almost passed time, I need
you to start clear the hallways!

173
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:28,303
Not now, Cartmann.
I have really serious problems!

174
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:29,463
Dude, what's the matter?

175
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:32,001
The kindergarten teacher
is having sex with my brother.

176
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:36,030
Really?

177
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,841
Damn, brah. Your little brother is pretty cool.

178
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:40,683
It's not cool!
Ike isnt old enough to understand.

179
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,013
What's to understand?
You get a boner

180
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,623
slap her titties around some
and stick it inside her and pee.

181
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:49,112
Stick it inside her and pee?

182
00:10:49,786 --> 00:10:51,842
Well, okay fine.
Unless you don't wanna get her pregnant.

183
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,660
Then you pull it out and pee on her leg.

184
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,043
Dude, I really don't see a problem.

185
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,500
Yeah, I got bigger things to deal with.

186
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,281
You guys don't understand!
His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl.

187
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:02,702
They pass notes to eachother in class,
they have sex in her house over lunchbreak.

188
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,100
During class they sneak out
and kiss in the hallways.

189
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:07,753
They what?

190
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:10,420
They sneak out during class
and make out in the hallways.

191
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:13,950
Hang on a second. Making out in
the hallway is strictly against school policy.

192
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:16,312
Well there doing it.
- Well, yeah now it's personal.

193
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,651
The hallways are my juristriction.
If there is an hallway infraction going on...

194
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,572
they are gonna have to deal with the dawg.

195
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:27,782
Okay, just contineu with your macroni pictures.
The teacher has to step out for a second.

196
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:30,803
Ah, Ike. Could you help me out, please?

197
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:36,202
Oh, Ike. I just had to have
an second alone with you.

198
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,313
I like baba better.

199
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:40,890
I got your loveletter
and I wrote you one back.

200
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:44,021
Oh, just one kiss to hold me
over for the rest of the class.

201
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,101
Hall infraction!

202
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,582
Oh ah, we were just heading back in.

203
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:51,032
You got an hallpass, brah?

204
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,302
I dont need an hallpass, I'm a teacher.

205
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,683
Yeah, well were is his hallpass?

206
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:57,190
Look, just let us get back in.
- Get down on the floor!

207
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:58,790
We're going back inside.

208
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,452
You like bear mace, icehead?
- Bear mace?

209
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,510
Your going with Christ!

210
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,452
And thats what I got principal brah.

211
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:11,530
These two were in the hallways, making out.
She had those loveletters on her person.

212
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:14,402
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me?"

213
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:18,302
Miss Stevensen!
Your having an relationship with your student?

214
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:21,323
Yes, during classtime, without an hallpass.

215
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,593
This is unbelievable.
- I know

216
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,813
it's like an hallpass doesnt even matter to her.

217
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:28,893
Miss Stevensen,
I will need to inform the police.

218
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,291
Oh God!

219
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:32,683
You just dealt with the dog, bitch!

220
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,900
Sorry we had to do this,
but the lady principal instisted.

221
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,303
What's going on?

222
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:45,901
The kindergarten teacher is suspected
with having sex with a student.

223
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:47,483
With a student?

224
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,632
But... she's a woman.

225
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:51,320
Yeah, I know.

226
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,723
But... she's hot.

227
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,903
Wow, I think I owe you one, Cartman.

228
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:59,803
You don't owe me anything.
My hallways are clean.

229
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:10,860
Ike, I didn't tell on you.
You got busted by the hallway monitor.

230
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:15,483
Okay, okay,
I did have something to do with it...

231
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:18,301
but someday your gonna
realize it was for the best.

232
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:20,300
You are dead to me.

233
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:22,333
What?

234
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:25,800
I said: Your dead to me.

235
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:28,303
I'm dead to you?

236
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,852
Your dead to me, Kyle!

237
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,930
I'm at the policestation.
They say they found some evidence.

238
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,080
I'm so scared.

239
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:41,350
Listen, I want you to know.
It's okay.

240
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,782
If anybody tries to talk to you,
you don't need to say anything.

241
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,871
Just  leave it to me.

242
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:48,473
I know a way out of this.

243
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:54,503
Tom, an elementary school teacher is
under arrest for an elegently having affair

244
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,303
with one of her young students.

245
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,970
The case is shocking.

246
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:02,030
Due mostly to the fact,
that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom.

247
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:04,750
If the accusations are true, then...

248
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:05,732
damn!

249
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,080
Looks like the defendant and her lawyer
are about to give a statement, Tom.

250
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:14,723
I am deeply sorry to announce that
the allegations against me are true.

251
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:20,801
Over the past several weeks, I have been having
physical relations with one of my students.

252
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,682
Nice.

253
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:24,862
Nice...

254
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,551
I know my actions were wrong,
but I cannot be fully to blame.

255
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:32,521
You see... I am an alcoholic.

256
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:36,680
Yes, I'm afraid its true.

257
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:38,440
Oh no!
- What?

258
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,621
I don't believe it.
She's using the Mel Gibson defense!

259
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,133
I am an perfectly good person.

260
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:49,730
But when I drink, the alcohol makes me say
and do things I normally wouldn't do.

261
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,532
Well, that explains it.

262
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,733
Do we still press charges?
- Who are we gonna convict, Johnny Walker?

263
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:58,223
Poor woman, she's an victim.
- Yeah, she's an hot victim.

264
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:03,643
My client has agreed to check
herself into rehab immediately.

265
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:08,233
Goodluck, ma'am!
You can beat your alcoholism!

266
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:11,403
PARK COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL
REHABILITATION CENTER

267
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:19,773
Alcohol is a crush,
wich we use to medicate ourselfs.

268
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:23,051
to, to cover up emotional bagage from our past.

269
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:26,640
Was there ever an history of sexual
abuse in your family?

270
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:31,652
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my
twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures.

271
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,551
Nice...

272
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,703
Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.

273
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,200
All  better now!

274
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:54,560
Ike!
- Miss Stevensen.

275
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:59,140
Ike, we have to get out of here.
They never let us be together.

276
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:03,722
I think we should go to Milan.
Like we always talked about.

277
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:06,512
Milan...

278
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:09,652
Get your things together!
We don't have much time.

279
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,872
Ike, are you okay?

280
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:18,860
Ike?

281
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:28,101
You sure your not lying, Foley?

282
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,000
No, really! I shot both of them,
they werent even doing nothing!

283
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,403
Help! Please, I need your help!

284
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,372
That teacher, Miss Stevenson,
she, she left town with my son!

285
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,662
I got a note saying they're going to Milan!

286
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,032
You're kidding!
- No, it's true!

287
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:45,273
Damnit, where were all these
sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!

288
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:46,991
This is serious!

289
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful
older woman. Quick! Call the FBI!

290
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:56,720
Are you going to do nothing?!
- All right all right, we'll make a report.

291
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,051
Jesus...

292
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,452
There you are. What are you doing?
You giving up, brah?!

293
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,900
Dude, my brother's in Milan.
There's nothing I can do.

294
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:08,613
No, they haven't left yet.
Their flight is tomorrow morning.

295
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:12,402
How do you know that?
- I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.

296
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,502
Who's Beth?
- Beth is my bitch.

297
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,292
I put a whole crew together, brah.

298
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:19,690
I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut
no matter what it takes! Are you in?!

299
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,910
<i>I got some badass guys to help me.</i>

300
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:29,040
<i>I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.</i>

301
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,962
<i>You think you got away
with not having a hall pass?</i>

302
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,370
<i>You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!</i>

303
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:40,383
<i>I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!</i>

304
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:43,410
<i>Think you can get away with
not having a hall pass? Think again!</i>

305
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:45,901
How was that, Butters?

306
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,002
That was pretty good.

307
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,930
Can we get going now, please?!

308
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,280
Yep. We're all done with
the video, let's move out!

309
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,271
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?

310
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,920
I love TV. Yaaay!

311
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:05,370
But what about me?
I want to talk.

312
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:11,631
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive!
I want her taken down fast and clean!

313
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:15,403
She ran away, now she
got to deal with the Dawg, huh?

314
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:20,200
Beth found out they have a room at
the Airport Hilton. We need to search it.

315
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,541
Here's the hotel!
Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!

316
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,013
All right, let's go! Move out!

317
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:31,520
Hey! You can't leave your car there!
- It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!

318
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,532
Keep separation!
Leeroy, check out our twenty!

319
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,590
Can I help you?
- You seen this woman, brah?

320
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,772
She's staying here!

321
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:42,581
Who are you?
- I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

322
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:45,342
I think you should leave
before I call the police!

323
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,093
Beth! Bear-mace that guy!

324
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:50,592
Let's check out the rooms!
Leeroy and Kyle go that way!

325
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,800
Beth, you come with me!

326
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,250
We need police here, right away!

327
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,140
Y es?

328
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:00,233
I'm looking for this teacher!
Is she in your room, brah?!

329
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:03,521
Do you mind keepin' it down?
- Keep your mouth shut, brah!

330
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:10,291
Oh no! Ike!
They're on to us!

331
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,080
Oh no!

332
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:14,590
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!

333
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:16,621
What have we got? What have we got?!
- Who called 911?!

334
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:17,923
They went that way.

335
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,791
Look out! They have bear mace!

336
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:23,903
Open up!
I'm with the Dawg!

337
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:25,442
Oh crap!

338
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:27,173
You freeze right there!

339
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,352
Come on, darling!

340
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:32,953
Hey!

341
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:36,501
Mam ich Dawg!
Pi¹te piêtro!

342
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,030
Praise Christ! Let's go!

343
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,501
Ike, run!

344
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,170
Beth!
Bear mace that guy! And that guy!

345
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:52,893
Freeze, bitch!
- Freeze!

346
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,632
Hands up! Hands up!
- Don't move! Don't move!

347
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,422
It's all right!
There's been a misunderstanding!

348
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:58,901
I'm a hall monitor.

349
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:03,613
This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway
infraction by skipping off to Milan.

350
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:07,080
Hey, that is the teacher we
just got the report about.

351
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,783
All right, Miss Stevenson,
you got nowhere to go!

352
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:13,683
Why couldn't you just leave us alone?
All we wanted was to love.

353
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,800
Get down! We can do this the easy way,
or we can do it Dawg-style!

354
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:20,900
She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?

355
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:22,753
It's all over, Ike.

356
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:27,253
Milan, the house in Tuscany.
They'll never let us be together!

357
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:29,401
We have to go with the backup plan.

358
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:36,923
Now hold on, don't do anything foolish!
We can talk about this!

359
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:42,911
You can't accept our love?
So then we can only be together in eternity.

360
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:45,213
No!
Ike, don't do it!

361
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,831
I don deser futty bad man.

362
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:53,272
Ike, please. I know your first love seems
like the only love, but trust me, it's not.

363
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,572
You have so much life ahead of you.

364
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,443
You who don't believe i
true love don't understand.

365
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,571
Ike, you need to have a life.

366
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:06,220
Have fun.
Then ruin it by having a serious relationship.

367
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,982
I'm afraid you're too late.

368
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,900
Are you ready, my love?
Here we go!

369
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:16,061
One, two, three, aaaahhh!

370
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,262
Ike?

371
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,680
Yaaaay!

372
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,183
Ike!

373
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,190
Well, looks like once again,
the Dawg has prevailed.

374
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,141
I hope you've learned, kids,
that if you don't go with Christ

375
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,811
you could end up just like that
splattered bitch down on the pavement.

376
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,163
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.

377
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,890
That's cool.
I'm done making my video anyways.
