I'm goin out to south park

00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:16,480
Ample parking day or night

I'm heading out to south park

6
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:22,945

really big fat titties

So come on out to south park

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,520
Episode 10x06
"ManBearPig"

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,800
M'kay, students, we have a very
special guest speaker today.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,200
Who can tell me the name of
our country's last vice-president?

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Dick Cheney?

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,403
No, the last one.

13
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:42,800
Bill Clinton.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,900
No, Clinton's vice-president.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,500
He is here today to talk to you students
about some very serious issues.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,804
Please welcome Al Gore.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,204
Who?

18
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:02,701
Thank you, Mr. Mackey,
students of South Park Elementary.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,900
I'm here to educate you about
the single biggest threat to our planet.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
You see...

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,600
there is something out there
which threatens our very existence

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,000
and may be the end of
the human race as we know it.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,800
I'm talking of course about...
Manbearpig.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,900
Manbearpig?

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
It is a creature which roams the earth alone.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,800
It is half man, half bear
and half pig.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Some people say that Manbearpig isn't real.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,500
Well, I'm here to tell you know,
Manbearpig is very real

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,100
and he most certainly exists.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm serial.

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,800
Manbearpig doesn't care who
you are or what you've done.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Manbearpig simply wants to get you!

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,900
I'm super-serial.

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
But have no fear,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,900
because I am here to save you!

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,700
And someday,
when the world is rid of Manbearpig,

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,100
everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore".

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
"You're super awesome".

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
The end.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,900
Thank you, class.

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Excelsior!

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Check out this sweet move.

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
Kyle, you can't block like that.

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,300
Just play the game, fatass!

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,700
Pass it to me, Cartman!

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Hang on.
I'm going to do something super killer.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,100
God damnit, stop it, Kyle!

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,300
All right, check it out.
This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do.

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,500
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole!
It's getting late!

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Let's just see who gets
the ball this time, Jewboy!

52
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,500
Kyle, knock it off!

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!

54
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Foood!

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't worry, it's not really manbearpig.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,900
It's me, Al Gore.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,900
We know.

58
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,900
Dude, what are you doing?

59
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm spreading manbearpig awareness.

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet
and a bumper sticker.

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
<i>"We must all stop ManBearPig"</i>

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,700
I hope now you boys see
that this is totally serial.

63
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,400
The next time,
it could be the "real" manbearpig.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet?

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,400
Just your name and phone number

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
and where you first heard about manbearpig?

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Uhh, Stan?
- Oh, hey Dad.

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Hello.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,050
It's ah...
getting late, boys.

70
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,400
Why don't you get in the car
and I'll drive you all home?

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay, Mr. Marsh.

72
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,800
Be safe.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,100
Boys, I don't want you hanging out
with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?

74
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,300
Aw, he's all right, Dad.

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.

76
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,400
ManBearPig?

77
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,000
He's half man and half bearpig.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,300
No, dude, he's half man
and half bear and half pig.

79
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,700
That doesn't make any sense.

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,400
He could be half bear, half manpig.

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,300
Boys, there's no such thing as a manbearpig.

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,100
The vice president is just
desperate for attention.

83
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad.
I don't think he has any friends.

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,400
Hello?
- Hello, this is Al Gore

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh man...
Hi Mr. Gore.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,300
I was the vice president.
- I know.

87
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you and your friends make it to an
emergency manbearpig meeting tomorrow morning?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
I have some evidence
he could be in this area.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,300
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,500
Oh. I get it.

91
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,300
You don't believe me either.

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,200
No, no, it's not that.
- Yes it is.

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,100
Nobody believes me!

94
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm trying to warn everybody
and nobody takes me serial!

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,600
I just want somebody in the world
to take me serial just for once.

96
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,300
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
- No, you don't.

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs
to be stopped. I'm just...

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,100
I'm just scared that I can't
do anything to stop him.

99
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Are you serial?

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes, I'm serial.

101
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Don't worry!
We can stop him!

102
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,400
Bring everyone you can to my manbearpig
meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp!

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
Dude, why are we going
to hang out with this guy?

104
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,900
Yeah, I don't get it.

105
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,100
Come on, you guys,
Al Gore doesn't have any friends.

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,600
We'll just make an appearance at
his little meeting and then we'll go.

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Hi kids! Come on in!

108
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, let's get this meeting started.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,400
What do you kids think we
should do to stop ManBearPig?

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore,

111
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
uh, my dad's a geologist,

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,200
and he said that ManBearPig
probably isn't in Colorado.

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,900
What does your dad look like?

114
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,200
Does he have large hooves
where his feet should be?

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
No!

116
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
Damn. For a minute there,
I thought we found him.

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Well, this was a great meeting.
Wasn't it, guys?

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
But, we gotta get goin' to school now.

119
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Oh my God!

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
ManBearPig screen active!

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
What is this area of Colorado!
It's a it's a cave of some kind!

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds.
It's a tourist attraction.

123
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Oh Jesus on ice skates,
we've gotta get down there right away.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Ah I don't think so, dude.

125
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,900
Yeah, we've got school anyway.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can get you all excused from school.

127
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,100
You... have that kind of power?

128
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,200
Look!
You boys have a chance to help me find

129
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,900
and kill ManBearPig once and for all!

130
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm totally serial!

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,800
Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds.

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,100
Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers

133
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,500
in one of the most elaborate
cavern systems in Colorado.

134
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,500
Before we get started I do understand
we have a special guest in our group today.

135
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,200
The ex vice-president, Mr. Al Gore.

136
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Mr. Gore asked me to make sure
you all knew he was here.

137
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Now, once we enter the cave we do
ask you that you follow two rules:

138
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,400
stay on the path and do not touch anything.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Allright, are we ready?

140
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah.

141
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,500
Let's go cavin'.

142
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,500
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave.

143
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,700
It was discovered in 1892

144
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,000
and first used as a hideout
for smugglers of the Old West.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,203
Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur

146
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:51,207
or a salmon-like odor coming
from the caves lately?

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
No.

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Now, as you can see, the cave is filled
with stalagmites and stalagtites.

149
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,600
Water drips from the cave's...
- All right, kids.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I need you to keep an eye out
for manbearpig droppings.

151
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
What do manbearpig droppings look like?

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,000
Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.

153
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,400
These rocks often make interesting
shapes which we like to name.

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,700
For instance, this one here we named
"The Hanging Mushroom".

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,200
And over here we have
"Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls".

156
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,900
And finally, of course,
the "Two Sisters".

157
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,100
Now the cave itself is millions of years old
and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.

158
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Groan! Groan!

159
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?

160
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Not yet.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,500
All right, everyone, if you'll step this way,
you'll see how the cave gets its name.

162
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Kids!

163
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
Kids, over here!
Look.

164
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,200
What?
- I bet this is where he's hiding.

165
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
This looks like ManBearPig Central.

166
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Come on!

167
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,300
Come on! This is where ManBearPig is!
I'm serial!

168
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,200
In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually
blows through, causing a sound you can hear.

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Take a picture of the sound, Steven.

170
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
Mr. Gore, I I think we should
stay with the tour group.

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,300
Wait! Shhh.

172
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,600
Christ!
He's here!

173
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,400
Take this rope!
Be ready to tie him up!

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've got you now, you son of a bitch!

175
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,200
What are you doing?!

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh no!

177
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
No!

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,900
Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!

179
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Help!

180
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!

181
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,700
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave.
Now!

182
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Hello?
- Help!

183
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,800
We're trapped in here!
- Somebody get us some help down hyah!

184
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
Hello, help!
- Hello?

185
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,600
Forget it!
They can't hear us!

186
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,900
What are we gonna do?

187
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,800
You'd better get us out of here, asshole!

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,500
Me?

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,200
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore!

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,700
Now we're trapped in a cave!

191
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,300
Maybe there's another way out of here.

192
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh, no kidding.

193
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
All right, let's split up
and look for a passageway.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,300
Everyone take a different direction.

195
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh man, we're in big trouble here.

196
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
This is... bullcrap!

197
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,100
If I'ma thin I'm gonna be so... pissed off!

198
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Goddamnit!

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,900
"Smugglers Den"

200
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
You see anything, Kenny?

201
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
No, nothing!

202
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Cartman?

203
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,700
Cartman, you see anything?

204
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,300
No, nothing...

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
No, nothing here!

206
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
Nothing this way!

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,300
"Smugglers Den"

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Tr... treasure.

209
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
Cartman, you okay?

210
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,500
You need help?
- I'm fine!

211
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,000
This way is just a... dead end!
Coming back to you now!

212
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,200
It looks like we're completely sealed in.

213
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Yes, I see that.

214
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
There's a small passageway about
200 yards over there, but...

215
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
it goes for a long long way
and it's pretty steep.

216
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
Maybe we should go for it.

217
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,300
You guys go on ahead.
I'm gonna stay here, wait it out.

218
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Why?
- I just... I don't feel very good.

219
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,900
I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.

220
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Cartman's right.

221
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,800
First rule of survival is stay put
and wait to be rescued.

222
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
No, it's okay.
You guys go on ahead.

223
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
No, we'll stay here too.

224
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,800
If we start wandering off,
we're gonna get lost or killed.

225
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,100
Let's just wait here
and hope help comes soon.

226
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,800
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't
go over there if I were you guys.

227
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,300
I just took a huge dump.

228
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,900
Aw, dude!

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,700
The cave-in was massive.

230
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,200
It has cut off all access in or out.

231
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
The children are believe to be
trapped somewhere in this area.

232
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,800
Does anybody know who these kids are?

233
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
No, nobody seems to knew them.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
Only that they were in the tour group.

235
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,000
Digging to them is going to take days.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,100
Excuse me, Excuse me.

237
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
This cave-in was no accident

238
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,200
and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast!

239
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I am super... duper... serial!

240
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,500
What do you mean?
The cave-in is over.

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm afraid you have a much bigger
problem than a cave-in.

242
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
What's that?

243
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What is that, a pigbearman?

244
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
No, stupid!
It's ManBearPig!

245
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm sooo hungry.

246
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you think people even know we're here?

247
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,700
They saw us on the tour.

248
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,900
Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,500
just... n-need to keep taking a crap.

250
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,000
I got diarrhea, really bad.

251
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,100
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here
without you taking a crap every ten minutes!

252
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Let's just try to sleep.
Maybe help will come tomorrow.

253
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
All that treasure.

254
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
It's all mine!

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
So long as these greedy assholes
don't find out about it!

256
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,600
You would all just looove to get your
hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?!

257
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Even though I found it, you'd love
to think it's somehow yours, too!

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
God, I hate you guys!

259
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,600
Especially you...

260
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,700
you money-grubbing snake in the grass!

261
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Well I have news for you, Kyle!

262
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,000
You're never going to get my treasure.

263
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,900
I've got a little plan going, to get the
treasure out of here without you ever knowing.

264
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,300
C-Cartman ?

265
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?

266
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Dude, what are you doing?

267
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Not much.

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know, just hangin' out.

269
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
How've you been, man? Good?

270
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Dude, get away from me!

271
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle.
See you around.

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,600
Why won't anybody listen to me?!

273
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,100
ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill
him while we all have the chance.

274
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm serial!

275
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down.

276
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
Now, what exactly do you suggest we do?

277
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
I told you we need to fill
the cave with hot molten lead,

278
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
'cause it's the only way to make
sure ManBearPig never comes out!

279
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,300
And I'm sane and I'm totally serial,
but everyone just keeps digging!

280
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,300
Well, see, the problen is that if we
fill the caves with hot molten lead,

281
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,800
it will kill those boys too.

282
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,400
They're already dead!
Didn't you listen to me?

283
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,500
They got attacked by a manbearpig
and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive!

284
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm super serial!

285
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,500
Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial!

286
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Do you want me to get
the ex vice-president out of here?

287
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,100
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him.

288
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
I don't think he has any friends.

289
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,000
All right. Gotta be strong.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,700
There's still a lot more treasure to go.

291
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
Dude, he's really sick.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,600
It's been three days since four unidentified
children were trapped in a cave-in.

293
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Three days without food
and time is certainly running out.

294
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
The digging continues,
but progress is fatally slow.

295
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,000
All right, people, we've gotta work faster!

296
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,300
Our best estimate still puts us three days

297
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,900
from reaching the area of the cave
called "Smuggler's Den".

298
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,000
Smuggler's Den?

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
It's a room near the end of the tour

300
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,300
where you can get your picture
taken with fake treasure.

301
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,400
Here, see?

302
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,600
Based on where the boys were seen last,

303
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
they're somewhere near this area!

304
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Hopefully they've followed the first
rule of survival and stayed put.

305
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Stan! Stan, wake up!

306
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,500
Huh? What? Have they come for us?

307
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
No, it's Cartman.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Something's really wrong with him.

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh my God.

310
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?

311
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I'm fahn.

312
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Just a lit-

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
No big deal... Beh.

314
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,200
We can't wait here any longer!

315
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Dude, we've gotta get him out
of here or he's gonna die.

316
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,100
How, dude?

317
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,200
We don't even know if that passage
I found goes anywhere.

318
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Maybe we should get out first.

319
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,300
See if we can find a way out
and then come back for him.

320
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
No dont!

321
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Don't leave me here, you assholes.
Don't leave me here to die.

322
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Come on come on!
Pull!

323
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,300
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!

324
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Buh. Hurry you guys.
You gotta get me out of here.

325
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
What the hell is that?
- Cartman?

326
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
You guys, we've got no time!
You gotta get me out!

327
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,900
This is the end of you, ManBearPig.

328
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,300
Excelsior!

329
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
We're almost there!

330
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,100
I can't keep carrying him, dude!
I've got no strength!

331
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,500
Yes you do!

332
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,200
What the hell is that?

333
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Oh my God.

334
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
No! Let me out of here!

335
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,200
Let me out of here, you guys!

336
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Ruuun!

337
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
That's it! Pull everyone out!
There's nothing more we can do!

338
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
You're calling off the rescue?

339
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,400
We didn't plan on a freak river flood.

340
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,700
God must really want those kids dead.

341
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,200
Well what if the children aren't dead?

342
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Look, the cavern is completely flooded.

343
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
Nothing could have survived.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There's nothing left alive down there.

345
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,400
Nothing left alive...

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
I did it.

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
I killed ManBearPig.

348
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,200
I've saved the earth from certain destruction.

349
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,900
Everyone is super-stoked on me,
even if they don't know it.

350
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Kenny! Here, take my hand!

351
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,300
Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!

352
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Grab my hand.

353
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Cartman! You've gotta swim!

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,700
Kick with your legs!

355
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,400
I can't kick!
- Yes you can!

356
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
I can't!
Kick yourself back to safety!

357
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
I need your help!
- No, you just have to save me.

358
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,100
Kyle, no!

359
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
We are gathered here to say goodbye

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,900
to four kids whom we all tried to help

361
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
but, in the end, could not.

362
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,500
But where there is loss, there is hope.

363
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,900
For ManBearPig is no more.

364
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh Jesus, here we go again.

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
I have beaten ManBearPig

366
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,900
and we will never forget the names
of the brave young kids who lost their lives.

367
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Kid 1

368
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
Kid 2

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Kid 3

370
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,200
and of course

371
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
Kid 4.

372
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.

373
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
And how Kid 2 was always
there when I needed him.

374
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,200
Oh my God!

375
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
<i>Kid 4 was filled with hope</i>

376
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,900
It's the kids!
- They're alive!

377
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
Kids!
I saved you!

378
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,400
Stay away from us, asshole!

379
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,900
I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you

380
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
because you don't have any friends!

381
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
But now I see why you don't have any friends!

382
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,700
You just used ManBearPig as
a way to get attention for yourself

383
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,100
because you're a LOSER!

384
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,400
Hyeah right.

385
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,700
The man who singlehandedly
killed ManBearPig is a loser.

386
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,100
We need to get our friend
to a hospital right away!

387
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
No!
No, I'm fine!

388
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I just need to get home and rest.

389
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,100
No! I just need to get to a toilet.

391
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
See you guys. I...

392
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,500
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?

393
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,500
It's mine!
It's mine, you hear me?!

394
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I got it out of the cave,
it belongs to me!

395
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,900
Keep your greedy hands away!

396
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,900
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure
from our Smuggler's Den photo room.

397
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,200
That's right
and I...

398
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Fake treasure?

399
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah, we put it there for kids
to take their picture with.

400
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,700
All in all, I'd say that treasure
is worth about fourteen dollars.

401
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
No, nooo!

402
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,500
You made us pull you to safety
because you ate treasure?!

403
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,600
You son of a bitch!

404
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,300
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?!

405
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, my work here is done.

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,700
I've killed MBP

407
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
and now I must save
the world from something else.

408
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,900
Maybe I'll make a movie.

409
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
A movie starring me.

410
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Then people will take me super serial.

411
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,500
Excelsior!
