00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:36,696
<i>Welcome to the televised broadcast</i>

4
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:40,181
<i>of the olympic opening
ceremonies from Beijing!</i>

5
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,981
<i>Thousands of Chinese performers
play ancient Chinese drums.</i>

6
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,643
<i>The precision of their movements
made even more impressive</i>

7
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:52,575
<i>by their massive numbers.</i>

8
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,777
The Chinese, no!
Somebody has to stop them!

9
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,080
Sweetie, are you having nightmares
about the Chinese again?

10
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:19,588
They're gonna take over the world!

11
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:25,202
<i>Too many of them.</i>

12
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:27,999
Leave us alone!

13
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,289
Sweetiekins, are you all right?

14
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,771
Mom, the Chinese
are gonna get me!

15
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,040
No, sweetie, the Chinese
aren't going to get you.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,419
They are so!
There's 2 billion of them

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,389
and their economy is getting better
and with their advances in technology

18
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,222
they're going to bring down America

19
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:02,030
All right.
Guys, we need to talk.

20
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,796
We can all just pretend that we
didn't see those opening ceremonies,

21
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:09,192
but the Chinese are very real.

22
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,797
We gotta do something.

23
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:14,601
Are we just going to pretend
America is going to be okay?

24
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,431
Are we just gonna wait
until they've taken over the world?

25
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:22,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I'm not doing this.

26
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,963
Kyle, you're supposed to tell
Cartman he's being racist or something.

27
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,819
Yeah, he's an idiot, but I'm sorry.
I just, I can't do this anymore. Okay?

28
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,515
I can't do this anymore.

29
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:47,288
You can't keep doing this.

30
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:50,539
You know at some point
you've got to let this go.

31
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:56,014
Maybe you can forget
what happened, but I can't.

32
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,421
Look, what happened, happened.
We can't change it now.

33
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,269
- We all have to move on.
- Move on?

34
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,562
Our friend was raped, Stan.

35
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:08,619
He was raped and we all
stood there and did nothing.

36
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,912
There was nothing
we could do, Kyle.

37
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:12,693
There was nothing we could do.

38
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,352
We had to get out of there.

39
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,501
Did we?

40
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:19,534
- Maybe we could have stopped them.
- How?

41
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,649
I dream about it every night.

42
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:28,142
Every time I close my eyes
I see us just running away.

43
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:32,298
Running while they rape him
over and over again.

44
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,262
And because we did nothing,
they got away.

45
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,516
You can't keep torturing yourself
like this, Kyle. Let it go.

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,937
I'm glad that you guys
can just keep living.

47
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,730
I don't think I can.

48
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,084
Goddammit.

49
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,215
I got some splish-splash.

50
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,084
Splish-splashy more.

51
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,053
- There you are, Butters!
- Eric?

52
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,846
- Butters, I need your help.
- Not now. I'm indecent!

53
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,024
The Chinese are going
to take us over!

54
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,396
And we are the only people
who seem to care.

55
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:08,694
The Chinese?

56
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:11,030
I handed out flyers for meetings,
but it's like

57
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,750
everyone's blind.

58
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,171
The Chinese are taking over the world
and nobody's doing anything.

59
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,523
It's up to you and me. We have
to stop the Chinese. Now!

60
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:23,283
I can't stop them tonight, I'm supposed
to make a model car with my dad.

61
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:26,160
You don't get it, Butters!
Our lives are about to change!

62
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,416
The Chinese outnumber us
a million to one.

63
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,992
And when their army gets here,
they're gonna kill your parents.

64
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:34,809
- Why are they gonna kill my parents?
- Because the Chinese hate Americans.

65
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,934
That's why I've started
the American Liberation Front.

66
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:41,232
A group dedicated to freeing
America from Chinese tyranny.

67
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:44,662
- Will you join me?
- I don't want my parents to die.

68
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,190
So you'll join
the American Liberation Front?

69
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,179
- Well, sure!
- You and me,

70
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,839
we're going to be the brave little boys
who fought back.

71
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,315
We are not letting them
take over our country.

72
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:55,766
The Chinese.

73
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,431
Yeah, fuck'em!

74
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,242
<i>No. We have to stop them.</i>

75
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:09,274
<i>They're raping him.
Rape!</i>

76
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,399
<i>- Let's get out of here!
- We can't just leave!</i>

77
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,611
<i>- Come on!
- It's horrible!</i>

78
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:17,695
<i>- Oh, God!
- Somebody do something!</i>

79
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:19,611
<i>Why are they doing this?</i>

80
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,009
<i>They're just taking Indiana Jones
and they're, they're raping him!</i>

81
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,481
<i>I can't watch!
Let's get out of here, Kyle!</i>

82
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,768
<i>Why would Spielberg
and Lucas do this?</i>

83
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,229
<i>Come on.
Let's go!</i>

84
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,210
<i>- Why are they doing this?
- Just run!</i>

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,606
<i>Oh, God, what have they done?</i>

86
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:39,050
<i>Why aliens? Aliens don't belong
in an Indiana Jones movie!</i>

87
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:44,472
<i>- Come on, there's nothing we can do!
- Why? Why?</i>

88
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:47,976
<i>- We can't help him now.
- I thought it was pretty good!</i>

89
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:50,520
<i>Let's just go!
Let's just go!</i>

90
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,344
All right, Butters.
We're here.

91
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,998
- Are you ready?
- I'm scared.

92
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:07,737
But I know my country needs me.

93
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:10,114
This is it, Butters.
We have to be strong.

94
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:13,339
We're taking down
those goddamn Chinese right now.

95
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:19,213
Things could get ugly in there.

96
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,759
We've got to infiltrate and find out
the Chinese invasion plans.

97
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,004
But, Eric, why would the Chinese
tell us their invasion plans?

98
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:27,480
Because we're going to make them
think we're one of them.

99
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,506
Here, put these teeth in.
And just say "harro" and "prease" a lot.

100
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,272
Oh, harro prease!
Bing bao ching chong!

101
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:37,008
Bing bing harro prease.

102
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,780
Welcome to P.F. Chang's.
I'll be right with you.

103
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,433
Eric, those peaparu
aren't Chinese.

104
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:50,026
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- What?

105
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:53,466
It's already started.
White people working for the Chinese.

106
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,718
- Starving at their own country.
- Can I Help you?

107
00:06:56,838 --> 00:07:00,325
Oh, yes. Harro prease.
We're Chinese people.

108
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:03,141
Harro prease,
Bing bao ching chong!

109
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,691
Yeah, well. Why don't
I seat you over here.

110
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:10,021
- Your waitress will be right with you.
- Ping po ching cho.

111
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,717
What the hell is going on here?

112
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:14,430
We've got to sneak our way
into the back. There they are!

113
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,482
Chinese people. There's
Chinese people right over there.

114
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:23,696
You see them?

115
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,833
My God. The Chinese are here.
Okay, I'm freaked out.

116
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:28,451
- I'm freaking out.
- Stay calm.

117
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:32,046
They're right there and they're gonna
scream and bang on those drums and...

118
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,344
Thank you, Butters.
All right.

119
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:37,960
We need to go over there and find out
what we can from those {\commie }rats.

120
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:41,589
- Harro prease. Harro.
- Harro, prease.

121
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:44,258
So nice to see
other Chinese peaparu.

122
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,512
As you can see,
we are Chinese peoparu ourselves.

123
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:51,307
Bing bong bing bong.
Ching cho fing fong.

124
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,358
{\What are they doing?}

125
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:54,809
{\I don't know.}

126
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:58,190
Yes! Bing bong bing bong!

127
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,591
So what are the plans
to take over America again?

128
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,753
I forgot.

129
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,799
I don't know what to do about Kyle.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,944
You know, I don't think
he's ever going to be the same.

131
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:23,172
And what about you, Stan?
We were all in the theater that day.

132
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,822
We all saw it happen.

133
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:29,082
Well, I just try
not to think about it.

134
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,878
I thought I could go on like before.

135
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,157
But after seeing
Indiana get raped...

136
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:38,521
After seeing Indiana get raped,
I know that I'll never be the same.

137
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:45,873
Do you remember the scene
with Indiana in the refrigerator?

138
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:48,803
It didn't make any sense, Stan.

139
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:54,138
I don't need this now. I just want
things to be the way they were!

140
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,040
You can't run from it forever, Stan!

141
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,800
Sooner or later,

142
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,395
we all have to face what we saw.

143
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,764
<i>Indiana Jones, all right!</i>

144
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:18,060
<i>Hey there, Stan!
All set to see my new adventure?</i>

145
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,009
<i>You bet, Indiana!</i>

146
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:26,110
<i>Look out, Indy!
It's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!</i>

147
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:29,418
<i>Well, well, hello there, Indiana.</i>

148
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,590
<i>You're looking good.</i>

149
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,521
<i>What are you doing to do to him?</i>

150
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,404
<i>Yeah, get his pants down.
Get his pants down.</i>

151
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,060
<i>Hold him, Lucas.
Come on.</i>

152
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,431
<i>He ain't going nowhere!</i>

153
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,797
<i>Stop! Rape!</i>

154
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,789
All right, Butters. I think we almost
got the Chinese to trust us.

155
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,109
Now as soon as they tell us
their invasion plan,

156
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:13,034
make a run for that door, okay?

157
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:17,578
That's a good one, pig ling.

158
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:20,414
So where were we?
Oh, yes, the invasion pwan!

159
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,864
Invasion pwan!

160
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:26,128
What day is American invasion again?
I forget!

161
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:27,752
Excuse me, miss?

162
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:28,930
Yes, sir?

163
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,800
These people won't leave us alone.

164
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:35,304
No, no! It's okay.
We are Chinese perparu.

165
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,445
You aren't Chinese.

166
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:42,441
- Oh, my god!
- We're busted! What do we do?

167
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,391
- Okay, why don't we go...
- Stay back!

168
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:48,693
Nobody moves, you got that?
Don't touch us!

169
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,608
We know what the Chinese are up to.

170
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:53,864
We saw the Olympic opening ceremonies!
The gig is up!

171
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,965
Everyone just step over
to that wall. I mean it!

172
00:10:57,297 --> 00:10:59,405
- Butters, hold this gun on them.
- A gun?

173
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,974
- Hold the gun on them!
- I don't want a gun!

174
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,343
They're taking over our country!
This is life or death now! Help me!

175
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,377
Oh, jeez!

176
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,505
Everyone get up and get over
to that wall! Do it! Move!

177
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:14,924
We are the American Liberation Front!

178
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:16,635
And you are all going to pay

179
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,115
for betraying your country
to the Chinese.

180
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,144
This is stupid.
I'm leaving.

181
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:25,021
You go anywhere
until the police arrive!

182
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,314
Screw you.

183
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,134
- Shoot him, Butters!
- No!

184
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,468
You have to shoot him.

185
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,361
He's gonna warn the Chinese
and they'll kill your parents! Do it!

186
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,867
Oh, dude, you shot him in the dick.

187
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:44,858
That's not cool, Butters.
You don't shoot a guy in the dick.

188
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,273
- I tried to stop him and you said...
- It doesn't matter.

189
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:50,464
You never shoot a guy in the dick.

190
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,170
Everyone knows that.

191
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,892
Shooting a guy in the dick?

192
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:55,900
That's just... That's just weak.

193
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,721
I can't believe you, Butters.

194
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:00,431
{\PARK COUNTY}
{\DISTRICT ATTORNEY}

195
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,406
my name is Kyle broflovski.

196
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,935
My friend was raped
last Memorial Day weekend.

197
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
And I...

198
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,023
I want to help prosecute
the men responsible.

199
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,908
You want to bring
Spielberg and Lucas

200
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,180
to trial for raping Indiana Jones?

201
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,647
I know that I'll have to testify.

202
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,510
That I'll have to relive
what I saw that day.

203
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,120
But I can't let Spielberg
and Lucas get away with it.

204
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,253
Not this time.

205
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:27,493
Even if I have to do it alone.

206
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,560
You aren't alone.

207
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,083
We'll all testify.

208
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:35,012
We can't let them
ever do this again.

209
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,124
- I love you.
- I love you too, Stan.

210
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:48,729
Kids, kids. I'm sorry,
but this is ridiculous.

211
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,302
- Why?
- You don't have a case here.

212
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:56,791
You can't really say that they
raped Indiana Jones in the new film.

213
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,680
- Did you see it?
- Yes, I saw it, but I...

214
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,987
but I just try
not to think about it.

215
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:07,099
Then you saw what Lucas
and Spielberg did to him!

216
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,829
I don't know what I saw!

217
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,549
All right, I mean,
it was dark in the theater.

218
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:14,893
I mean, maybe things got
a little out of hand with the plot,

219
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,906
- but the third act clipped along...
- Indy deserved more than that!

220
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:19,233
Get out!

221
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:20,970
Just get the hell out of here!

222
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,919
<i>Well, well, Indiana Jones.
You're looking nice.</i>

223
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,525
<i>There you go, Lucas.
Stick 'em.</i>

224
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:50,504
<i>He's gonna do it right there.</i>

225
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,793
<i>All right.
All right, Georgie!</i>

226
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,313
<i>Grab his hands.</i>

227
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,883
<i>Hey, leave him alone!</i>

228
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,176
<i>Come on, big guy.</i>

229
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:15,174
Wait.

230
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,145
Wait.

231
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,850
I want to help!

232
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:32,196
Look, we don't know
what you're talking about.

233
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,710
There is no Chinese plan
to take over America.

234
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,864
Shut up!

235
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:38,864
These American traitors might have
bought your propaganda, but not us!

236
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,010
Oh, thank God.
The police are here! We're safe!

237
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,724
<i>You with the gun, step out
or we will fire upon you.</i>

238
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,978
You got it wrong. We aren't
with the Chinese. We're the good guys...

239
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,622
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

240
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:03,302
- What?
- One of the cops is Chinese!

241
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:05,484
Son of a bitch,
how high up does this thing go?

242
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,409
We can't trust anybody here!

243
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,881
Don't come any closer!
We have information

244
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,999
that we will only trust
with the President of the United States!

245
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,003
- The President?
- Come on men, we're going in!

246
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:22,091
Goddammit, we're serious.
We only talk to the President. Stop!

247
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,124
Fire, warning shot, Butters.

248
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,780
Dude, what the f*** are you doing?

249
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,224
What? What happened?

250
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:36,647
Goddammit, what did I say
about shooting guys in the dick?

251
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,773
- I did it again.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

252
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,945
That's not cool, Butters.
That's not cool.

253
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:47,011
You don't fuckin' do that.

254
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:51,826
- You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

255
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,542
It's not okay.
Defeating Chinese won't be anything

256
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:58,352
if you do it by going around,
shooting people in the dick.

257
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,155
God... dammit.

258
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:06,927
It's all right there in front of you,
detective.

259
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,928
Five sworn statements from these...

260
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,599
brave boys. It's now up to you.

261
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,222
Are you nuts?

262
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:17,187
I'm not going out and arresting
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!

263
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,441
- But they raped Indiana Jones!
- I know it's hard to think about.

264
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,777
But you have to be strong.
Remember how that movie made you feel.

265
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,394
I didn't see it!

266
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:30,301
- You didn't see the new Indiana Jones{\movie}?
- No!

267
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,495
I didn't think anybody here saw it!
Did you, Mitch?

268
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,717
What you doing
in our neck of the woods?

269
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:49,386
Now let's you just drop them pants.

270
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,348
- Drop?
- Just take 'em right off.

271
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:56,520
- What do you guys want?
- Don't say anything. Just do it.

272
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:04,047
Pull off that little ol' bitty...
shirt there, too.

273
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,448
Them panties, take 'em off.

274
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:19,826
There boy.

275
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,316
I bet you can squeal.

276
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:24,332
I bet you can squeal like a pig.

277
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:26,654
Go ahead, squeal.
Squeal now.

278
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:28,073
Squeal.

279
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:29,862
Squeal.

280
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,292
Squeal louder!

281
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:32,794
Louder!

282
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,391
Louder. Get down there, boy.

283
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:40,848
There, get them britches down.
Yes, sir. Come on, squeal.

284
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:53,998
It's okay.

285
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,389
You don't have
to feel alone anymore.

286
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:05,690
No, you listen to me!

287
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,480
I have Chinese attackers here
and Chinese supporters.

288
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,582
If I go outside, there are more Chinese
ready to take me down.

289
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:15,207
Defending America is all that matters,
Mr. President, I will stop at nothing.

290
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,006
Do you understand that I...

291
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,214
- What happened?
- They...

292
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,959
tried to come in through the roof.
They were gonna take the gun!

293
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,436
Good. Did you kill 'em?

294
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:28,111
Not exactly.

295
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:32,235
Oh, it stings.

296
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,451
It's not where I aimed, honest!

297
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,755
Dude.

298
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,559
I seriously didn't mean it!

299
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:42,815
Dude.

300
00:18:43,693 --> 00:18:45,743
You know what, Butters?
You know what?

301
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:46,863
Forget it.

302
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:48,922
Where you going?

303
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:51,007
You can deal with the Chinese
invasion yourself

304
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,927
if that's how you're gonna do it.
I'm out, man.

305
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,138
By, by myself?

306
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:57,893
I didn't sign up for this.

307
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,592
You take your American liberation front
and you shove it up your ass!

308
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,042
That's it. Kill me.
Do whatever.

309
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,358
I can no longer conscionably be part
of the American liberation front.

310
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:09,963
Go inside. Move!

311
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:23,683
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

312
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,027
Break it in.

313
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:33,425
My God!

314
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:36,897
What the hell are you doing here?

315
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,031
You got nothing on us!

316
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,229
$700 million box office!

317
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:43,956
This is bull****!

318
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:50,483
- Boys, they got 'em.
- What?

319
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,737
They were raping a stormtrooper
when the police broke in.

320
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:59,056
And they found the dead raped bodies
of yoda and short round in their closet.

321
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,994
They'll never be free
to do this again.

322
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,336
So what now?

323
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,614
Do you think things can ever
go back to normal after all this?

324
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:07,849
What do we do?

325
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,781
We live.
That's what Indy would have wanted.

326
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,848
We just try to live.

327
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:18,971
Everyone just stay where you are
until we can sort this all out.

328
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:22,850
There's nothing to sort out!
These kids need to be put in jail!

329
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,519
We're going to search everyone

330
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,099
- and get statements and then...
- Sir! Sir, it's over!

331
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:28,688
- They got 'em.
- Got who?

332
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,435
Spielberg and Lucas, they...

333
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,318
finally got 'em for what they did
to Indiana Jones, sir.

334
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,157
They got 'em.

335
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:43,327
- They got 'em. It's over.
- It's over.

336
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:46,633
That means
they'll never be free to rape again!

337
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,489
It's over!

338
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:49,609
Justice!

339
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,735
- They got 'em!
- It's over!

340
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,508
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

341
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,045
So wait. That's it?

342
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:09,563
- What about the Chinese invasion?
- I really don't care anymore.

343
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:12,080
You see,
I've learned something today.

344
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,833
As Americans, our fear of seeing
another country become powerful

345
00:21:14,953 --> 00:21:16,236
can turn us into monsters.

346
00:21:16,731 --> 00:21:19,114
Watching how crazy you went,
watching you just

347
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:21,177
shoot people in the dick like that.

348
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:24,139
It made me realize that I want
America to be safe,

349
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,538
but not at the cost
of losing its dignity.

350
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:30,862
I rather us be Chinese, than a nation
of unethical dick-shooters.

351
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,297
You think about that.

352
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,466
Can't believe they put 'em in jail.
I thought that movie was pretty good!
