And then I saw High School Musical three again on friday and guess who was there.

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,419
Briden Gueermo.

17
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,419
Briden Gueermo, oh, he's such a dream.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,567
I'd give anything to be with Briden Gueermo.

19
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,567
But he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.

20
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,724
That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes him unique.

21
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,873
<i>Everyone is special</i>

22

31
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:45,373
I've no idea.

Who the hell is that?

44
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:22,903
That's Braden Gueermo. We 

45
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,603
Sings and dances better than anybody.

46
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,703
He's already seen HM3 over a hundred times.

47
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:30,403
<i>Everyone is special in their own--</i>

48
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,603

<i>Let it out, party people</i>

50
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:40,003
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?

51
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:42,403
Yeah. I guess, we better check that movie out.

52
00:02:44,570 --> 00:03:06,883
[singing]

53
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:08,883
This-- is cool?

54
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:12,683
[singing]

55
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,683
This is cool?

56
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,683
We are really getting old, you guys.

57
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,330
[singing]

58
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,618
It says that DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.

59
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,564
They just released part three in theaters and they did 80 millions in opening weekend.

60
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,664
Well, I'm out guys. If this is much cool today, I'm done.

61
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,179
I no longer have any connections with this world.

62
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,941
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.

63
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:38,359
Good bye, friends.

64
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:44,785
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing this.

65
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,353
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?

66
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:47,686
[mumbles]

67
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,232
All right, we promised. We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.

68
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,101
I swear.
[mumbles]

69
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,154
Okay, good.

70
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,318
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.

71
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,243
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.

72
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:12,243
You didn't die?

73
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,957
Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore.

74
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:19,276
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.

75
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:22,564
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,422
This was the wall in Germany that actually separated

77
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:28,259
the communist east side and democratic west side.

78
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:32,084
<i>East side, west side, whatever side you're on</i>

79
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:35,059
<i>as long as we care about each other we can still have some fun</i>

80
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:35,859
Oh, man.

81
00:04:35,859 --> 00:05:03,137
[singing]

82
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,153
Oh, good kids.

83
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:02,901
God! This's sucks!

84
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,550
Do you feel like maybe you l-l-loosing her, S-Stan?

85
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:15,924
I don't know. There's nothing I can do about it anyway.

86
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,944
Maybe you should just talk to her.

87
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:21,683
You know, a little conversation. Tell her what you feel.

88
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,780
Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burning in sky, do you like--

89
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,454
Stop!

90
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,280
All right, you then.

91
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:31,267
- Uh, Wendy?
- Hi, Stan.

92
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,395
Look, I just want you to know.

93
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,726
If you want to, you know, be with that Briden kid, then you should.

94
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:37,650
What?

95
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,045
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.

96
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:44,140
- Stan, that's ridiculous.
- It is?

97
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,881
I would never leave you for Briden.

98
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,330
- Really?
- No way, that'd be stupid.

99
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,081
I wouldn't have chance with Briden he could have any girl he wants.

100
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,593
There you go, feel better, p-p-pal?

101
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:01,633
What am I supposed to do?

102
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:04,405
I can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.

103
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,767
I mean, Wendy says she'll never leave me for him.

104
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,594
But what if she just doesnt wanna hurt my feelings.

105
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,054
She said he could get any girl he wants and that means

106
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,054
if he wanted, he could have my girl.

107
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:18,054
This is all so crazy. I mean, really,

108
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,054
how could my day get any worse?

109
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,174
No-no. No, I'm not doing it.

110
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,679
I'm not doing it.

111
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:31,525
No, fuck off, I'm not doing it.

112
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,232
Oh, geez, you're no fun.

113
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,131
- Hey, Briden.
- Hey.

114
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,131
- Hi, Briden.
- Hi.

115
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:44,957
- Hey, Briden.
- Hey.

116
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:46,891
Hey, kid, over here.

117
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:52,070
Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do

118
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,971
- I think, you need to ease off a little bit.
- Huh?

119
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,657
Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you but

120
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,657
actually they all getting really annoyed.

121
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:00,709
They are?

122
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,514
Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a thirdgrader

123
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,749
but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy.

124
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,756
I don't blame them. All that singing and dancing, I can't stand it.

125
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:12,141
You don't like doing it?

126
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,517
It's just don't me.

127
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,525
What I really wanna do is just-- play basketball.

128
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,525
- Basketball?
- I love it.

129
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,361
Always have. I've missed a game on TV.

130
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,908
When my dad isn't making me rehearse.

131
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,766
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.

132
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:29,290
Dude. You should do that. You should join the basketball team, right now.

133
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,492
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. What's stopping you?

134
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,726
It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies.

135
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:38,726
If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.

136
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,991
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want.

137
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,333
- Really?
- When you grow up into a fourthgrader

138
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,955
you'll understand that you'll have to be tough and direct with your parents.

139
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:50,608
Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.

140
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,713
You know, you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.

141
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:56,713
Sweet.

142
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,362
Sit up properly, Briden. You know how strict your father is about posture.

143
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,362
Holai, dear, dinner's ready.

144
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,797
Okay, let's eat.

145
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,310
Dad, I need to talk to you about something.

146
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,310
Whoo, that sounds emotional.

147
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,220
What is it, son? What's on your mind?

148
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,693
Whatever it is, you know, your dad has the time.

149
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,164
No, dad, can we just talk?

150
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:27,164
If you can talk it, you can sing it.

151
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:29,613
You can lay down the rhyme and bring it.

152
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:33,573
Just put the melody to the words that you're saying and sing it--

153
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:34,773
Dad, I wanna join basketball team.

154
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:39,434
What did you say?

155
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:42,292
This kid at school today told me I should what I wanna do.

156
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,292
That's what I really wanna do.

157
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:49,169
Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jerk.

158
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:51,169
But dad, it's what I really want.

159
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:53,832
There's no singing and dancing in basketball.

160
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,551
I know, it's kinda why I like it.

161
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,551
Don't you even think about it.

162
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:01,332
If I have a jerk for the son, I'd be the laughing stuck at the men's queer club.

163
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,879
It's my life, dad.

164
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,457
Don't make me slap you. I will slap your face so superhard

165
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,098
I'm the man of this house.

166
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,419
You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped.

167
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,998
Maybe you should let him try it.

168
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,610
What did you say, woman?

169
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,308
You aren't think fair.

170
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,671
That's it! I'm gonna slap you!

171
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,004
No, please!

172
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:27,399
I slap you. I slap you. I slap, slap, slap you.

173
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,881

00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:07,671

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,667

183
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,000
Mr. Ga-- Mr. Gary

184
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,658
This kid wants to join the basketball team, he's really good.

185
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,631
Really?

186
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,028
Look, I should be getting to class.

187
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,726
Hey, we sure could use you, kid.

188
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,982
I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball.

189
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,755
All the kids in the school fondly goes to the theatre department.

190
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:29,398
You see, they need you. This is fate, kid, fate.

191
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:30,988

192
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,803
Look, just come in and recess and shoot some balls with the team.

193
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:36,361

194
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:38,361

195
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,699
Hey, that's great, Briden.

196
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:45,429
Thanks.

197
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:47,170
We might have a chance of winning now.

198
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,255
Briden!

199
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:54,090
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Ba-bow, ba-bow, ba-bow.

200
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,487
Dad, I was just messing around.

201
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:59,828
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing music number and you weren't there.

202
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,030
You're here in the sports gym shooting baskethoops.

203
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,265
Hey, your kid is really good at this.

204
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,757
Don't talk to me, stupid jack asshole.

205
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,606
Just go easy on him, huh?

206
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,593
You know what's this means?

207
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:14,226
It means you're about to get slapped.

208
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,666
So, you're better shut up.

209
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,180
If he wants to play ball, you should let him.

210
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,845
I'll do it. I'll slap the shit out of you.

211
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,845
He's just a kid.

212
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,702
You don't tell me how to raise my sons. Slap it again!

213
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:27,012
Dad, stop!

214
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:30,601
You're trying to turn my son into little asshole sports person like yourself.

215
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,891
There, there's another slap.

216
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,028
Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-- Slap it, I'll slap it.

217
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,273
Aw, dad. Dad, you're hurting me.

218
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:39,799
Shut up, Briden.

219
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,593
Oh, what's going on here, mr. Gueermo?

220
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,957
Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?

221
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:50,179
I'll slap everyone in this goddamn school if I have to.

222
00:11:53,058 --> 00:11:55,766
You are never going to play shootinghoops, do you understand?

223
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,474
You are gonna sing and dance and be the best at it.

224
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:00,343
- You're hurting my arm.
- Don't ask, boy.

225
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,686
Oh, shit!

226
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:05,909
Oh, that's good, that's good.

227
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:08,681
Yeah, shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. Yeah, nice.

228
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,118
You guys, this HM thing isn't gonna go away.

229
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:16,310
I think we better just get on board with it.

230
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,836
What? Are you crazy?

231
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:18,868
No way dude.

232
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:21,189
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?

233
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:21,833
[mumbles]

234
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,487
I know but-- I think we're really starting become outcast at school.

235
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,141
We're loosing our creditability.

236
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:29,570
I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now.

237
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,570
Scott Malkinson for Christ sake.

238
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:35,351
What so bad about hanging out with me?

239
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:37,091
Shut up, Scott Malkinson.

240
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,272
I'm Scott Malkinson, I've got a lisp and I've got a diabetes.

241
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,077
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes.

242
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,806
Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson.

243
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:48,244
You can rip on him but you guys are hanging out with him.

244
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,759
Doesn't that make you think maybe your cloud at school has slipped a little?

245
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,822
Stan, you're just jelous about that thirdgrader.

246
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,250
And you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you're gonna start singing and dancing too.

247
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,088
[mumbles]

248
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,679
That isn't true.

249
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:00,752
Okay, that's totally true.

250
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:03,395
But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids.

251
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,945
Hey, that supposed to be my parallel pack.

252
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:09,434
That supposed to be my parallel pack, I'm Scott Malkinson I have diabetes.

253
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,107
High School Musical is so awesome.

254
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,939
- Mr. Gueermo?
- What?

255
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:25,939
We're from child protective services.

256
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,904
There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child.

257
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,568
What? Who the hell have been saying that?

258
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:34,104
We got a phone call from a concerned student.

259
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,802
Who wished to remain anonymous.

260
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,306
He's name is Stan Marsh.

261
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,691
You better just turn your asses around

262
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:43,366
and get back in your little car 'cause there's world of hurt about to come your way.

263
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,869
Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.

264
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,458
Oh, by all means, you got the balls to come in?

265
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,458
Do it-- Do it.

266
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,077
Hello Briden, my name is mr. Kelly.

267
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:01,504
We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's OK and just maybe--

268
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,169
Yeah, there it is, slapped you!

269
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,974
You probably think I'm finished, huh?

270
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,371
No, there's another one!

271
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:08,424
Oh my god!

272
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:10,424
Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you.

273
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,313
There's a slap for you.

274
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:13,517
Slap. Slap. Slap.

275
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,879
Yeah there you go. Here's the little rich round the back. That's slap.

276
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,124
Oh god, please, you have to get away, he will never stop.

277
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:23,381
I'm going slapapy.

278
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,381
I'm going slap-slap-happy.

279
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:28,753
Slapady slapping you, teaching you a lesson for coming in my house.

280
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,783
What are you looking at, Robertson?

281
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:42,851
They're here. The audition results for the school musical is here.

282
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,815
Hey, you've got the lead, Wendy.

283
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,243
Who is the male lead?

284
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,048
No surprise there, it's Briden.

285
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,959
I've got to be a stand in.

286
00:14:57,507 --> 00:15:00,472
Congratulations, Briden. Guess, we'll be working a lot together.

287
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:01,891
Yeah, great.

288
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:03,116
God damn it.

289
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:06,661
No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.

290
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,508
And now they're gonna be in the show together.

291
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,508
Jesus, it's all over for me.

292
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:14,508
They'll probably even have a kissing scene.

293
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:16,508
What did I do to deserve this?

294
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,908
And what am I supposed to do now.

295
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:28,839
<i>sooomeooone's in the kitchen with Dinah</i>

296
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,202
<i>someone's in the kitchen I knooow</i>
<i>someone's in the kitchen with Dinah</i>

297
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,992
<i>Strumming on the old banjo.</i>

<i>You can reach the stars--</i>

307
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,107
Oh, please, you have to do something.

308
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,739
What are you interrupting me for?

309
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,146
It's our son, he's-- he's running away.

310
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,671
What?

311
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,981
What's going on here? What's this all about?

312
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,667
What are you think you're doing?

313
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,103
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always--

314
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:32,003
No-no! Sing it.

315
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,739
No! I'm sick of singing.

316
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:35,931
Can you believe what he just say?

317
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,595
What's the matter with kids these days?

318
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:42,485
Kids these days--

319
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,485
Kids these days.

320
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,696
Just go right back to your room and sing a ballade, mister.

321
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:50,372
Just let me go.

322
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,080
Go ahead, make my day.

323
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:55,702
You'll get upstairs

324
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:59,075
or I will slap you until there's little red

325
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:02,263
hand, prince, all over your face.

326
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:06,382
Oh my god, what was that?

327
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,951
Did you see that?

328
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,078
Oh my god, it hurts so bad.

329
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:14,462
What the H is going on?

330
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,270
Well I had to see it to believe it.

331
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,246
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.

332
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:34,040
Actually, this is High School Musical two, it has dance along part.

333
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,747
We said, we won't be a part of this fag and look at you.

334
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,424
[mumbles]

335
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,335
Look you guys might be fine with being outcast and hanging out with Scott Malkinson but I'm not.

336
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:45,322
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some selfrespect.

337
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,911
At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave in to a peer pressure and start doing musicals.

338
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:52,199
Scott Malkinson has a list and diabetes, nobody's gonna let him do a musical.

339
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:54,199
That's enough guys, it's not cool.

340
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,189
Lots of pepole have diabetes and you shouldn't be--

341
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,818
You shouldn't rip I care for diabetes, that's not cool, I'm Scott Malkinson.

342
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:02,127
Look, guys, the world is changing.

343
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:04,684
We can't fight it, we have to change with it.

344
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,091
I've been watching these movies and from the looks of it

345
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,078
there's gonna be a lot of singing and dancing when we get to the high school.

346
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:14,161
And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals

347
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,644
then think about this.

348
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,210
Right now everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.

349
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:24,949
That's a low blow, Stan.

350
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:36,232
Through team fell on Weshe Bobkids, ... Kyles.

351
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:38,553
All right, you're ready to get in there, Bryden?

352
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:40,702
I'm ready, coach.

353
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,098
Give 'em hell.

354
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,017
Just the minute to go in the first quarter.

355
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,279
Hey, Bryden, how come your musical rehearsal last night?

356
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,912
I joined the basketball team.

357
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:34,340
I gave up singing and dancing, I'm just not in to it.

358
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
- You gave it up?
- That's right.

359
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,348
You know, sometimes you just have to go and do what your heart tells you

360
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:43,137
These things were all good at and we can't just keep them bailed up inside.

361
00:19:43,137 --> 00:21:22,371
[singing]

362
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:28,732
Where'd everybody go?

363
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:32,106
The girls and Wendy go out to see Bryden practices basketball.

364
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,663
But the girls like singing and dancing.

365
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,371
No, I think the girls just like that Bryden kid.

366
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:38,853
No matter what he does.

367
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:43,925
But-- No, we just-- no, no way, we just got--
