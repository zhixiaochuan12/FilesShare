00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,110
Students, quiet please, m'kay.

5
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,490
As you may or may not know, today is canada appreciation day.

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,430
Oh, god, I'm bored already!

7
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,470
M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the world canadian bureau.

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,340
Start the tape, please.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,010
Hello, I am stephen abootman, 

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,240
president of the world canadian bureau.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,530
Do you ever stop to think how important canada is to the world?

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,430
Right now, I would like all students of canadian descent in this school to stand up.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,580
Just look at all these fine canadians in your school.

14
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,260
See how diverse they are!

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,490
When you think of canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,950
Gayness!

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,550
That's right -- spirit.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,900
What is it that makes canada so important?

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,130
NothinG.

20
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,430
My fellow, canadians.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,460
For too long we have been pushed around and ridiculed.

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,280
Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding.

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,470
Instead, canada appreciation day was mocked worldwide!

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
Nobody takes us canadians seriously!

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,970
It's like the world don't respect canada at all!

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,800
That's right.

27
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,920
And I think it's time for canada to show the world

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,000
just how bad things would be without it.

29
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,850
Together we can send a message!

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,850
It's time for canada to strike!

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,220
Did you say "strike"?

32
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,050
Yes!

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,470
Every canadian join me!

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,750
Join together.

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,900
Canada on strike!

36
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,330
Canada on strike!

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,030
Canada. Canada. Canada. Canada.

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Canada on strike.

39
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,930
Canada says no more!

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,600
No more neglect.We want respect.

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,180
That's what we're striking for!

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,730
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats --

43
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,270
Can all take a hike!

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,730
It's canada.

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,540
On strike!

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,820
Canada on strike from vancouver to st.John's

47
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,980
we raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon

48
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,060
and with our fingers up your ass you won't be very psyched

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,120

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,650
and we will not bow or budge our resolve is strong

51
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,830
we even took three hours to reverse this striking song

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,990
canada on strike no matter where you are

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,290
if you are canadian then you've got to do your part

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,660
march out of the halls That's right!

55
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,230
Suck my canadian balls.

56
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,380
It's canada on strike!

57
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,660
It's canada!

58
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,490
Canada on strike!

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,250
Uh, when you say "canada is on strike, " what exactly do you mean?

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,640
What do you think it means?

61
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,720
We're striking, buddy.

62
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,800
No more! That's it until we get what we want.

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,560
Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,010
I am stephen abootman, leader of the W.G.A.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,470
The W.G.A.?

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,380
YeS.

67
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,350
The world canadian bureau.

68
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,050
What exactly does canada want?

69
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,800
We want more money.

70
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,260
Yeah, more money.

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,490
More money from where?

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,990
Just more money, you know!

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
Canada doesn't get enough money.

74
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,100
Other countries have lots of money.

75
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,510
We want some of that money.

76
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,960
How about the internet?

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,330
The internet makes lots of money.

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,910
Give us some of that money.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,780
Yeah! Give us internet money!

80
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,100
Mr.Abootman, you seem to not understand how global economics works.I think that --

81
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,590
Don't give me that fat cat fancy lip wiggling!

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,040
Are you going to give canada more money or not?

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,240
I'm afraid we can'T.

84
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,350
Then you leave canada no choice.

85
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,350
The strike shall continue!

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Honk if you support canada.

87
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,240
Honk if you support canada.

88
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,870
Hey, honey, watch this.

89
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,550
We're supporting unions!

90
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,100
That's right.We're a very progressive couple!

91
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,170
Yes!

92
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,550
Oh, that's fun!

93
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,140
Well, we've done our good deed for the week.

94
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,780
I think now i can make love to your anus without making god angry.

95
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,690
Oh, really?

96
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Goodie!

97
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,230
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.

98
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,180
We don't care.

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,270
You should care!

100
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,900
This strike affects everybody, fat ass.

101
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,160
It's on!

102
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,160
Yippie!

103
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,020
It's the terrance and phillip show.

104
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,960
Today's episode "I fart huckabees.

105
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,910
Aw, this one again?

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,170
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Say phillip, I just bought this new hyy bid car.

108
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,300
Oh, does it run on electricity?

109
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,130
No, it uses natural gas.

110
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,000
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.

111
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,670
Goddammit, when are we gonna air new terrance and phillip shows?

112
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,990
There aren't going to be new shows.Don't you get it?

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,670
Terrance and phillip are canadian!

114
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,860
We have to get canada to end this strike!

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,030
It's not a big deal.

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,230
We can just american comedy.

117
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,720
You think that's bad?

118
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,890
Remember the time I sang "la cucaracha" for paul mccartney.

119
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,970
No!

120
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,860
We are not resorting to that!

121
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,120
One, two, three, four, canada deserves more!

122
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,940
Money!

123
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,740
Look, bugs.

124
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,490
H me and phillip need to go home for a bit.

125
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,340
Go home?

126
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,930
You can't leave the picket line!

127
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,770
But this is taking too long and phillip is diabetic.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,850
Look, guy, we all have to stay strong.

129
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,680
If you don't stand with your fellow canadians, then you are a rat.

130
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,190
Don't call me a ramit buddy.

131
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm not your buddy, friend.

132
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,600
He's not your friend, guy.

133
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,150

I'm not your friend, guy.

136
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,030
Don't you two understand anything?

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,830
You think striking is a joke?

138
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,740
You think it's something to ridicule?

139
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,730
Yeah, you think this is funhe'?

140
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,550
Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we are nothing.

141
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,910
Stephefu stephen!

142
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
A call came in from the united states.

They want to talk to you about ending the strike!

144
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,480

All right, well, we're prepared to end the strike

157
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,270
if you are agreeing that we should have more money.

158
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,640
We totally think you should have more money.

159
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
We got 'em!

160
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,370
We did it!

161
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,950
It's over!

162
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,690
How much are you gonna give us?

163
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,520
Well, we don't really have that much money.

164
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,990
Oh, negotiating hard ball, are we?

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,590
What about all that internet money?

166
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,720
The internet?

167
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,950
You listen to me.

168
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,570
You better fi Gre out a way to get us our fair amount of money.

169
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,640
And until you come back with a solid fair number, 

170
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,170
I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!

171
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,800
Don't worry, don't worry!

172
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,150
This is how negotiating works.

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
This is good.

174
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,240
We've got 'em by the balls.

175
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,660
What A they sally

176
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,900
They said we have to give them money that we make on the internet.

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,300
How are we supposed to make money on the internet?

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,250
Well, how do other people make money on the internet?

179
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,080
We A have to put something up on the internet

180
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,080

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,360
so he needs everyone to think the strike was for something.

360
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,460
Just give him anything.

361
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,930
Well, we could give canada some small consolation prize.

362
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,040
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?

363
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,350
Will they act like they're giving canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?

364
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,230
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?

365
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,470
Sure, why not?

366
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,890
We have won!

367
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,220
So how much did we get?

368
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,160
Well, we, we didn't get everything that we wanted, 

369
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,810
but we negotiated hard

370
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,200
and we got these coupons to bennigans

371
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,970
and free bubble gum for every canadian!

372
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,500
These coupons entitle every canadian to a free meal at bennigans!

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,640
With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.

374
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,770
We did it!

375
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,590
My friends, this is the greatest victory in canadian history!

376
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,940
Ike.

377
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,590
Ike!

378
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,530
It's over.

379
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,640
It's over?

380
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,870
Yeah, here you go.

381
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,060
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.

382
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,410
Me too!

383
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,640
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.

384
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,910
We thought we could make money on the internet, 

385
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,210
but while the internet is new and exciting for creative people, 

386
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,800
it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent

387
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,750
that one should trade real or immediate opportunities

388
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,930
for income for the promise of future online revenue.

389
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,570
It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the internet

390
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,140
can be monetized to an extent that necessitates content producers

391
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,890
to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.

392
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,620
Yeah.

393
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,720
We did it!

394
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,050
Celebrate, everyone!

395
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,180
Hold on a minute.

396
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,480
Wait just a second.

397
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,790
We just did some calculating.

398
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,240
By not working during the strike, canadians lost $10.4 million.

399
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,200
And our bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly $3, 008.

400
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,150
Don't look at that.Come on, friends, let's dance.

401
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,530
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it

402
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,510
look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!

403
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,110
Dammit, friends, don't you see?

404
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
We won for future canadians, guy.

405
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,200
So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore.

406
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,260
This was a victory for canada's respect.

407
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,190
What do you think you're doing?

408
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,700
We're setting you adrift, idiot.

409
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,090
Maybe you can go live with the danish!

410
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,940
You'll regret this day, frienD.

411
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,810
I'm not your friend, buddy!

412
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm not your buddy, guy!

413
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,280
He's not your guy, friend!

414
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm not your friend, buddy!

415
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,060
We're not your buddies, guy!

416
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,080
I'm not your guy, friends!
