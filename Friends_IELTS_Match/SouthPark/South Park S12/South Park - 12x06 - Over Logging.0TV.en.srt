00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,100
Get off the internet,
stanley. It's time for bed.

5
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,950
Mom, I just got to do
a couple more things.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,000
Now, stanley! The internet will
be waiting for you in the morning.

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,260
Off!

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,650
Aw, man!

9
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,690
Shelley, off the internet. It's bedtime.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,180
Mom, I'm I-chatting with
my boyfriend in montana.

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,310
Now, shelley!

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,390
Why do you hate me?

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,070
Randy, off the internet.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,650
No! No, come on! Leave me alone.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,640
No, mister. It's time for night-night.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,600
But sharon, I got stuff to do!

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,050
I got to see my credit rating and
i got to send an e-mail to nelson

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,340
and check out foley's
vacation photos --

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,110
You don't have to do all that now.

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,220
You can do one more thing
and then it's bedtime.

21
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,490
One more thing?

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,510
Oooh, yeah.

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,600
What the hell?

24
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,250
Stan!

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,260
- Stan, i got to use your computer.
- What?

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,370
My internet's not working.
I got to use yours.

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,480
And give daddy some
private time, will yeah?

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,980
- My internet's not working either.
- What?

29
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,040
Dad, the internet's not working!

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,450
I know that, okay?

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,040
I have to get online with my
darling amir before school starts.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,440
Randy, i can't get my e-mail to open.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,680
Everyone just calm down.
Calm down, all right?

34
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,250
It's going to be okay.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,380
We just can't panic.

36
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,130
Gerald, please help us.

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,240
Randy! What's happened?

38
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,540
Our house. It has no internet.

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,150
Oh, my god.

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,850
We've got nothing.

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,520
It's just gone.

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,370
Come in. You can use our internet
until you figure out what to do.

43
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,820
Thank you, gerald.

44
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,310
I'm getting on it first.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,660
Oh, no, you're not!

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,900
Kyle, can I use your internet?

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,520
- It's not working.
- What?

48
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,380
I've even unplugged it
and plugged it back in.

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,000
No, no. Our internet can't be broken.

50
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,820
I've got to get an attachment
larry sent me last night!

51
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,160
It's not working, gerald.

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,640
But it has to
work. Maybe if I --

53
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,360
Your internet's not
working, gerald. Face it!

54
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,980
I have to get online before school.

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,830
What about starbucks?
They have free internet.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,050
Right! Starbucks!

57
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,090
Everyone get your stuff.
We can take my car.

58
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,420
Hey, is your guys' internet working?

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,370
No. Nobody's is.

60
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,710
What's happening?

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,190
Jesus, everyone's gonna
have to go to starbucks now.

62
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,180
Everyone in the car! We
have to beat them there!

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,870
God, the whole neighborhood's affected.

64
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,850
Get out of the way, peterson!

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,060
Folks, there's no internet here.

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,520
It's not working, I tell you.

67
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,920
It's not working here?

68
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,190
Kids, get back in the car.
We can go to the mac store.

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,050
N, don't! You're wasting your time.

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,090
How do you know?

71
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,090
Because we just came from there.

72
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,160
There was nothing.

73
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,030
Not one scrap of internet.

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,830
How can there be no internet anywhere?

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,940
What's going on?

76
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,180
Anybody got a blackberry?

77
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,580
Check drudge report.

78
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,000
Good idea! No, wait!

79
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,450
We can't check drudge
report. There's no internet.

80
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,650
There has to be a way to
find out what's going on.

81
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
We can't! Don't you get it?

82
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,080
There's no internet to find
out why there's no internet!

83
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,250
What did we use to get the
news before the internet?

84
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,690
A television!

85
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,150
Reporter: Once again, we apologize
but we cannot bring you the news.

86
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,380
It appears that we have
no internet here at news 4.

87
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,080
We'll be happy to bring
you up on current events.

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,890
Just as soon as our internet is back.

89
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,740
Jesus, it's statewide.

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
It could be nationwide.

91
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,790
Hello? Do you have internet?

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,560
It's channel four news.

93
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,570
No, we don't have internet either.

94
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,560
No internet anywhere.

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,970
Jesus, we're all alone.

96
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,670
MONDAY

97
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,820
8 DAYS WITHOUT INTERNET

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,250
What's the matter?

99
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,610
I don't know.

100
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,070
I need to get on webmd and see
why I have this cough, but I can'T.

101
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,170
What if my sweetheart
is online looking for me?

102
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,080
He could be wondering why
I don't get online with him.

103
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,710
Maybe he thinks I'm dead.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,620
If my darling amir gets another internet
girlfriend, I'm going to kill him.

105
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,470
And you!

106
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,520
Shelley! Shelley, woa, stop! Stop!

107
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,130
Dad, you got to do something!
She's out of control.

108
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,200
You're right. We can't
just sit here any longer.

109
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Randy, where will you go?

110
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,810
We're gonna head west.

111
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,270
There's a rumor going around that
there might be some internet out there.

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,200
So we're heading out california way.

113
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,420
You don't know if there's
any internet in california!

114
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,190
Well, there certainly ain't none here!

115
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,700
Look, maybe it's time
you all face reality.

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,470
The internet here is dried up.

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,680
It could come back.

118
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,040
Yeah, and maybe it won'T.

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,170
In the meantime, I got a family
who needs internet right away.

120
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,690
We'll head out california way
and, and see what we can find.

121
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,410
Come on. Let's gO.

122
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,230
Look, if you do find internet,
let us know, will you?

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,250
How? You won't have internet.

124
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,580
California NEED******

125
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,270
Sorry, folks. We're full up.

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,540
Know anywhere else we can stay?

127
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,620
We're heading out california way.

128
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,960
Looking for some internet.

129
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,440
You and everyone else.

130
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,040
You'll have to stay out at the transient camp
with all the others heading to california.

131
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,880
It's about a mile down the road.

132
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,910
* I'm going down the road feeling bad *

133
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,200
* I'm going down the road feeling bad *

134
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,820
* I'm going down the road feeling bad *

135
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,110
* oh, lordy my internet
done up and went away *

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,750
Where are you from, old-timer?

137
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,190
Kansas city.

138
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,820
Had me a store there, a kind
of computer supply store.

139
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,870
When the internet went,
the stores went too.

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,670
Things I'll be different
when we get to california.

141
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,750
Soon as we get us some
internet we can all rest easy.

142
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,910
Why sure.

143
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,200
They*********

144
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,430

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,520
********

146
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,730
Oh, I'm gonna sit down at t that
internet and just start e-mailing.

147
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,440
Just keep on e-mailing 'til my
fingers are sore to the bone!

148
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,800
Sure will be nice.

149
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,660
You folks all heading to silicon valley?

150
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,020
That's right. We need to get online.

151
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,360
Get online, he says.

152
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,700
What's so funny about that?

153
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,910
Think about it.

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,380
How many folks heading
out to california?

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,390
A million? More?

156
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,250
How much internet you
think they got out there?

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,590
Be some internet, sure, but with
everyone trying to use it at once,

158
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,890
it's gonna go real slow like.

159
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,340
I knows because I seen it.

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,760
My two children, they
tried to load a webpage.

161
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,860
Took them over three days.

162
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,040
They sat there waiting,

163
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,590
by the time the loading bar was
only half full they was dead.

164
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,740
Starved on the internet.

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,810
With their bellies stuck
out like a pig bladder.

166
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,950
Come on, stan. Let's get us some rest.

167
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,620
Amir, I miss you so much.

168
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,850
Don't cry, shelley.

169
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,890
You'll be able to get online
when we get to california.

170
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,400
Everyone, wake up, we're here!

171
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,130
Silicon valley, california!

172
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,790

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,390

00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,880
Service provider.

177
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,730
Net zero.

178
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,780
All right. Stay in
line once you're inside.

179
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,450
Red cross volunteers will
direct you to your campsite.

180
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,250
So, is there internet here?

181
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,820
Stay in line and get to your campsite.

182
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,470
Excuse me. We're looking
for some internet.

183
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, they got it here.

184
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,800
All right!

185
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,670
Bud there ain't enough to go around.

186
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,800
All they got is a little internet.

187
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,910
Barely a bar a signal.

188
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,350
So they have to ration it out carefully.

189
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,930
You sign up over there.

190
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,960
And use your time when
they call your name.

191
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,820
Each family gets 40
seconds of internet per day.

192
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,320
40 seconds?

193
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,850
That ain't even long
enough to check wikipedia!

194
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,190
Well, it's all we got
so we got to make do.

195
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,780
Look, honey. I ordered
us some books on amazon!

196
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,850
All right. Time's up.

197
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,010
No, no, wait! I haven't entered
the shipping information.

198
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,000
No! No!

199
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,550
Next! Grady, john H.

200
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,960
Aw, how am I supposed to
see internet porn that way?

201
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,370
What did you say?

202
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,640
Uh, you go on ahead, sharon, divide
some internet amongst the children.

203
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,780
I got to go talk to somebody.

204
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,920
Reporter: And that's about all we know.

205
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,070
There might be some internet still
in california, and parts of florida.

206
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,340
Though, we certainly
still don't have any here.

207
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,020
A fax! A fax is coming through!

208
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,140
- We got a fax!
- Yeah, a fax!

209
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,840
It says the government has sent
their best people to the internet

210
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,840
in order to repair it.

211
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,680
We got to get a reporter
out to the internet.

212
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,260
Where is the internet?

213
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,390
Gentlemen, president is very angry
that his internet still isn't working.

214
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,000
We've tried everything, sir.

215
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,420
But the internet has slowed to a trickle
and we can't get it working correctly.

216
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,810
Take me down below.

217
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,290
I want to see the internet for myself.

218
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,820
Here it is, general. The internet.

219
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,900
So what's wrong with it?

220
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,830
See that flashing
orange light in the mid?

221
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,140
It's supposed to be solid green.

222
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,750
My god.

223
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,400
Thedancingkitty.Com.
I wonder what that is?

224
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,190
Click on the dancing kitty
and you could win a prize.

225
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,220
All right, time's up.

226
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,470
No wait. I just clicked
on the kitty. I got it!

227
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,250
No! It wasn't long enough! No!

228
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,840
Next. Nelson, peter T.

229
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,870
Excuse me.

230
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,010
I need to uh, have some
private internet time.

231
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,640
Look, we're just trying to get by here.

232
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,540
Everyone's got to
take what they can get.

233
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,210
I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.

234
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,550
So jack off.

235
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,510
You don't understand.

236
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,270
I need the internet to jack off.

237
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,640
I got used to being able to see anything
at the click of a button, you know?

238
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,610
Once you jack off to japanese
girls puking in each other's mouth,

239
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,820
you can't exactly go back to "playboy."

240
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,960
What do you want us to do?

241
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,170
Pick up the whole computer and put it
inside for ten minutes just for you?

242
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,960
- Three minutes would be plenty.
- Get lost.

243
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,340
All right. Each of you take a ticket.

244
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,740
When they call your name,
you can use the internet.

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,460
What number are you, turd?

246
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,060
You're 923 now.

247
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,740
Hey, mom!

248
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,840
Shelley, give your
brother his ticket back.

249
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,890
Can't you all see I'm in pain?

250
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,230
Nobody understands pure love.

251
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,190
Amir and I are closer than
anybody in this stupid family!

252
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,300
Over here.

253
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,780
You. Happen to be
looking for internet porn?

254
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,470
Yeah. How'd you know?

255
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,290
Lots of us fellas came
here for that reason.

256
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,170
We all got used to seeing lots of
really perverted stuff on the internet,

257
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,370
so now we can't go back to "playboy."

258
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,940
I know! Right?

259
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,380
Anyway, we got us a simulator.

260
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,640
You just call out what you
want to see and then say click.

261
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,950
Internet porn stimulator.

262
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,170
Give it a try.

263
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,410
Anything you wanted to see
with the click of a button!

264
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,930
Uh, japanese girls exchanging
bodily fluids. Click.

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,290
Oh, this sucks! I
can't jack off to this!

266
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,460
Dammit.

267
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,660
Uh, let's see. Gang bang. Click.

268
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,980
She-males. Let's
try she-males. Click.

269
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,280
Bestialty. Click on that.

270
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,600
Brazilian fart fetish
porn? Click. Click.

271
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,310
Nope. This isn't gonna work.

272
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,780
It's just not the same.

273
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,060
Well, sorry.

274
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,970
That'll be $49 on your credit card.

275
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,630
Well, at least that
part's like the internet.

276
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,960
We now have a reporter on
the scene. Let's go live!

277
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,100
Tom, I am at the internet

278
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,360
government officials are doing
their best to get it running again.

279
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,760
All right, internet.

280
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,860
What do you want from us?

281
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,590
If we've angered you
somehow, let us know.

282
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,980
Try to communicate
with it digitally again.

283
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,060
I've had it with this thing.
Fire a warning shot at it.

284
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,860
Hey, wait a minute.

285
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,770
Is it possible
that --

286
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,080
What is it, kyle?

287
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,400
I think I know what's wrong.

288
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,380
This is taking too long.

289
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,110
When do I get to use the internet?

290
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,630
It's got to be our turn soon.

291
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,010
All right, folks. It's bedtime.

292
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,380
No more internet for today

293
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,080
Just a little longer.

294
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,170
No, no. We're locking it away
'til tomorrow. Everyone get to bed.

295
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:33,290
Finally! I'm online again! Yes!

296
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,670
Japanese girls puke
in each other's mouths.

297
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,590
Oh, nice!

298
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,540
Now let's see some bestialty.

299
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,100
Yes!

300
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,780
Let's get some brazilian
fart porn in there.

301
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,060
That's got it!

302
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,980
What is that?

303
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,160
Sounds like somebody's
being attacked by a tiger.

304
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,670
Get the keys. We got to get in there!

305
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,190
What
the --

306
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,270
- Dad?
- Randy!

307
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,970
Oh, uh, there was a, a ghost!

308
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,140
This is ectoplasm!

309
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,450
Did you see the ghost?

310
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,870
It ran through here and slimed me!

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,380
You son of a bitch!

312
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,920
No, it wasn't me. It
was the spooky ghost!

313
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,170
This is our last chance.

314
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,830
With nowhere else to turn, the government
is going to allow one brave 8-year-old boy

315
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,770
to attempt his method to get
the internet running again.

316
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,470
It all comes down to this.

317
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,700
Can the little jewish boy reason with
the internet, or will it be gone forever?

318
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,900
All clear for procedure.

319
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,170
All right. Let's do it.

320
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,130
Look! The flashing yellow
light is steady green now!

321
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,440
He did it!

322
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,350
- I've got internet!
- Me too!

323
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,500
Internet activity in all sectors, sir!

324
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,960
- I've got internet.
- Me too.

325
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,570
It's back!

326
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,070
It's back? It's back!

327
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,700
It's working!

328
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,450
I can I-chat with my darling amir now!

329
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,620
Shelley? Shelley marsh?

330
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,760
What?

331
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,420
It's me. Amir.

332
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,860
Your family came here too,

333
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,510
Yeah.

334
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,140
So, uh, I guess I'll e-mail
you as soon as we get back home.

335
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,560
Yeah, okay, sounds good.

336
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,010
Okay, c'ya.

337
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,000
We're back together!
We're back together!

338
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,930
And so what have we
learned through this ordeal?

339
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,390
The internet went away, it came back.

340
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,480
But for how long we do not know.

341
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,930
We cannot take the internet
for granted any longer.

342
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,570
We as a country must
stop overlogging-on.

343
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,140
We must use the internet
only when we need it.

344
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,290
It's easy for us to think we can
just use up all the internet we want,

345
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,950
but if we don't treat the
internet with the respect

346
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,090
that it deserves,

347
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,030
it could one day be gone forever.

348
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,640
And so let us learn to live
with the internet, not for it.

349
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,480
No more browsing for no apparent reason.
