00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,430
Okay. Chilildren, let's
all take our seats.

5
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,710
Before we get started today.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,070
Wendy testaburger has asked to
share something with the clasS.

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,090
Wendy?

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,860
Thank you,mr. GarrisoN.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,180
Fellow students, october is awareness month for
the one of the leading causes of death for womeN.

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,500
A disease that takes the lives
of american women every day.

11
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,150
I'm talking of course
about breast canceR.

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,180
An estimated one in six women will
deal with cancer in their lifetime

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,670
and breast cancer is
the most common --.

14
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,990
She said it again.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,130
Is there a problem? Because isn't funny.

16
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,230
Breast cancer is killing people.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,600
Mr. Garcia, do we really need all
of this potty talk in the classroom?

18
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,010
Eric, f for the love of jesus.

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,330
This is a serious issue eric,
what you're doing is offensivE.

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,860
Me, you're the one talking
about killer titties,

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,610
watch out wendy,guys, went
day says boobs can kill you.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,060
I don't want to get killed by boobs.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,640
Will somebody do something.

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,820
Every week he gets worse
and nobody does anything.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,620
Eric, stop being offensivE.

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,820
I'm trying to engage wendy in a constructive
dialog about breast cancer awareness.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,240
No, you aren'T.

28
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,620
Wendy, you better calm down,

29
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,420
you'll get your boobs angry and
they'll start killing everyone.

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm on fire today!

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,760
Look out everyone, there's some
killer titties on the loose.

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,830
Could have swore i heard
them coming through the roof.

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,910
Officer, we need to get an apb out on
those titties, they're armed and dangerous.

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,350
What is your problem?

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Testify breast cancer isn't funny.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,940
Not at all.

37
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,830
Wendy, we are going to get you wendy, where
are your boobs we are going to kill you.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,130
You better shut up or
i'll make you shouldn'T.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,560
Really, what are you
going to do about it wendy?

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm going to kick your ass,
that's what I am going to do.

41
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,790
Your gonna kick my ass?

42
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,410
That's right, i am gonna kick my ass.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,950
You want to throw down,
dawg, I'll throw down.

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,160
You think you're tough.

45
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,810
What's up?What's up?

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,280

That's right.

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,880
You're a chick, dudE.

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,480
As soon as that bell rings we do
it outside and you better be there.

53
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,670
It's on bitch.

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,060

55
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,000

Gee, i can't wait, wendy

65
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,900
She is pissed off.

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,370
She's not gonna show
up to a fight, dawG.

67
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,090
I'm sure she's already tried to
figure out a way to get out of it.

68
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,040
Hey, check it out, she's
totally staring you down.

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,720
you don't want to put
her in pt hospital.

I'm gonna teach her a lesson, I'm
not gonna totally kick her ass.

72
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,570
Can't go too easy on her, god
forbid she gets a good punch iN.

73
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah, if you get beat by a girl,
everyone would think you're a faggot.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,180
Wendy, could i talk to you for a second?

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640

Actually i was thinking let's
just keep this between us.

84
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,490
I was wrong to make fun of breast
cancer and I'm very remorsefulness.

85
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,710
No, if you're really sorry and
you want to apologize to me,

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,560
That's not what i said dumb bitch.

Yes, you did, you stood there and said
you apologized and don't want to fight.

90
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,250
Wendy, a desperate
attempt to get out testify.

91
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,390
These students are too smart to see you're
making excuses to get out of fighting mE.

92
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,060
I am i don't want to get out it.

And you're going to just let at
that guy beat up on your woman?

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,210
Doesn't that like go against
your jockey man code or something?

100
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,650
Yeah, i don't ever remember ac/dc singing about
letting it dudes beat up on their girlfriends.

101
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,450
What am i supposed to do about it?

102
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,940
Don't worry, stan, I don't
think it's going to happen.

103
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Cartman says that wendy is begging
him to it call the fight off.

104
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,750
******

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,890

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,560
I was a real jerk and now they're
gonna cut off my mom's boobS.

111
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,360
You really think that's
going to work on me?

112
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,960
Wendy, i have here $27 in cash.

dystrophy in her boobs.

122
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,710
Okay, wendy, I'll eat my
underwear right here and right now.

123
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,840
Jesus crys do you have
no sense of self-respecT.

124
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,330
No, unless you want me to, if

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,790

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,660
*******

145
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,610
she told me she doesn't
want to fight.******

146
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,540
She knows i am gonna kick her ass and feels if she
doesn't fight me the girls will call her chicken.

147
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,720
Really?

148
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,730
Now what she did, she apologized
and begged me not to fight heR.

149
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,820
I said if you're sorry, stay it in
front of everyone, but she wouldn'T.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
That's how desperate these.

151
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,400
You have to do something, stan, you
have to. Be a man and forbid her --.

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,720
Oh, that's where i put those.

153
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,680
Anyway, stan, you've got
to put a stop to the fight.

154
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,720
Wendy needs you.

155
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,920
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.

156
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,030
God, you are such a pusy,
stan, you're a pussy,

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,910
when i hurt wendy it will be on

158
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,710
And so you see at this point your rip
disease knew he could not win the battle.

159
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm going to wipe the playground
with you right in front of everyonE.

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,700
If you got beat by a girl
everyone would say you're a faggot.

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,100
For homework, i want you
all to read chapter seven.

162
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,180
Take this Wendy!

163
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,890
When the bell rings we've got to get out
there and find a good place to watch this.

164
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,730
There's no way out, she's gonna
kick my ass in front of everyone.

165
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,010

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,070
Eric

178
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,670

179
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,320
Everyone is start to go say you got detention
on purpose to get out of fighting wendy.

180
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,890
RidiculouS.

181
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,360
Some people say you crapped
on the desk to get detention.

182
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,660
********

183
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,390
Why did you crap on the desK.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
*******

185
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:42,410
I'm anti-establishment, that's how
i roll, dawg, i do stuff like that.

186
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,110
I said he's not scared of fighting
wendy, he'd do it if he could.

187
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,480
I got all punk rock and
got detention, a bad dudE.

188
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,150
That's good because we moved the fight
to first thing tomorrow morning tomorrow

189
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
before school starts. Everyone
is going to get there early.

190
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,980
That way it doesn't matter
that you have detention.

191
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,210
Eric, get your buns back over here.

192
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,220
Wendy says she will be there an hour before
school starts, see you in the morning, okay?

193
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,090
Tomorrow morning, you
die tomorrow morning.

194
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,160
- Wendy!
- Yeah?

195
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,120
We need to talk to you right now!

196
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,650
Wendy, have you been
bullying kids at school?

197
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
What? No!

198
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,120
Well, do you want to explain why this
little boy's mother had to come talk to us?

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,810
Did you tell this little boy
you were going to beat him up?

200
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,110
You don't understand
he said horrible thingS.

201
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,710
The thing is, I totally said I was
sorry, but she still wants to beat me up.

202
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,510
Wendy, no matter what a person says,
you don't respond with violence.

203
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,360
Haven't we taught you that?

204
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,560
The thing swendy, i really
think you're awesome,

205
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,410
and i know I'm just a nerdy
little weakling to you,

206
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,860
but i want to be your friend because I
don't have that many friends at school.

207
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,470
Wendy, you tell this little boy
you aren't going to hurt him!

208
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,190
- Mom, you don't --.
- Now, young lady.

209
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm not going to hurt you.

210
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,190
If there's any word of you fighting at school,
it's over for you missy, do you understand?

211
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,570
Yes, sir.

212
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,520
We're so sorry about this, miss cartman.

213
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,090
Oh, no, thank you so much for your time.

214
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,190
It really won't happen again.

215
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,790
You're very sweet. Thank
you again. Come on, muffiN.

216
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,190
Okay, mommy, ma ma, ma ma.

217
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,260
Man, it's almost time for school
to start. Wendy still isn't here.

218
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,520
Yeah, I don't know what's
going on. I showed up.

219
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,440
Where is she?

220
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,450
How come wendy is not
showing up for the fight.

221
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,700
Here she comes!

222
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,960
What's up, wendy i thought we
were meeting early to fight.

223
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,030
Now i can't fight you.

224
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,650
Why not? You chicken? It
bwawk bwawk bwawk, bwawk bwawK.

225
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,300
I can't fift you because you came crying
to my house last night with your mom.

226
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,980
Oh, that's a doozie, wendy, did you
come up with that one on your own.

227
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,350
Yeah, you come up with
that one on your owner?

228
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,420
I ain't frontin' dawg, let's do it.

229
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,040
Come on, wendy kick his ass!

230
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,340
I can't!

231
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,000
God dammit,

232
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,100
she chickened out.

233
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,800
Told you guys!

234
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,410
Oh, i'm glad that's over witH.

235
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,500
Yeah, guess who dodged
a bullet, galahad.

236
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,340
I always knew deep down
wendy didn't have any.

237
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,980
And so we must all recycle every day.

238
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,920
Recycling is important and
it will save our planet earth.

239
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,560
The end.

240
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,690
Very nice, clyde.

241
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,850
Okay, we have time for more more report
before recess, who would like to go?

242
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,380
Okay, eric.

243
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,530
Thank you.

244
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,580
My report today is on
breast cancer awareness.

245
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,070
I do not believe enough is being done
and like the victims of breast cancer,

246
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,720
there's something I'd
like to get off my chest.

247
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,940
We all must fight and hopefully kid
titty cancer will be a distant memory.

248
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,670
You unbelieveable bastard.

249
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,380
You beat me, but you won't stop.

250
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,350
What did the breast cancer
say to the polish monkey.

251
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay, eric, that's enough you smart ass.

252
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,020
Why, why are you doing this to me?

253
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,570
Why won't you just stop.

254
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,780
Wendy, wendy.

255
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,660
Wendy testaburger to the
principal's office, please?

256
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,450
Wendy testaburger to
the principal's office.

257
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,250
God!

258
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,300
Wendy, i've been hearing rum irs of
a fight between you and eric cartman.

259
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
No, man there isn't going to be a fight.

260
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,330
Oh, no? Are you sure.

261
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,220
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,900
I see.

263
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,750
I noticed all the things you've done
for breast cancer awareness month.

264
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,250
Did you know I'm a
breast cancer survivor?

265
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,330
Ma'am?

266
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,150
I was diagnosed seven years ago.

267
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,290
Cancer is it pure evil, it's a fat
little lump that needs to be destroyed.

268
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,730
When there is a cancer,
you have to fight it.

269
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,390
You can't reason with cancer,
you can't wish it away.

270
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,240
Cancer doesn't play by the
rules so neither can you.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,440
My parents said
that if i fight--.

272
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:01,070
And you can't listen to
what anybody else tells you.

273
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,500
You have to be willing to give up everything
because the cancer will take everything.

274
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,270
Do you understand?

275
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,060
Yes, ma'am!

276
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,180
When you have cancer, you fight because
it doesn't matter if you beat it or not.

277
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,050
Yo u refuse to let that fat little
lump think you feel powerless.

278
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,660
She's gonna fight.

279
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,860
Wendy's gonna fight cartman right now.

280
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,960
What?

281
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,830
********Not that dude, retard.

282
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,450
She's coming.

283
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,470
******

284
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,800
Wendy is coming to fight you.

285
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,180
Oh, boy, here we go.

286
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,020
About freaking time.

287
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,730
All right. Let's do it!

288
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,930
Wendy, what's up? What's up?

289
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,110
Wendy, don't forget
I'll tell my mom on you.

290
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,270
I don't care.

291
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,760
Recess is almost over, i don't
know if there's really time.

292
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,180
Shut up and fight!

293
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,630
All right, wine, wendy, i'll fight you.

294
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,460
Him up, wendy!

295
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,250
Wendy?

296
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,460
I'm finished.

297
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,870
Somebody, somebody call the principal!

298
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,310
You have don't have to say anything.

299
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,360
I know how it iS.

300
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm no longer the cool kid.

301
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,150
Now you all think i'm a fag.

302
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,270
My school life is over because now
all the guys don't think i'm cool.

303
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,310
Dude, we never thought you were cooL.

304
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,340
That's not true.

305
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,870
You're just saying that.

306
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,960
No, really, we've
always thought you suck.

307
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,180
Yeah, nothing's changed.

308
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,970
Our opinion of you can't
possibly go any lower.

309
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,940
You're just saying that
to make me feel betteR.

310
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,650
No, it's truE. We've always hated you.

311
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,950
Yeah.

312
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
Don't try and make me
feel better, you guys.

313
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,670
Wait, wait a minute, why would you guys
be saying stuff to make me feel better?

314
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,060
Unless, unless you do think I'm cool.

315
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,120
What?

316
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,500
If you're all trying to make me feel
better then you must still like me.

317
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,300
I've been so worried about you guys were
going to think of me getting beat up by a girL.

318
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,360
It turns out you think
I'm cool no matter what!

319
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,040
Oh, oh, oh, god, what a relief!

320
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,340
Yea!
