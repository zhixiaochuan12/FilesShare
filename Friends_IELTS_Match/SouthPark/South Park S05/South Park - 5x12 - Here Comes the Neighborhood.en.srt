Captioning made possible by
comedy central

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,210
? I'm going down
to south park?

3
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:11,629
? Gonna have
myself a time?

4
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,013
? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,748
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,699
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,343
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:19,918
? Ample parking
day or night?

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,471
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:21,506 --> 00:00:23,115
? Headin' on up
to south park?

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,724
? Gonna see
if i can't unwind?

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,363
? So come on down
to south park?

13
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,532
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,201
And so,
just like in nature,

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,838
I can add the mixture
into the volcano and-

16
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,875
Oh, pele, god of fire,
show us your-

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,876
Oh, it's all g-Gooey.

18
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,646
Okay, good job, butters,
you get a check.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,346
Thank you,
miss choksondik.

20
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,081
I got a check,
that's like a "c".

21
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,285
Okay, whose project
should we look at next?

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,020
How about... eric.

23
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,755
Eric cartman.

24
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,057
Stand by, please.

25
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:57,924
Now, eric!

26
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,225
Oh, goddammit!

27
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,058
Ha, ha!

28
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,394
Shut up, jew!

29
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,094
Yes, well.

30
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,165
For my project i made a pencil,
taped to a pen.

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,202
In this way we see the duality
of writing devices

32
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,937
That occurs in nature.

33
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,106
You just put that thing
together, just now.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,841
I'm giving you
a check minus.

35
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,311
Ah! Goddammit,
i hate check minus!

36
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,179
Sit down.

37
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,480
I'll make you
eat your parents.

38
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:21,347
What did you say?

39
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,180
Nothing.

40
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,349
All right, token,
you're next.

41
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,986
Using my laptop
i hooked into the internet

42
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,721
And found a meteorology
website.

43
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,988
I downloaded the data,

44
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,324
And with my dad's
video projector,

45
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,493
I can show you the graph i made
of predictable weather patterns

46
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,228
Over the next three months.

47
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,663
Ohh...

48
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,867
I also printed out the results
on my color printer.

49
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:42,133
Here you are,
miss choksondik.

50
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,771
Very, very good, token,
you get a check plus.

51
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:45,638
All right!

52
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:46,940
Oh, that is such
bullcrap!

53
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,074
Oh, eric, for the
love of god.

54
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,809
No, no, see, this is the
fundamental flaw

55
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,795
With the check, check plus,
check minus system.

56
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,747
The only reason token
was able to do all that

57
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,483
Is because his family
is rich.

58
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:57,350
My family isn't rich.

59
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,651
Oh, come on, token
your new house is

60
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,820
Four times the size
of anyone else's in town.

61
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,555
And who else gets crab cakes
and lobster tail

62
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,822
In their lunch boxes?

63
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,557
Your family is rich, dude. But i-

64
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,760
Let's just see where token's
clothes come from, shall we?

65
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,495
Ooh,armani exchange.

66
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,762
Armani exchange!

67
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,749
All the rest of us have to
buy our clothes atj-Mart.

68
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,701
Have you ever even been
inside a j-Mart, token?!

69
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,401
I didn't think so.

70
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah, dude,
your family's so rich

71
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,605
They have their own
pool table.

72
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,773
Yeah, and their own
sprinkler system.

73
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,509
You don't think
you're rich?

74
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,714
Hello, token, how was
school today?

75
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,466
Mom, dad, why do we have
a bigger house

76
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,184
Than everybody else
in south park?

77
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,220
Well, because we have
more money, son.

78
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,920
I know, but why?

79
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,907
Well, because we went
to graduate school

80
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,859
And therefore have more
lucrative jobs

81
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,161
Than most people in town.

82
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,896
For instance,
your mother is a chemist

83
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,197
For a pharmaceutical company,

84
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,366
Whereas your friend
eric cartman's mother

85
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,632
Is a crack whore.

86
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,968
One pays more
than the other.

87
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,486
Why, sweetie,
what's the matter?

88
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,913
All the kids
at school today

89
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:53,306
Made fun of me
because i'm rich.

90
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,572
Oh.

91
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,475
I don't wanna
be rich anymore.

92
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,210
I want to eat macaroni
and cheese for dinner

93
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,511
And wear clothes
from j-Mart.

94
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,379
J- Mart?!

95
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,079
Son, you don't know
what you're saying.

96
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,415
I just wanna be like all the
other kids in south park.

97
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,584
Please, mom and dad,
please!

98
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,127
You... sure you want
to do this, son?

99
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,428
I'm sure.

100
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,297
Hmm...

101
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,032
Where's the valet?

102
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,236
He must be parking
someone else's car.

103
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,502
Ah, here we go.

104
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,838
Take good care
of it, please.

105
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,007
Here's $20.

106
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,274
Ho!

107
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,911
They've activated some kind
of alien blinding device.

108
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:33,646
That's not a
blinding device, dad,

109
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,948
It's fluorescent
lighting.

110
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:35,815
Oh.

111
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,333
Excuse me, where
would we find

112
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,418
Young men's
fashion apparel?

113
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,587
Aisle 6, next to
the pretzels.

114
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:41,454
Next to the?

115
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,588
Come on!

116
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,659
Hey, look, these pants are
only five bucks apiece.

117
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,828
They must really suck.
What do you think?

118
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,363
What, what brand
are they?

119
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,782
It doesn't matter, mom.

120
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,166
They're poor people pants.

121
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,866
Hey, uh, sharon.

122
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,202
Isn't that
the williamses?

123
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,770
Huh?
Oh, yeah it is.

124
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,071
What are they doing here?

125
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,841
They can afford to shop
atcherry creek.

126
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,142
You see that, sheila,

127
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,877
The williamses
are shopping here.

128
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,144
I don't get it.

129
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,348
He must pull in
at least 200,000 a year.

130
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,192
Son, can you just
hurry it up?

131
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,193
I don't think we
quite fit in here.

132
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,831
Ooh, looks like you landed
on park avenue, stan.

133
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,000
You owe me $10 million.

134
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:27,832
Hey, guys.

135
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,602
Oh, hey, dude, did you
bring the movie?

136
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,868
I sure did.

137
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,170
Hey, you changed
your clothes, token.

138
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,940
Yeah well, y'know, i did a
little shopping at j-Mart.

139
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,675
All right, well, let's just
watch "the lion king".

140
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,976
Cartman's cheating
anyways.

141
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,278
Here you go.

142
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,544
What's that?

143
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,845
It's a d.V.D.
Of the lion king.

144
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,580
D.V.D.? We don't
own a d.V.D. Player.

145
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,350
Yeah, dude, nobody does,
they're too expensive.

146
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,387
Not too expensive for token's
rich-Ass family apparently.

147
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,989
Don't you have
a v.H.S. Of it?

148
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,689
I only have this.

149
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,026
Oh, well, let me take this
disk up to the "enterprise"

150
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,628
And see if "captain kirk"
can decrypt it.

151
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,164
What's a v.H.S.?

152
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,582
Oh, jesus, dude.

153
00:04:58,617 --> 00:04:59,931
Come on, guys,

154
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,701
We'll just have to find
other stuff to do.

155
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,002
Heh, "what's a v.H.S.?"

156
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,365
? Why can't i be like
all the other kids?

157
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,310
? They all have
three-Bedroom homes?

158
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:21,220
? Broken trucks
on their lawns?

159
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,089
? And cut up
hot dogs for lunch?

160
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,028
? It's not my fault
my parents succeed so much?

161
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,968
? There's no one in town
i can relate to?

162
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,404
? I play with autographed
baseball bats?

163
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,909
? While everyone else just plays
with sticks and pine cones?

164
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,680
? Has a boy ever
felt so alone?

165
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,850
? Well who needs
them anyway?

166
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,054
? I won't pretend
i'm something i'm not?

167
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,622
? If i can't be poor?

168
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,826
? I've got to deal
with what i've got?

169
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,428
? If i can't be like them?

170
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,465
? What i need is more
rich kids around?

171
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,598
? So i'm not
the only one?

172
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,236
? And then i won't
be so down?

173
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,309
? Please god
send more rich kids?

174
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,478
? To my town?

175
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,058
Ooh, look at this, honey.

176
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,696
A beautiful unspoiled
town in the rockies.

177
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,865
This is just what we've
been looking for.

178
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,600
Like aspen was
30 years ago.

179
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,901
Sounds nice.

180
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,504
We could buy hundreds of acres
of land for next to nothing.

181
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,071
And then i could finally
live like a cowboy.

182
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,275
Oh, will, the country would
be such a nicer place

183
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,541
To raise our kids.

184
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,878
Oh, kids!
Yes, daddy.

185
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,046
How would you like to move
to the colorado rockies?

186
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,148
The mountains,
daddy?

187
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,215
Can we have horses?

188
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,517
Oh, can we,
can we, daddy?

189
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,685
You bet!
Hooray!

190
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,493
Well, here it is,
our home to be.

191
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,627
Oh, will,
it's beautiful.

192
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,963
Hi, welcome to
the neighborhood.

193
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,265
Well, thank you,
young man.

194
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,367
We're the smiths.

195
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,434
Ah, a local boy.

196
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,301
You shall be
our new playmate.

197
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,567
I'm frederick.

198
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,904
This is my sister lisa
and my brother daniel.

199
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm token.

200
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,072
Our daddy is a
very famous actor.

201
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,590
What does your
daddy do?

202
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,675
Ah, he's a lawyer,
i think.

203
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,976
How quaint.

204
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,928
Kids, why don't you go
play with little token

205
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,447
While your mother and i
check out the town.

206
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:28,713
Very well,
come, local boy,

207
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,049
Show us how to play
your mountain games.

208
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,784
All right!

209
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,688
Thanks, god.

210
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,026
And this is the room
where my mom and dad

211
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,327
Keep their original
van gogh painting.

212
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,027
Yes, yes, we have
one of those, too.

213
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,363
In fact, we have seven
of them, i believe.

214
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,665
You do?
God, that's great!

215
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:46,931
Why?

216
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,484
I'm just so happy
you guys moved into town.

217
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,967
You see, i used to be
the only rich kid.

218
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,171
All the other families here are
kind of low to middle income.

219
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,906
Why, what happened to
all their money?

220
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,173
Well, they never really
had any money.

221
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,943
Well then, why don't their
daddies just act in a movie?

222
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,643
Well, i think that they-

223
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,413
Sometimes children must be
very firm with their daddies.

224
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:01,679
Indeed.

225
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,582
Like when daddy doesn't
want to act in a movie

226
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:03,883
Because he thinks
the script is bad.

227
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,149
So we must
plead with him.

228
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,486
"Please, daddy, please,
it's $20 million, daddy."

229
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:07,752
"Please, daddy,
please."

230
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,522
"20 million is still 12
million after taxes, daddy."

231
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,257
"I want a llama, daddy,
please, daddy!"

232
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,124
"Daddy, please!"

233
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,391
"Daddy!"

234
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,161
And so daddy
does the picture.

235
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,130
That's... great.

236
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,065
$20 million great.

237
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,800
? I found a girl
who had an innie?

238
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,101
? And i felt it
with my jimmy?

239
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,801
? Playa haters
try to dis me?

240
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,137
? 'Cause my rhymes
are just too...?

241
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,404
Sorry, snoop dogg,

242
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,174
But will smith is
on line 3 for you.

243
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,475
Oh.

244
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,210
William, how are you,
buddy?

245
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,512
Great, snoop dogg,
and you?

246
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:33,778
Couldn't be better.

247
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,114
I'm just laying down some
vocals for my new album.

248
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,380
Great, snoo-Snoo.

249
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,933
Listen, remember how we
always talked about

250
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:39,452
Wanting to buy property
up in the mountains

251
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,586
So our kids could
ski and ride horses?

252
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,789
Oh yes, the kids bug me
about it all the time.

253
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,091
Well, i found the place,
snooty roo.

254
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,260
It's in the rockies
but totally undiscovered,

255
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,795
Laid-Back and beautiful.

256
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,261
Oh, it sounds lovely!

257
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,562
You really should
come give it a look.

258
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,766
Jada and i would love for some
friends to move here with us.

259
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,032
I certainly will, william.

260
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,019
And perhaps i'll give ol'
magic and kobe bryant a call.

261
00:08:57,054 --> 00:08:58,971
They've been looking for
vacation properties as well.

262
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,238
Great!

263
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,574
Well, listen, let me let you
get back to your recording.

264
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,875
I'll see you soon, bye.

265
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,141
Bye.

266
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,647
All right let's take it
from the top, gang.

267
00:09:07,682 --> 00:09:09,382
? Shout "hell yeah"
from my vehicle?

268
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,117
? Living is a miracle?

269
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,721
Look, there's more ofthem
moving into our town.

270
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,323
Y'know, oprah winfrey is
building a house up on cannon,

271
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,262
And some snoop doggy doo doo
built a gigantic place on main.

272
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,997
Yep, there goes
the neighborhood.

273
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,600
That's the fifth family of them
that's moved here.

274
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,866
Seems like
all of a sudden

275
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,504
South park is being
overrun bythosetypes.

276
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,805
Hey, what are you
saying?

277
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,106
What types?

278
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,841
You know,thosetypes-

279
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,577
Rich people.

280
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,312
Oh.

281
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,914
I don't take kindly
to rich folk!

282
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,215
Neither does ned.

283
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,048
Nope.

284
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,349
I remember
back in the day

285
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,553
Rich folk weren't
allowed in south park.

286
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,253
Now they're moving here
in droves!

287
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,325
They're gonna be sending
their kids to our schools

288
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,927
And mixing them with our
pure, non-Rich kids.

289
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,627
Oh yeah,
and it won't be long

290
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,831
Before they drive all of us
poor, underachieving people

291
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,867
Out of town with inflated
real estate costs.

292
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,001
Damn, i hate them
stupid richers.

293
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,073
Yeah, hey, rich guy!
Hey, richie rich!

294
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,808
Yeah, i'm talking
to you, richer.

295
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,543
What's in the
huge box, richer,

296
00:10:10,578 --> 00:10:12,278
Your checkbook?

297
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,748
Yeah, how many
rich people does it take

298
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,483
To screw in a lightbulb?

299
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:18,749
None!

300
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,519
They can hire people
to do it for them!

301
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,219
Yeah, hey hey-

302
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,073
You guys know why richers
have such big garages?

303
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,893
'Cause they need a place
for all theirporsches

304
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,496
And boats and
aircraft carriers.

305
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,966
Yeah, that's right,
cash-Chucker.

306
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,569
Go have fun with your
$2 million house.

307
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,075
I guess we showed them.

308
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,810
A little to the left.

309
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,077
That's great.

310
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,148
And let's put another
pool over there.

311
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,414
Uh-Huh, good.

312
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,751
Token, these are oprah's
nearly-Adopted children,

313
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,052
Dominique and zizi.

314
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,371
Hello!
Hi.

315
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,620
Cheerio!

316
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,956
Ah, and these are
puff daddy's kids-

317
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,491
P. Diddy mini,
p. Poofy bite-Size

318
00:10:58,526 --> 00:10:59,992
And puffa diddy diddy
puff pun size.

319
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,161
Wow, my plan to get rich people
here sure did work.

320
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,462
Hey, i got a great idea!

321
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,197
Let's all pack some lunches
and go sledding.

322
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,499
Oh no, we're
going shopping.

323
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,016
Shopping! Shopping!

324
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:09,066
Yes, come, token.

325
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:09,969
We're all going to
head down to the mall

326
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,270
And buy some of
the stores.

327
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,439
Oh, all right then.

328
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,849
Excuse me, can we get
a couple beers over here?

329
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,753
They've got nice expensive beers
for you across the street

330
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,453
At the new wolfgang puck's.

331
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,958
That's all right, we just want
some nice cheap beer tonight.

332
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,127
Maybe you didn't see
the sign out front.

333
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,164
This bar is for people living
below their means only.

334
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,430
Yeah! Yeah!

335
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,332
This is a free country.

336
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,634
I can have a drink
wherever i want.

337
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:42,900
Come on, kobe,
let's just go.

338
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,538
This ain't over,
this ain't over by a long shot.

339
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,273
Oh, those richers
are getting snooty.

340
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,574
We've got to
show these richers

341
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,309
That they aren't
welcome here.

342
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,575
What do you mean?

343
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,213
How about tonight we sneak up
to one of their houses,

344
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,913
And right on their lawn,

345
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,984
We'll set fire to
a big lower case "t".

346
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,251
Lower case "t"?

347
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,021
Yeah for
"time to leave".

348
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,287
Yeah! Yeah!

349
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,588
Jimbo, you take some folk

350
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,323
And build a big, wooden
lower case "t".

351
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,527
I'll take the rest and get
some gas and torches ready.

352
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,262
All right! All right!

353
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,542
"T"?

354
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,746
T- Time to leave?

355
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,216
"T" is for time to leave,
cash-Chucker!

356
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,951
I'm calling the police.

357
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,651
I think
we scared him.

358
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,854
Yeah, next house
we'll do a capital "t",

359
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,023
To show them wereally
mean business!

360
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,290
Yeah! Yeah!

361
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,025
Now, token,
polo is very simple.

362
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,795
You simply must hit the
"williets" into "somesilion"?

363
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,061
With your "fragamenth".

364
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,362
Well yeah, but can't
we just play

365
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,566
Without wearing these
uncomfortable uniforms?

366
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,700
Can't we play without
the uniforms?

367
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,772
Yes, and let's eat caviar
without belinis as well.

368
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,073
Now come, token,
and remember,

369
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,773
It doesn't matter
who wins.

370
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,543
It the matter who wins
three times in a row.

371
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:58,375
Tallyho!

372
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,712
Tallyho! Tallyho!

373
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,544
Hooray!

374
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,182
Go frederick,
it's wonderful!

375
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,351
What in the hell
are they doing?

376
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,617
Is that fun?

377
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,953
I don't know, we don't have
horses so we can't play.

378
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,688
Well, let's just play
our game then.

379
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:10,955
All right.
I'll start.

380
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,291
I'll kick you
in the nuts, kenny!

381
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,557
Ooh!

382
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,761
I'll kick you
in the nuts, stan!

383
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,930
I'll kick you in
the nuts, cartman.

384
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,231
Ow!

385
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,171
You see, you must
pay attention, token.

386
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,473
I was able to "jollyrow"
your "davishmere"

387
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,208
With a "forecastle".

388
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,908
This game is
too confusing.

389
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,244
How about we have
a snowball fight?

390
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,413
A "snowball" fight?

391
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,113
How barbaric.

392
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,883
Yes, token, if you want to play
such savage games

393
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,052
I suggest you go
live with lions.

394
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,257
I don't fit in
anywhere.

395
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,627
Oh boy, we're going
to the zoo.

396
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,894
We can eat
jellopudding.

397
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,230
All right, this is
gonna be fun kids.

398
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,496
We're going to the zoo.

399
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,266
We can eat the jello pudding
and chocolate cake.

400
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,966
Hey, what are you doing?

401
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,953
If you're gonna ride
the bus in south park

402
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:59,905
You're gonna have to
sit in the front!

403
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,773
Yeah!
Yeah!

404
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,375
That's where the
first-Class seating is.

405
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,882
Yeah, how do you
like that, richer?

406
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,200
It's very nice
actually.

407
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:12,510
Yeah, i'll bet it is.

408
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:13,751
Very, very comfy.

409
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,738
Uh-Huh,
looks like it.

410
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,690
Hello, my name is token.

411
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,425
I don't fit in with all the kids
at south park elementary

412
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,594
So i invited a bunch of
rich kids to move to town.

413
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,196
The problem is, i don't
fit in with them either.

414
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,365
That's why i've come
to live with you.

415
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,269
So if you'll have me and
raise me one of your own

416
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,438
I promise to be the
best lion i can be!

417
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,174
Ahh, yeah.

418
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,944
? Shovel that snow, baby?

419
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,113
? It's all nice
heavy and wet?

420
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:41,981
? Just-?

421
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,800
? We shall persevere?

422
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:47,186
? We shall
persevere?

423
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,921
You there,
come march with us.

424
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,187
For what?

425
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,391
All the poor people in town
think they can persecute

426
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,126
And harass us
decent rich folk.

427
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,729
So we're uniting and marching
on the town square.

428
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:58,464
The million
millionaire march!

429
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,331
Yeah! Yeah!

430
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,849
Come on, brother.

431
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:01,934
But... i'm not rich.

432
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,200
What?

433
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,970
I'm just a school
cafeteria chef.

434
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,506
I don't make much money.

435
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,007
We'll give you $100.

436
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,609
Ooh, fudge the snow now.

437
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:13,663
? I shall persevere?

438
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,682
? We shall persevere?

439
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,434
Errr!

440
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:20,152
Yum yum.

441
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,321
Look at the little
black lion, mommy.

442
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,056
He's cute, isn't he?

443
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,430
Roar!

444
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,635
What are you
doing here, boy?

445
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,105
You, you talked.
I understood you.

446
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,274
I must be
becoming a lion.

447
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,974
You're not
becoming a lion.

448
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,612
The only way you can do
that is to see aslan.

449
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,746
Who's aslan?

450
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,383
Very well,
walk this way.

451
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,095
Is this the boy who's been
living in our realm?

452
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,361
Yes.

453
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,698
Are you aslan?

454
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,398
I am.

455
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,699
Well, i'm token.

456
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,204
So, you want to live with
the lions, do you?

457
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,639
Yes, umm, great aslan.

458
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,374
I don't fit in
anywhere else.

459
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,012
And what makes you think
you'd fit in with us?

460
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,764
Well, i don't know.

461
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,482
Do you like jokes?

462
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:24,350
What?

463
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,253
Jokes, you know,
funny, ha ha!

464
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,873
Us lions love jokes.

465
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,424
I like jokes a lot.

466
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,061
Hmm, then there may be
hope in you yet,

467
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,195
Young apprentice lion.

468
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,665
Very well, we will
let you stay.

469
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,604
If- You can pull this
thorn from my paw.

470
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,809
Go on, try it,
pull my thorn.

471
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,846
Come on,
pull my thorn!

472
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,521
So can i stay?

473
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,787
You may.

474
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,858
But being a lion may be
harder than you think.

475
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,478
A million millionaires
are gathering their ranks

476
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:12,064
And will be marching on
the town square tonight

477
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,799
In south park to
petition the end

478
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,402
Of separate bars, bus seating
and restaurants.

479
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,137
It looks like it will be
a great turnout

480
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,872
As some of the
millionaires also paid

481
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,908
Several thousand mexicans
to march for them.

482
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,511
If they get that petition passed
it's all over.

483
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,246
I guess we learned
our lesson.

484
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,848
You can't fight rich folk,
they're just too powerful.

485
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,017
Now, come on, is that
any way to talk?

486
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,283
They won, garrison,

487
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,054
They can't be
scared out of town.

488
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,090
No... we just haven't
scared them the right way.

489
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,356
Think about it.

490
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,560
What scares rich people
more than anything?

491
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,512
Ghosts?

492
00:17:43,547 --> 00:17:44,995
Bingo.

493
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,765
Rich people won't want
to live in south park

494
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,500
If they think
it's haunted.

495
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,767
Yeah! Yeah!

496
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,320
Everyone get some
sheets from home.

497
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:52,838
If we can't chase
the richers out,

498
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,157
We'll spook 'em out!

499
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,441
Yeah!
Let's go!

500
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,124
Aslan.

501
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,762
Yes, what is it, young
lion apprentice?

502
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,364
I think i'm gonna
go home now.

503
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,498
Home?

504
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,569
But i thought your friends
made fun of you at home.

505
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,571
They do, but i guess
i learned something today.

506
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,209
You see, even though kids at
south park make fun of me

507
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,961
I still like
hanging around them

508
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:33,705
More than snobby rich kids
or lions.

509
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,414
Even though i may be
different from them

510
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,600
I still like my
old friends best.

511
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,751
It sounds like you've
learned much,

512
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,920
Young lion apprentice.

513
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,187
Very well.

514
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,355
But before you go

515
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,427
Perhaps you would like
a stick of gum?

516
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,561
No thanks.

517
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,163
Go on, it's spearmint.

518
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,465
No, because there's
a spring in there.

519
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,235
And if i pull the gum out
it's gonna hurt my finger.

520
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,705
Ohh, so you don't
want any gum then?

521
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,741
Are you sure?

522
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:05,344
Go on, try it!

523
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,645
Ow.

524
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,416
Oh, that is
good stuff!

525
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,055
Jesus, lions suck.

526
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,189
And so it is with
great determination

527
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,827
That us decent rich americans
have gathered to say

528
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,996
We will be
separated no more.

529
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,262
Hooray! Hooray!

530
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,032
This certainly has been
an enlightening evening.

531
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,418
And as mayor
i accept your petition

532
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,370
And will abolish
all separation laws.

533
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,636
Yeah! Yeah!

534
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,805
And i want to assure
the nation that is watching

535
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,876
That south park is not a town
of prejudice or bigotry.

536
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,611
Woo... woo...

537
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,797
Boo!

538
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,914
Boo!

539
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,083
Boo!

540
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:46,985
What the?

541
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,287
Oh god, no.

542
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,388
Boo!

543
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,420
Haa!

544
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,757
Karl, do you see
what i see?

545
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,023
Yes, martin.

546
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,227
I do believe this town
is "hainted".

547
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,493
Boo!

548
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,662
Kids, go find the
limo and get in!

549
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,432
You didn't tell me
this town was hainted.

550
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,698
I didn't know!

551
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,336
I! Didn't! Know!

552
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,205
It's working.

553
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,541
They're scared
to death.

554
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,276
Pack up your
things quickly,

555
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,578
We gotta
get out of here.

556
00:20:12,613 --> 00:20:14,711
Boo!

557
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,481
Oh, hey, there's token.

00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:17,748

Dude, just because we rip

565
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,627

For now on, i'm fine with being
made fun of for being rich.

583
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,785
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on
you for being rich anymore.

584
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,052
You're not?

585
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,605
No, dude, because since you
got your feelings so hurt

586
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,123

That was it.

594
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,871
We just saw the last of 'em
speeding away in a van.

595
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,172
All right! All right!

596
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,775
They were so scared, i'm sure
they'll never be back.

597
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,041
That's great!

598
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,679
Now we can sell all their homes
and become millionaires!

599
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,379
What?

600
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,583
But then you had us do
all that for nothing.

601
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,849
Don't you see?

602
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,185
If you get rich
selling these homes

603
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,354
Then there will still be
rich people in south park.

604
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,391
Yeah, you'd become
what you hate.

605
