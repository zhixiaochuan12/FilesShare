? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,433
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:18,960

00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,164
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,070
Okay, carol,
put the card you picked

15
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:40,239
Back into the deck
so i can't see it.

16
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,541
What's going on?

17
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:44,143
This fellow, david blaine,
he's doing magic tricks.

18
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,843
Hey, where'd you get
that ice cream?

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,613
Okay, now hold this card
up to the crowd.

20
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:48,915
Was that the card
you picked?

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,782
No, i'm sorry,

22
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,300
I picked
the four of hearts.

23
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:52,385
Four of hearts,
really?

24
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:53,252
Look again.

25
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,519
Aah!

26
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,254
Whoa!

27
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,156
That's pretty cool, dude.

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,856
Who's this asshole?

29
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,626
He's a magician named david
blaine, dude, he kicks ass.

30
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,928
Where'd you guys
get that ice cream?

31
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,229
Sir, could you
come over here?

32
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:04,964
Now, what i want you
to do, mr.-

33
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,265
Kern.

34
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,434
Mr. Kern, i want you to
just think about a card.

35
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,037
Pick any card and
picture it in your mind.

36
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,303
Okay.

37
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,507
Okay, just, just think
about your card.

38
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,109
Okay, look at me.

39
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:20,146
Look at me.

40
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,846
Look at me.

41
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,182
Okay, now reach
up your ass.

42
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,448
Huh?

43
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,652
Go on,
reach up your ass.

44
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,821
I don't
feel nothing.

45
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:29,654
Deeper.

46
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,424
I don't feel-

47
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,558
Wait, wait.

48
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,328
Was that the card
you picked?

49
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,629
Yes,
oh my god!

50
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:37,895
Oh ho!

51
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,798
Wow, that's cool.

52
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:39,665
How'd he do that?

53
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,967
Thank you.

54
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,135
I've been traveling from
town to town for quite a while.

55
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,835
I've started
quite a following

56
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,907
Mostly because of
my levitation trick.

57
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,377
Watch.

58
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,378
Oh!

59
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,113
No way!

60
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,317
Damn, that guy is the
coolest guy in the universe.

61
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,584
Pamphlet, pamphlet!

62
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,354
Here you go, kids,
take a pamphlet.

63
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,620
"David blaine workshop."

64
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,257
"Learn all about david blaine
at the center for magic."

65
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,559
Dude, we gotta go.

66
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,595
Yeah, they probably teach you
how to do magic tricks!

67
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,764
Hello everyone.

68
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,030
My name is steven,

69
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,199
And i've been a blainetologist
for about three years.

70
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,837
So when david blaine performed
his miracles out on the street,

71
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,006
What moved you the most?

72
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,272
His miracles?

73
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,777
Oh yes, you see, david blaine
is much more than a magician.

74
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,746
He's a scholar, a visionary,
a leader.

75
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,681
When are we gonna
learn magic tricks?

76
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:29,513
Yeah.

77
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:30,850
Oh, i've got a trick
for you to learn.

78
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,886
I can show you how to make
your true self appear.

79
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,586
Let me ask you all
something.

80
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,091
Do you consider yourselves
to be happy?

81
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,358
I don't think
i'm very happy.

82
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,863
I always fall asleep to the
sound of my own screams.

83
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:45,563
Right.

84
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,298
See, the reason that
you are-

85
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,068
And then i always get
woken up in the morning

86
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,803
By the sound of
my own screams.

87
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,104
Do you think
i'm unhappy?

88
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,106
The, thepointis,
that you can be happy.

89
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,309
You see, your friends and
parents have programmed you

90
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,877
In a way that makes you feel
isolated and alone.

91
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:04,684
How many times have you felt
like nobody knows the real you?

92
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,384
You're not really happy.

93
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,685
I'm not really happy.

94
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,854
Your potential hasn't
even been reached.

95
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,589
My potential hasn't
even been reached.

96
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,793
If you look through
david blaine's incredible book,

97
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:15,493
You'll find a lot of
life's answers.

98
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,829
Let's read some of the book
together, shall we?

99
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,998
Then we get to be in
david blaine's secret club?

100
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,167
That's right.
Cool.

101
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,203
Ike, eat your
gefilte fish.

102
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,071
No.

103
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:26,771
Mom, mom,
i found out all about

104
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,541
This great new magician
named david blaine.

105
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:30,276
That's nice kyle,
ike, eat!

106
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,542
We spent all afternoon

107
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,529
Learning about how we
aren't actually happy.

108
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,481
I had no idea how unhappy
i was until today.

109
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,782
They gave me
this school book to read

110
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,482
And i'm already
on chapter four.

111
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:40,252
Well, it's nice to see you so
interested in something, kyle.

112
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,421
Ike, for the love of abraham,
you are gonna eat this!

113
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,723
So, can i go
to the magic camp

114
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,458
To learn how to become
a full member?

115
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,759
All the other guys
are doing it.

116
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,060
And it's only $69.95.

117
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,326
Magic camp?

118
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,663
I don't know, booby,
ask your father.

119
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,265
Ike, you will eat this!

120
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,037
Prepare to be cleansed and
release the magic inside you.

121
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,604
I am prepared.

122
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,110
Huh, geez,
it sure got cold in here.

123
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,810
Next.

124
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,013
Congratulations,
young blainetologists.

125
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:10,581
From this day,
you are clean.

126
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,750
Now, we have
very important work to do.

127
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,387
David blaine is going to
put on a big magic show

128
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,654
In denver
tomorrow night.

129
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,725
Where he's going to eat
his own head.

130
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,593
Wow!

131
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,761
So it's up to all you new
blainetologists

132
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,497
To get as many
people there as you can.

133
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,932
Whoever gets the most people
to come, gets a prize.

134
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,003
Kyle, i'm starting to think
that this is a really bad idea.

135
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,304
Hey, i'm not kyle,
i'm butters.

136
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,172
I thought
you were kyle.

137
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,438
No, i'm stan.

138
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:34,907
You're stan?
Where's kenny?

139
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,607
Who are you?
I'm kyle.

140
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,377
Heh heh, guess who
i am, you guys.

141
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,546
Kyle, i think we may have
gotten into something bad here.

142
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,378
What do you mean?

143
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,715
We're learning
all kinds of cool stuff.

144
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,981
Look at us, dude.

145
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,317
These people are trying
to change us somehow.

146
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,451
I think it's time
we went home.

147
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,221
But david blaine is going to do
more miracles in denver tomorrow.

148
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,390
I don't care,
i'm leaving!

149
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:53,958
Excuse me.

150
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,860
Where are
you going?

151
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,127
I'm going home.

152
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,428
You don't want
to go home.

153
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,632
You said we're free to
leave whenever we want.

154
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,499
You are.

155
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,801
Then move
out of the way.

156
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,102
I'm not in your way.

157
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:03,969
You are.

158
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,138
Are you unhappy with
the church's teachings?

159
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,838
Let's just talk about it.

160
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,007
I don't wanna talk about it,
i just wanna leave.

161
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:13,078
Why don't we go into the back
room for a second and talk,

162
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,345
Then you can leave.

163
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,115
That's okay,
i changed my mind.

164
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,650
I'm gonna stay.

165
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,151
That's great news.

166
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:23,488
Okay, it's all clear.

167
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,321
What are we doing?

168
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,623
We're getting out of here.

169
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,959
This whole thing has
gotten way out of hand.

170
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,260
Whoa, whoa,
i'm not going anywhere.

171
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,128
Come on kyle,
this is stupid.

172
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,429
It's not stupid, stan.

173
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,598
For once in my life, i feel
like i'm part of something.

174
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,864
A part of what?

175
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:35,201
Some gay-Wad magician's
crazy life plan?

176
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,502
Don't call mr. Blaine
a "gay wad",

177
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,768
He's a brilliant man.

178
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,538
No, they just convinced you
that he's a brilliant man!

179
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,805
Let's go!
Going anywhere.

180
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,141
Goddamn it,
i'm not going with you!

181
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:42,973
I wanna stay here!

182
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,310
Huh? I thought you
wanted to leave.

183
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,611
Oh wait,
who am i again?

184
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,443
You're stan.

185
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,780
Oh yeah -
God damn it-

186
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,046
Hold on a second.

187
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,382
Okay, look dude,
i'm getting out of here.

188
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,117
And you're a dumb ass
if you don't come with me.

189
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,720
Then i guess
i'm a dumb ass.

190
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,155
Kyle, please.

191
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,625
You-You're
my best friend.

192
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,263
Well, this is what
i believe in now, stan,

193
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,963
And if you can't
respect that,

194
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,468
Then i guess we're not
best friends anymore.

195
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:20,978
Hello ma'am.

196
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,713
My name is kyle
and this is cartman.

197
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,917
We'd like to share our interest
in david blaine with you.

198
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,953
Uh-Oh, my husband warned me
about you "blaine-Iacs".

199
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,688
I'm sorry,
but i'm a catholic.

200
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,423
It doesn't
matter, ma'am.

201
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,725
Blainetology
is for everyone.

202
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,894
There are blainetologists
who are catholic, buddhist,

203
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,629
Why, even kyle here
is a god damn jew.

204
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,895
That's right.

205
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,231
So you're not a cult?

206
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,931
A cult, no.

207
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,666
David blaine
is a real person.

208
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,304
You may have seen his
television specials onabc.

209
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,570
He also wrote a book

210
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:47,473
And we'd like
to share it with you.

211
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,208
Well, all right,
come on in.

212
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,474
Okay.

213
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,643
And if you look here,
you can see how david blaine

214
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,847
Performed the miracle of being
frozen in ice at times square.

215
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,113
Ma'am, have you
ever wondered

216
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,883
What david blaine's
plan is for you?

217
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,149
No, not really.

218
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,885
Hey, you see,
that's interesting,

219
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,620
Because i'm so thankful for
david blaine's book.

220
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,257
And i'm so thankful that he showed
me the way to true happiness.

221
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,957
But i think
about his plan often-

222
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,294
David blaine is doing
a big performance

223
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:09,994
In denver
tomorrow night.

224
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,330
We're sure his magic
will entertain and astound you.

225
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,631
He's going to eat
his own head.

226
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,366
How many tickets
can we put you down for?

227
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,633
Oh, i can't go.

228
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,403
Oh, come on, it will
make you a happy person.

229
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,071
I am happy.

230
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:18,704
No, you're not.

231
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,536
Yes, i am.

232
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,222
No, you're not.

233
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:20,873
I really am.

234
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:21,740
No, you're not.

235
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,573
But i am.

236
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,007
No, you're not.

237
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:23,909
All right,
two tickets.

238
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:24,777
Great.

239
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,477
That's 15 people
we got to agree

240
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,030
To come see david blaine
perform in denver.

241
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,548
Yes, brother kyle,
but our work is not over.

242
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,717
We must still recruit
ten more audience members

243
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,549
In order to get
the prize.

244
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,886
I think if we try
kenny's neighborhood,

245
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,453
We might find that-

246
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,959
Come brother kyle,
we have no time for him.

247
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:54,672
Aah!

248
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,177
You better watch yourself
next time, abandoner!

249
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,046
Hi jesus, it's me-

250
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,347
Stan marsh.
Stan marsh.

251
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,117
Of course, i know you,
my child, come in.

252
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,852
This guy is going around,
doing magic tricks

253
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,153
And saying
they're miracles.

254
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,420
My friend kyle thinks
he's totally awesome.

255
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,190
You are good to bring this
to my attention, stan.

256
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,890
Cults are a very
dangerous thing.

257
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,059
I read in the bible that
you perform miracles too.

258
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,262
If you could go in front of
these people and do your miracles,

259
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,396
They'll all see that
david blaine isn't so special.

260
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,034
The miracle i'm most famous for
is turning water into wine.

261
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,300
Can you do it again?

262
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,504
Very well,
i shall perform the miracle.

263
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,673
Behold, here you can see
ordinary water.

264
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:28,939
Clear, clean.

265
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:31,576
Okay, now turn around.

266
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,179
Turn-Turn around.

267
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,649
Okay, now turn back.

268
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,035
It is now wine!

269
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,952
That's it?

270
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,288
That's how you did
that trick?

271
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,555
Well, yeah.

272
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,724
That trick
sucks, jesus.

273
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,795
Oh, i guess it worked a little
better on people 2,000 years ago.

274
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,061
Dude, we have
to do something.

275
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,831
This guy is performing more
miracles in denver tonight.

276
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,133
He's gonna get
more followers

277
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,434
And it will be impossible
for me to get kyle out.

278
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,700
Then let's go.

279
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,037
But dude, i don't think
you should do

280
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,338
That lame
water to wine trick.

281
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,604
Oh, don't worry.

282
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,808
I have a few more
miracles up my sleeve.

283
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,844
This is a really
good turnout.

284
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,579
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

285
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,314
David blaine!

286
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,316
Hello, my children.

287
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
may we have silence please

288
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,725
As magician david blaine
will now eat his own head.

289
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,172
Dude, no way.

290
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,077
Thank you, everyone.

291
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,246
Our organization
grows larger every day.

292
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,016
Soon the government will
even have to give us

293
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,618
Tax-Exempt status as
a bona fide religion.

294
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:47,486
Hold!

295
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,186
It's jesus!

296
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,522
What's he doing here?

297
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:51,789
My children

298
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,524
It is time for you
to go home

299
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,692
And stop following
this false prophet.

300
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,330
You should be using your money
and time for other things.

301
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,065
These are simple
magic tricks.

302
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,765
His magic
is interesting,

303
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,102
But will it put food
on your table?

304
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:06,537
Feeding the hungry-
Now,thatis a miracle.

305
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,042
Behold, i have here five loaves
of bread and three fish,

306
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,211
Certainly not enough to feed
this entire crowd.

307
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:15,681
But now, turn around.

308
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,283
Turn around.

309
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,790
Okay,
now turn back.

310
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,995
Now, how the hell
did he do that?

311
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,731
Wow!

312
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,935
Your magic is old
and outdated, jesus.

313
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,237
Just like you are.

314
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,503
Oh, really?

315
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,574
Then what's this ace of spades
doing behind your ear?

316
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,153
Jesus christ!

317
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,455
He's incredible.

318
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,589
The old religions
have failed you.

319
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:02,528
What have they offered except
for war, poverty and sadness?

320
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,130
Blainetology offers you
the key to living your life

321
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,449
To the fullest.

322
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:07,733
Will you join us?

323
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,433
Yes!

324
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,986
His magic is
too powerful, stanley.

325
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,504
I've never seen
anything like it.

326
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,239
Then, what are
we gonna do?

327
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,506
I cannot
face him alone.

328
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,143
We must get the help of
all the super best friends.

329
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,444
Buddha!
Buddha, come in!

330
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,312
Super best friends?

331
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,047
This is buddha, jesus,
go ahead.

332
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,313
Buddha, we may
have a problem.

333
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,517
I've just encountered a magic
i've never seen before.

334
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,252
I'll call
everyone together.

335
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,519
Come as fast as you can.

336
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,156
Come stanley,
we must travel far and long.

337
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:31,989
To where?

338
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,193
Distances unfathomable
to man.

339
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:36,361
Yea, take hold
of my robe, stanley.

340
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,096
And do not open your eyes.

341
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,796
I am ready.

342
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,567
Are you still keeping
your eyes closed?

343
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:42,833
Yeah.

344
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,470
Good, want
some peanuts?

345
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,604
Congratulations, sister.

346
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,157
You have learned
the noble truth

347
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,676
And are now
a blainetologist.

348
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:51,942
Everyone!

349
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,844
Everyone gather around.

350
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,013
I have great news for all
blainetologists

351
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,713
And for our new
members as well.

352
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,917
We've just gotten word
from mr. Blaine himself.

353
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,520
The government has denied
our church's request

354
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,255
For tax-Exempt status!

355
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,424
But, we want
tax-Exempt status.

356
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,159
Yeah, why is that
good news?

357
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,859
Because-

358
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,496
Mr. Blaine has arranged for
all blainetologist members

359
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,099
From every city and state to
march into washington

360
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,702
And demand our right for
tax-Exempt status

361
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,304
By committing a mass suicide!

362
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,004
Mass suicide?

363
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,075
Mr. Blaine has said that by
killing ourselves in washington,

364
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,112
We are guaranteed everlasting
happiness in the afterlife.

365
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,883
Get your things ready,
we leave for washington at dawn.

366
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,835
Did you hear
that, guys?

367
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,354
We're finally gonna die!

368
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,693
All right, stanley,
you can open your eyes now.

369
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,547
This is the hall of the
super best friends, stanley.

370
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:48,367
The headquarters for those
who stand for what's right.

371
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,934
Jesus!

372
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,138
We've been working hard
since we got your distress call.

373
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,404
Who da kid?

374
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,042
Stanley, i want you to meet
some of the super best friends.

375
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,176
Buddha, with the powers
of invisibility.

376
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,247
Mohammed, the muslim prophet
with the powers of flame.

377
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,947
Krishna, the hindu diety.

378
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,717
Joseph smith,
the mormon prophet.

379
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,417
Lao-Tzu,
the founder of taoism.

380
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:10,055
And seaman, with the ability
to breathe underwater

381
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,590
And link mentally
with fish.

382
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,056
So you mean to
tell me that

383
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,260
Even though people fight
over different religions,

384
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,394
You guys are
actually friends?

385
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,465
More than friends, young boy,
we are super best friends!

386
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,599
With the desire
to fight for justice.

387
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,803
We all believe in the power
of good over evil.

388
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,503
Except for buddha,
of course,

389
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,273
He doesn't really
believe in evil.

390
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,539
Wow.

391
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:31,309
Jesus, come look
at this.

392
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,045
After your distress call,

393
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:35,647
We entered david blaine into
the super best friends computer.

394
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,382
Many interesting things
showed up.

395
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,985
He was raised in new york city
by a decent family.

396
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,154
But a freak washing machine
accident at the age of 12

397
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,756
Made him learn the ways
of the black arts.

398
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,058
That's right, semen.

399
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,625
Sea-Man.

400
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,395
That's what
i said, semen!

401
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,865
Stop it!

402
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,734
Cartman.

403
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,504
Cartman,
wake up.

404
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,771
Cartman.

405
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,107
No, paula poundstone
leave me alone!

406
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,807
It's just me.

407
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,445
Brother kyle,
why do you disturb my rest?

408
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:09,047
Dude, i don't think i want
to be part of this anymore.

409
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,314
What?

410
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,650
I think stan
might have been right.

411
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,916
Anyway, i think
it's going too far.

412
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,987
I mean, if i kill myself, it's
gonna make my family really sad.

413
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,523
Yeah, i know
what you mean.

414
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,024
I don't want
to die either.

415
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,759
I haven't even got
my pubes yet.

416
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,494
I think we should bail.

417
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:23,760
If we leave the group,

418
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,964
Maybe other people will get
the courage to leave, too.

419
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,699
That could be difficult,
brother kyle.

420
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,833
But all right, listen.

421
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,134
Why don't
we sleep on it?

422
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,471
If we decide
to leave the faction,

423
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:33,772
We can do it
in the morning.

424
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,038
Okay.

425
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,025
Okay, you're right.

426
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,977
Oh, cartman... thanks.

427
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,219
Cartman?

428
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,821
What the hell?

429
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,508
? I told on you?

430
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,991
? I told on you?

431
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,293
What have
you done, cartman?

432
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,497
This is for your own good,
brother kyle.

433
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,249
You must understand,
brother kyle.

434
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,967
You know too much
about the church.

435
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,003
If you left now, you'd become
a danger to our cause.

436
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,703
And you know
what else kyle said?

437
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:10,208
Kyle, he said that if we were
all going to commit suicide

438
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,908
That he wouldn't do it.

439
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,210
Cartman, you
fat ass tattletale!

440
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,414
At least i'm not the boy
in the plastic bubble.

441
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,582
The suicide pact will go
as planned.

442
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,052
If we die,
we all die together.

443
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,691
Meanwhile, at the hall
of super best friends...

444
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,392
Look at that, jesus.

445
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,595
His followers are growing at
a rate even faster than mine.

446
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,131
It appears this david blaine
is as dangerous

447
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,632
As you and your young
friend had feared.

448
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,332
I knew it.

449
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,102
Here, i have a videotape of his
performance the other night.

450
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,271
Perhaps we should have
moses look at the tape

451
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,572
And see what he
comes up with.

452
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,873
Moses, scan this tape.

453
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,042
Can you tell us the source
of blaine's power?

454
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,645
Give me
the information.

455
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,779
Wow,themoses.

456
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,514
His magic is
a combination of

457
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,585
Centrifugal alignment
and slight of hand,

458
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,851
Wait a minute.

459
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:56,153
I'm picking up movement

460
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,573
From blainetologists
all over the country.

461
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,959
The blainetologists
are heading to washington.

462
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,225
But why?

463
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,527
Wait a minute.

464
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,297
At his performance,
david blaine said something

465
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,032
About trying to
get tax-Exempt status.

466
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,298
Oh my god!
What?

467
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,634
If he gets
tax-Exempt status,

468
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,803
Then he'll become
a real religion.

469
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,371
He would become
unstoppable.

470
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,973
Meanwhile, in
the nation's capital,

471
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,394
Blainetologists from
all over the country

472
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,745
Have gathered
to commit mass suicide.

473
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,781
If the government will not give
us tax-Exempt status,

474
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:27,853
Then we must prove that we are
willing to die for our beliefs.

475
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,420
All right, brothers and sisters,
gather around.

476
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,057
It's time to drown ourselves
in the reflecting pool.

477
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,660
However, the reflecting pool
is a little more shallow

478
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,360
Than we originally thought.

479
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,564
So to drown ourselves, you will
need to lie on your stomach,

480
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,167
Face down, until you die,
as such.

481
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,975
Next!

482
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,143
Meanwhile,
at the white house...

483
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,963
Mr. President, we can't let
them all kill themselves.

484
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:57,349
But we can't give them
tax-Exempt status either, carl.

485
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,049
Hey george,
what's going on?

486
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,469
All right brother kyle,
it is time for us to die.

487
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,855
Cartman, we've been
brainwashed, don't you see?

488
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,121
We don't have to do this.

489
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,892
But it's the only way
for us to be happy!

490
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:07,759
Cartman, no!

491
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,066
Give us what we want or
we will continue to die.

492
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,801
Not so fast,
david blaine.

493
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:18,502
Jesus! Not again.

494
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,139
Yes, but this time,
i've brought some help.

495
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,839
Super best friends, ho!

496
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:23,958
Buddha! Mohammed! John smith!

497
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,043
Krishna!
Lao-Tzu! Seaman!

498
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,513
The mass suicide is over,
blaine, and so are you.

499
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,381
I don't think so.

500
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,699
Get them!

501
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:31,983
Aah!

502
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,586
Ice breath should
take care of you.

503
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,755
Kyle, kyle!

504
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:39,357
Sweet salvation!

505
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,827
Kyle!?

506
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,466
Oh my god,
they killed kenny!

507
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,635
You bastards!

508
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,902
Kyle?

509
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,238
Oh my god,
they killed kenny!

510
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,372
You bastard!

511
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,009
Oh my god,
they killed kenny!

512
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:58,877
That takes care
of them.

513
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,577
Now it's your
turn, blaine.

514
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:04,516
Perhaps you need to see
some real magic.

515
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,120
Raaaaarh!

516
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,890
Oh, this looks
like trouble.

517
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,625
So long,
super bestfools!

518
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,891
Kyle!
Stan!

519
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,227
Kyle, you can't
kill yourself.

520
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,494
I don't want
to kill myself.

521
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,698
They rigged this thing
to fill with water.

522
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,035
We've got to stop that
oversized abraham lincoln.

523
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,903
Mohammed!

524
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,939
Aah!

525
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,240
Great scott!

526
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,578
Okay, try again.

527
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,783
It is too
powerful, jesus.

528
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,483
It seems to have
no weakness.

529
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,253
There has to be a way
to destroy it.

530
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,520
Jesus to moses.

531
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,157
Meanwhile, at the
super best friends league...

532
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,459
Come in, moses.

533
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,725
What?

534
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,664
We need to know how to kill
a giant stone abraham lincoln.

535
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,798
Umm...

536
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,400
Wait a minute,
ummm...

537
00:18:57,435 --> 00:19:00,472
A giant stone
john wilkes booth?

538
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,376
You heard him,
super best friends.

539
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,412
We've got to make a giant stone
john wilkes booth.

540
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,581
Krishna, we're going to
need wood for a mold.

541
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,183
Form of a beaver.

542
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,955
I will find sources
of concrete.

543
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,557
You- Get the water
to mix it with,semen.

544
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,993
Using the wood that krishna
cut down as a beaver,

545
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,931
Jesus uses his master carpentry
skills to make a giant mold.

546
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,233
That should
do the trick.

547
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,933
Now for some concrete.

548
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,137
Meanwhile,
in the ocean depths,

549
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,173
Semen seeks out water
to mix with the concrete.

550
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,873
Sea-Man!

551
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:38,174
Look, swallow,

552
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,944
We should be able to divert
the water with that pipe.

553
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:43,848
And so, seaman and swallow
get to- Get to work.

554
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,451
Kyle, you have to
hold your breath.

555
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,693
Oh, very funny.

556
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,765
Lao-Tzu, bring it to life.

557
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,500
Using his power of taoism,

558
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:07,272
Lao-Tzu becomes one with the
giant stone john wilkes booth.

559
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,876
Ah!

560
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,611
It worked.

561
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,116
Now freeze over the pool so no
one else can drown themselves.

562
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,852
Hey, i was just
about to do it.

563
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,490
Later, at the
exact same location...

564
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,190
Damn you,
super best friends.

565
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,261
Your magic is no match for
our powers combined, blaine.

566
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:33,298
Then i guess you win this time,
super best fools.

567
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,033
But i'll be back.

568
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,069
Goddamn it!

569
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:38,902
It's all right.

570
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,672
Everything is
as it should be.

571
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,841
Shut up, buddha.

572
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:44,358
Our leader, he's-

573
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,443
He's leaving us!

574
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,612
Don't leave us,
david blaine.

575
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,913
Listen up, everyone.

576
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,516
You don't need david blaine
to tell you how to live.

577
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,685
See, cults are dangerous
because they promise you hope,

578
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,654
Happiness and maybe even
an afterlife.

579
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,289
But in return, they demand
you pay money.

580
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,890
Any religion that
requires you to pay money

581
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,458
In order to move up and
learn its tenets is wrong.

582
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,661
You see, all religions have
something valuable to teach.

583
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,830
But just like
the super best friends learned,

584
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,433
It requires a little bit
of them all.

585
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,168
He's right.

586
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,868
He's right!

587
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,421
Thanks for
saving us, stan.

588
00:21:13,456 --> 00:21:14,904
You'remysuper
best friend.

589
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,241
You're my super best
friend too, kyle.

590
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,374
Oh, that's so sweet,
you guys.

591
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,012
You want to go get a room so
you can make out for a while?

592
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,313
Heh-Heh.

593
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,146
Ow!

594
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,482
Ow, stop it!

595
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,050
Well, it looks like
everything worked out.

596
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,555
And so jesus and his companions
leave washington.

597
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,689
But their return is assured,

598
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,893
For there will always
be a need for...
