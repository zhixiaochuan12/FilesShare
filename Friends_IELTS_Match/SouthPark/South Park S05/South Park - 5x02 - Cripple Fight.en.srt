00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,302
Well, you boys must
be pretty excited-

15
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,603
Your first night
of scouts.

16
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,905
It's gonna suck.

17
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:40,640
There's gonna be all these
new kids there we don't know.

18
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:41,906
Yeah.

19
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,641
Well, now, that's
part of the fun.

20
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,411
Yeah, both kenny's dad and
i were in scouts for years.

21
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,712
Was your dad
in scouts, cartman?

22
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:48,014
Oh yeah, you don't
have a dad.

23
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,449
That's not funny!
Jesus christ!

24
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,653
Are you excited for your first
night of scouts, timmy?

25
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,220
Yeah, timmy!

26
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:57,990
Yeah,
he's excited.

27
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:03,629
Hey, fellas.

28
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:04,896
Hey, butters.

29
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,197
Boy, am i glad
to see you guys.

30
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,533
There's lots of kids here
from other schools.

31
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,834
I don't know anybody.

32
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,570
All right boys, we're
gonna head to the bar.

33
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:11,871
We'll be back to
pick you up at nine.

34
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,040
You boys just make sure to
obey the scout leader now.

35
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,341
He's the man in charge.

36
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,076
Hello, scouts!

37
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,210
Hey, it's
big gay al!

38
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,379
Hello, stanley,
i was happy to see you

39
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,149
And your little friends'
names on the list.

40
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,415
Timmy!

41
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,968
You're the new
scout leader?

42
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,451
I just got
transferred in.

43
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,655
I think everyone's here now,
so we can get started.

44
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,824
Come on, scouts,
we've got work to do.

45
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,427
Hooray! Hooray! See ya, dad.

46
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:37,463
Hey, are you parents gonna
stand there all night?

47
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:41,367
This meeting is for scouts only,
you silly gooses!

48
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,271
Now, before we get
started, scouts,

49
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,307
I want to introduce you to
someone very special here tonight.

50
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,441
He's a brave little boy
with disabilities,

51
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:53,946
Who proves just by being here
that scouts are for everyone!

52
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,212
Timmy!

53
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,549
So let's all all give a big
round of applause

54
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,249
To little jimmy!

55
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,453
Well, hello,
everyone.

56
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,790
Ji-Jimmy?

57
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,996
Look, i'm not saying the new
scout leader's a bad person,

58
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:12,182
I just don't think he
should be a scout leader.

59
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,333
He got to where he is
by being a good scout,

60
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,635
Maybe we should just
leave him alone.

61
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,936
Well, how gay
is he?

62
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,671
He's really,
really gay.

63
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,840
Well then, i don't want
my boy there either.

64
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,540
So, he's a
homosexual, so what?

65
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,744
I have nothing against
homosexuals either, randy,

66
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,444
But the big camping trip
is next week.

67
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,081
Are you saying you're fine with
this guy camping overnight,

68
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,781
Alone, with our boys?

69
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:32,551
You know, boys emulate
authority figures.

70
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,720
Even if it doesn't
turn them gay,

71
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,455
They can end up all
talking all fem'

72
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,190
And prancing around
like girls.

73
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,943
Ah, that's
ridiculous.

74
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:41,626
People,
people, please!

75
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,263
You're forgetting that
homosexuality is a choice.

76
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:49,035
As many of you know, i myself
went through a homosexual phase.

77
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,637
But the light of christ
showed me how to change.

78
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,938
Just give me two hours
with this man

79
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,240
And i can
convert him back.

80
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,374
That's what you said
about peterson,

81
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,577
And then you ended up
having sex with him.

82
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,277
That's right, you did.

83
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,915
And so, that's how to make
banana nut muffins.

84
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,301
And now, as a very
special treat,

85
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:07,218
Our very
special friend jimmy

86
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,554
Is going to do
what he loves most-

87
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,306
Motivational
stand-Up comedy.

88
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,024
Let's give him
a big hand!

89
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,026
Wow, what a great
audience.

90
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,362
Well, just in case
you were wondering,

91
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,062
I do have
a disability-

92
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,266
I am totally happy with the way
i was born, very much.

93
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,001
I travel to different states
and talk to kids

94
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,701
About being proud
of what they are.

95
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,905
My mom says god
has a p-Plan for everyone.

96
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,507
I guess i was
plan "b".

97
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,977
You guys like
im-Impersonations?

98
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,545
Timmy!

99
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,846
How about
jimmy stewart?

100
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,616
"Merry christmas,
movie house."

101
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,883
And john travolta.

102
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,184
"Oh my god,
mr. Carter.

103
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,520
Mr. Carter, oh my god,
mr. Carter."

104
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,654
Jimmy's funny, dude.

105
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,159
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid
with disabilities in the world.

106
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,426
Hmm!

107
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,196
Ah, kenny,
it's 9:00.

108
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,462
Come on, stanley.

109
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,197
Oops, guess we're
out of time, kids.

110
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,967
Now remember, tomorrow
you all have bake sales

111
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,136
In your respective neighborhoods
to raise money.

112
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,437
We'll meet back here
next tuesday

113
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,606
And see who raised the most.
Good luck!

114
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,872
Hey, i've got
a great idea.

115
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,642
Why don't we see if jimmy wants
to come be in our scout club.

116
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,776
Hey, yeah.
Timmy, timmy.

117
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,980
Hey jimmy, you wanna come
join our bake sale tomorrow?

118
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,583
Jeez, sure, that'd be
great, thanks, fellas.

119
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,849
Come on, stan.

120
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,185
Bye big gay al,
we had great time.

121
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,452
Yeah, thanks.

122
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,753
Bye, jimmy!
Bye, jimmy!

123
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,089
See you tomorrow at
the bake sale, fellas.

124
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,258
You were right, dad,
scouts is awesome. Yeah!

125
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,861
We told ghost stories and learned how
to make a tornado in a glass bottle.

126
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,463
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes
and muffins for our bake sale.

127
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,163
And best of all, we met
this kid named jimmy.

128
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,367
He's disabled, but he doesn't let
it ruin his life. He's awesome!

129
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,501
Aah!

130
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,271
Yeah, we're gonna use him to
help raise money at our bake sale.

131
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,440
Cartman, don't say use him,
you big silly goose.

132
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,140
Ah!

133
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,042
What did you say?

134
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,778
I just called
cartman a name,

135
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:39,645
He's a silly goose.

136
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,911
Uh-Huh.

137
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,514
You do not say
"big silly goose"!

138
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,284
You call him an asshole
like a normal kid.

139
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,984
But dad, i was
just trying to-

140
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,055
Stanley, you call your friend
an asshole this instant!

141
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,322
Asshole.

142
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,057
That's better.

143
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,261
Don't call me asshole,
you som'bitch.

144
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,863
Ah, hello.

145
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,767
We're having a bake sale to
raise money for scout troop #69.

146
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,936
Ah, please stop by
and give us a hand.

147
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,202
And now, for your
entertainment,

148
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:08,274
Our new best friend,
stand-Up comic jimmy!

149
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,841
Wow, what a great
audience.

150
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:14,780
I just flew into south park,
boy are my crutches tired.

151
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,480
What a terrific audience.

152
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,250
You know, people
sometimes ask me,

153
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,853
"Are you angry at god
for making disabled people?"

154
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:25,191
I say, "no, i think the world
is better with president bush."

155
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,059
What a brave
little boy.

156
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,697
He's able to use comedy
to overcome his handicap.

157
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,831
I love him!

158
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,902
Well, i sure have met a lot of
interesting people here in south park.

159
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,505
How about that
eric cartman kid, huh?

160
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,107
"God damn it,
no chicken pot pies!

161
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,843
God damn it!
God damn it!"

162
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,662
Heh, heh.
I don't sound like that.

163
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:49,824
And how about that
school counselor?

164
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,952
"Drugs are bad,
drugs are bad, m'kay.

165
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,704
Drugs are bad, okay.
Okay."

166
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,448
Wow, what a great
audience.

167
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,122
"Mr. Happy, quiet,
mr. Hat.

168
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,326
"Hello there,
children, mr. Hat.

169
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,592
"Hello, mr. Hat.

170
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,796
"I think it's all
very sacrilege-

171
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,496
It's all very
sacrilege... "

172
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,966
"God damn it!
God damn it!"

173
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,736
And of course,
my very favorite...

174
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,870
"Timmy! Timmy!

175
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,507
I'm living a lie,
i'm living a lie, timmy!"

176
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,978
"Timmy,
i'm living a lie.

177
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,678
Ah, timmy!"

178
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,882
Sometimes it's like, "please,
timmy, learn a new word."

179
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,617
"Timmy! Timmy!"

180
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:25,918
Aahh!

181
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,256
Wow, it looks like
when it comes to comedy

182
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,791
I really
take the c-C...

183
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,426
I really take the ca...

184
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,027
I really take
the ca-Cake.

185
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,497
Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy!

186
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,666
Timmy!

187
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,739
Well, this is it, we've simply
gotten too many complaints

188
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,491
From concerned parents
about him.

189
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,209
I'm afraid we don't
have a choice.

190
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,475
Hi ya, fellas!

191
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,028
How are you
today, scout?

192
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,546
I'm super,
thanks for asking.

193
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,680
The troops are off
having bake sales,

194
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,450
And i'm pleased to report
that we have already raised

195
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:01,053
Over $600 for
the event- Yippy!

196
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,753
Uh, big gay al,

197
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:07,126
It's recently come to our
attention that you are... gay.

198
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,392
Well, stop the presses.

199
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,162
You figure that out all
by yourself, silly buns?

200
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,897
Yes, well,
unfortunately for you

201
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,367
The scouts have a policy
that openly gay men

202
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,634
Cannot belong.

203
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,404
We are left with
no options, mr. Al.

204
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,741
We're afraid you are
herebyoutof scouts.

205
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,875
Out of scouts?

206
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,610
We're sorry,
mr. Gay al.

207
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,814
But i've been in scouts
since i was nine,

208
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,514
It's a huge part
of my life.

209
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:33,585
You must understand that
scouts is a private club,

210
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,887
A club that follows
certain beliefs,

211
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,658
And one of those beliefs is that
homosexuality is immoral.

212
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,925
I see.

213
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,660
It's nothing against you
personally.

214
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,863
What if i promise not
to be gay anymore?

215
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,130
Pinky swear!

216
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,900
We think it's best
you just move on.

217
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,502
Right, move on.

218
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,507
Oh, hey, timmy.

219
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,808
I'm glad you
called, very much.

220
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,012
I've been detecting some
animosity towards me lately,

221
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,747
And i was hoping
we could bury the hatchet.

222
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,013
Timmy.

223
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,315
What's that?

224
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,616
A- Libba-La,
timmy.

225
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,386
A present, you
got me a present?

226
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,652
Timmy!

227
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:09,954
Gee, you didn't
have to do that.

228
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,157
I mean, i understand why
you'd be jealous of my talents.

229
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,459
If you work at it
maybe you could be

230
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,627
As handi-Capable
as i am, huh?

231
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,929
Wow, a parka.

232
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,664
You didn't have to
do that, tim-Tim.

233
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:19,930
Tim, timmy.

234
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,533
Oh sure, i'll see
if it fits.

235
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,604
This is very warm,
thanks a lot, tim-Tim.

236
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,905
Well, i'll see you
around.

237
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,207
Timmy!

238
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,581
There he is,
kill him, kill him!

239
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,316
Oh, wait,
that's not him.

240
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,955
Thanks, again,
tim-Tim!

241
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,690
Tim, timmy!

242
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,489
Ah, bye, scouts.

243
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,692
Okay, okay, mark,
stop playing now.

244
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,393
Hey, don't
yell at me.

245
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,163
You asked me to come over
and play sad songs

246
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,898
For you to pack to,
and then you yell at me.

247
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:27,633
I'm sorry, i'm sorry.

248
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,368
But now i've packed
everything away, so just-

249
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,369
Play something
uplifting like,

250
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:35,006
I'm-Gonna-Put-All-This-Behind-
Me-And-Make-It-Okay music.

251
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,609
? Oh, i don't want her
you can have her?

252
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,911
? She's too fat
for me?

253
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,080
Oh, jesus, mark.

254
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,020
Parents, this is the new
scout leader, mr. Grazier.

255
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,189
He will be taking over
for the homosexual.

256
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,056
Nice to meet you.

257
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,322
Marsh, right?

258
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:53,659
We actually kind of
know each other.

259
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,960
Your wife and mine
are friends.

260
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,660
Your wife, huh?

261
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:59,081
Carol is is the head of a
girls' mountain scouts troop.

262
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:01,467
Well, i guess we're off to
the bar until nine then.

263
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,733
Gonna go pound
some brews, huh?

264
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,370
And so i says to him,
"hey, i may be handicapped,

265
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,938
But i'm not deaf."

266
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,107
Wow, what a
terrific audience.

267
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,311
Well, for my next joke,
i'm gonna need a volunteer

268
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,612
From the audience,
very much.

269
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,913
How about you,
timmy?

270
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,746
Timmy.

271
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,516
Sure, come on
up here, tim-Tim.

272
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,251
Timmy, ladies
and gentlemen.

273
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,951
Let's all give him
a hand, very much.

274
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:22,721
Come to think of it, give
him a pair of legs, too.

275
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,757
Here, timmy, put on
this silly hat.

276
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,943
Just for
a second, timmy.

277
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,121
Don't be a jerk,
timmy.

278
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:32,264
Hey, don't push me!

279
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,964
Timmy!

280
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,300
Cripple fight!

281
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,602
That is enough,
scouts!

282
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,903
Take your seats!

283
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,603
Aww!

284
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,457
All right, scouts, i am your
new scout master, mr. Grazier.

285
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:45,186
Together we are going to become
the best, the sleekest,

286
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,880
The most well-Polished
scout troop in all of colorado.

287
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:49,580
Isn't that right?

288
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,881
When i ask you
a question

289
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,651
You will answer
"yes, scout master."

290
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,917
Do i make myself clear?

291
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:54,820
Yes, scout master!

292
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,520
Good.

293
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,158
Now, the first activity
for this evening will be...

294
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,893
Naked pictures.

295
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,495
I'm going to take some pictures
of each of you naked

296
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,664
In case we need them
for later.

297
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,497
Aww! Aww!

298
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,232
Oh, what is this?!

299
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,002
If there's one thing i hate
it's a whiny platoon.

300
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,736
"We don't wanna
do push-Ups!

301
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,003
"We don't
wanna get up early!

302
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:15,641
We don't wanna have you
take naked pictures of us!"

303
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,907
Man, this guy sucks.

304
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,978
Now, fall in and
strip down, scouts!

305
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,882
All right, scouts,
we're gonna end this meeting

306
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,184
With a little
puppet show.

307
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:26,919
Here's a little scout.

308
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:30,389
He's always prepared,
he's always ready.

309
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,208
Now, here's the little scout
telling his parents

310
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,594
That mr. Grazier took
naked pictures of him.

311
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,895
Look what happens.

312
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,064
"Oh, no!
Oh, oh!

313
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,198
Ohh!"

314
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,968
Do i make
myself clear, scouts?

315
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,269
Yes, scout master!

316
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,969
Oh, hello, parents.

317
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,739
All right, that's all the time
we have for tonight, scouts.

318
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,474
We sure had a great time,
didn't we?

319
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:51,175
Yes, sir,
scout master!

320
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,812
Wow, you sure whipped
those kids into shape.

321
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,198
Yeah, now they're
acting like men.

322
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,150
Well, you know what
i say about kids-

323
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,451
They're all pink
on the inside.

324
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,986
You bet.
I heard that.

325
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,487
See ya,
mr. Grazier.

326
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,548
Go away, i'm dead.

327
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,899
Oh, well,
here he is.

328
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,201
Big gay al,
what are you doing?

329
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,537
Yeah, get your big
gay ass off the couch

330
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,838
And come be our
scout master again!

331
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,538
I can't, kids.

332
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,308
I've been kicked out
of scouts.

333
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,008
Kicked out?
Oh no.

334
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,778
But you have to come back,
we hate our new scout leader.

335
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,478
Really, why?

336
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:31,116
We can't tell you.

337
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,382
Why not?

338
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,852
Oh, no, no!
Oh, no no, no no!

339
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:40,225
Please, big gay al, we don't wanna go
on a camp trip with this guy next week.

340
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,411
Boys, there's
nothing i can do.

341
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:44,563
The scouts don't
allow homosexuals.

342
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,829
Well then,
that settles it.

343
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,564
Fellas, what we're
gonna have to do

344
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,202
Is try to change the
scouts' rules, very much.

345
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,937
What do we want?

346
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,203
Gays in scouts!

347
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,938
When do we want it?
Timmy!

348
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:56,275
What do we want?
Gays in scouts!

349
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,576
When do we
want it?

350
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,328
Timmy!

351
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,046
Ohh, no.

352
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:06,034
What do we want?
Gays in scouts!

353
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,517
When do we want it?
Timmy!

354
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,721
All right, this looks like the
perfect place to get some signatures.

355
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,890
Puppies, puppies
for sale.

356
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,059
Beat it, toots, we got
discrimination work to do.

357
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,325
All right,
let's set up.

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,529
Hi, we're here to collect
signatures in support

359
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,264
To force the scouts
to accept gays.

360
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,433
Ah, hello,
gays in scouts?

361
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,699
God damn it.

362
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,903
Hey, why don't we have jimmy
do some stand-Up comedy,

363
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,638
Like in our
bake sale, very much?

364
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:27,939
That's a great idea.

365
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,108
Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
now for your entertainment,

366
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,410
Stand-Up comic jimmy!

367
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,543
Wow, what a
great audience.

368
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,181
For my first joke i'm gonna
need a volunteer.

369
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,350
Come on up here, tim-Tim.

370
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,254
Timmy, when i tell you to
do something, you do it.

371
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,121
Timmy!

372
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:44,856
Timmy, don't make me
kick your ass.

373
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,123
Timmy!

374
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,025
Put on your hat!

375
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,893
Timmy!

376
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,194
P- Put it on!

377
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,797
Dude, this looks like
it could get ugly.

378
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,700
Timmy... timmy.

379
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,436
Not this year.

380
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,773
Timmy, tim.

381
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,677
Cripple fight!

382
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,015
Come on...
come on!

383
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,353
Timmy.

384
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,630
Cripple fight!

385
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,534
Attention shoppers,

386
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:32,137
Outside today
we have cripple fight.

387
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,872
Cripple fight outside.

388
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,246
Come on.

389
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,716
Oh, oh!

390
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,620
Jesus christ, dude.

391
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh my god!

392
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,873
Just let 'em
have it out, susan.

393
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,392
They'll run
out of steam soon.

394
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,946
Hel-Lo, timmy.

395
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,464
Hel-Lo, timmy!

396
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,216
Tim-My!

397
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,743
Ugnh!

398
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,236
Ahh!

399
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,684
Timmy...

400
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,189
I told you,
put on the hat!

401
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,431
You dirty
mother!

402
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,336
What's going on?

403
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,540
Some kind of
gay pride rally.

404
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,553
Whoa!

405
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,277
Aaaah!

406
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,254
Timmy!

407
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,797
Tom, i'm standing out front
ofhenry's supermarket

408
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,966
Where five brave little boys
are holding a rally

409
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,134
To support gays
in scouting.

410
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,268
The rally is drawing
so much attention

411
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:48,340
That people from all over the
country are taking media notice.

412
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,075
Those boys have
shown me the light.

413
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,677
I never knew the mountain scouts
was a hate group.

414
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,846
This is a wake-Up call
to america.

415
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,015
We cannot turn our backs
on gays anymore.

416
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,583
Oh god, they're
actually pulling it off.

417
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,751
The rally has also
caught the attention

418
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,955
Of old scouts members,
like steven spielberg,

419
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,992
Director of such films
as "always" and "1941".

420
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,160
I salute those boys
and their courage.

421
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:13,064
I am hereby cutting all my
funding to the scouts!

422
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,366
The rally has also
caught the attention

423
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,535
Of high-Power lawyer
gloria allred.

424
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,137
It is a disgrace
that these homophobes

425
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,872
Are allowed to
discriminate!

426
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,475
I am taking this case on
personally!

427
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,741
With this kind
of support, tom,

428
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,379
These boys are sure to
have a victory for gays.

429
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,697
Back to you.

430
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:29,981
Thanks, chris.

431
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,584
In other news, the f.B.I. Has
finally caught the child molester

432
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,284
Known as
"mr. Slippy fist".

433
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,019
The sick child molester
was found

434
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:39,524
With disturbing, graphic photos
of young boys naked,

435
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,276
Which we will
show you now.

436
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,994
Here's one.
And here's another.

437
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,096
Eddie?

438
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,128
Oh my god.

439
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,332
Hey, look at this one,
sick son of a bitch.

440
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,633
There's one right here.

441
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,935
Aaah!

442
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:02,514
Timmy!

443
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,262
All right, boys,
break it up.

444
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,967
All rise.

445
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,472
In the case of big gay al vs.
Mountain scouts of america,

446
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,040
Due to the overwhelming
show of support,

447
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,545
It is the ruling of this court
that the scouts must allow

448
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,147
Big gay al, and all gays,
into their club!

449
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,715
All right!

450
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,353
Well, we've all learned
an important lesson.

451
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,619
That just because
somebody's gay

452
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,823
Doesn't mean they're gonna
molest children.

453
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,558
Straight people
do that too.

454
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,258
Yeah!

455
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,028
And furthermore,
the scout elders

456
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,162
Will be put into stocks
for three days,

457
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,667
So they can see how it feels
to be outcasts.

458
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,853
We did it!
We did it!

459
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,005
I did it!
I did it!

460
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,306
Ha, ha!

461
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,175
Today is a great day
for democracy.

462
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,547
The scouts have been exposed for
the vile gay bashers they are.

463
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,681
And we owe it all
to me!

464
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,319
And these six
brave little boys.

465
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,754
Five brave little boys.

466
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,392
And now, here to take
his official oath

467
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,862
Back into scouts
is big gay al!

468
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,048
Thank you all
very much.

469
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,792
But i don't
want this.

470
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:29,501
What?
What'd he say?

471
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:30,767
Huh?

472
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,838
Look, i appreciate what
you kids did, i really do.

473
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,140
But this isn't
what i wanted.

474
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm proud to be gay.

475
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,176
And i'm proud
to be in a country

476
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,345
Where i'm free
to express myself.

477
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,314
But freedom
is a two-Way street.

478
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,214
If i'm free
to express myself,

479
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,719
Then the scouts have to be free
to express themselves, too.

480
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,419
I know these men.

481
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,455
They are good men.
They're kind men.

482
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,659
They do what they think
is best for kids.

483
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,828
No matter how wrong
we think they might be,

484
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,298
It isn't right for us to
force them to think our way.

485
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,334
It's up to us to persuade
and help them see the light,

486
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,070
Not extort them, to.

487
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,637
Please, don't cut
the scouts' funding.

488
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,841
The scouts help and have always
helped a lot of kids.

489
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,107
That's why i love them.

490
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,745
I will continue to persuade them
to change their minds.

491
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,914
But this is the wrong way
to do it.

492
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,733
So, i am hereby
dropping my case

493
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:21,084
And allowing the scouts
their right

494
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,155
To not allow gays
into their private club.

495
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,422
Oh...

496
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,723
Hooray! Hooray!

497
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,927
So wait,
did we do good?

498
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,228
Yeah, i think so.

499
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,529
Yeah, we kick ass.

500
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,698
Come on, kids, let's go
get some ice cream.

501
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,133
You can't do this,
you homophobe!

502
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:40,204
Well, timmy, i guess we learned
an important lesson too, very much.

503
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,241
There is room for more than one
handi-Capable person in scouts.

504
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,109
Timmy!

505
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,410
I'm glad we're
best friends now.

506
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,711
See you at scouts.

507
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,579
Timmy!

508
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,519
? Timmy, timmy, timmy, timmy?

509
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,653
? Timmy, timmy, timmy?

510
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,857
? Timmy, timmy,
timmy, tim?

511
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,025
? Tim, tim, tim,
tim, tim?

512
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,726
Ahh!

513
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,062
Dude, timmy, come on, we're
gonna be late for scouts!

514
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:09,267
All right, boys, i am
your new scout leader.

515
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,436
Everything is going to be
just fine.

516
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,171
No naked pictures.

517
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,038
Ah, timmy?

518
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,773
Yes, timmy.

519
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,309
Oh, dear.

520
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,775
Jimmy?
Yes.

521
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,280
You know our policy, i'm afraid
you're out of scouts.

522
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,015
Out of scouts?

523
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,485
Timmy.
