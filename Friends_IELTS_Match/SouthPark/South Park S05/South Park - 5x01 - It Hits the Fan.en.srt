Hey, you guys,

15
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

16
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,204
Four tickets to
"the lion king" on stage.

17
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,505
Oh.
Oh.

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,674
Oh, come on, you guys,
it's supposed to be really cool.

19
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,808
Yeah, no,
it sounds really cool.

20
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,578
You guys, you guys,
oh my god!

21
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,844
Oh my god,
you guys!

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,013
What, dough boy?
I was just-

23
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,783
I was just watching the tv,
they had this commercial.

24
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,351
So?
They're gonna say

25
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,687
Tonight on that show
"cop drama".

26
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,422
What?
Guess.Me on,

27
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,591
They're gonna say something
that's never been said on tv.

28
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,326
What?!
You'll never guess.

29
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,592
What?!
Guess.

30
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,230
God damn it, cartman, what are
they gonna say on cop drama?

31
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,496
You ready?

32
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,869
Tonight on cop drama, on tv,
they're gonna say...

33
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,604
"Shit."

34
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,339
They're gonna
say shit on tv?

35
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,658
They can't say
shit on tv.

36
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:15,907
It was just on the news!

37
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:16,809
People are
freakin' out, dude!

38
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,075
Holy shit.

39
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,377
We gotta watch.

40
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,147
Yeah, i'm gonna have people
over my house to see it.

41
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,882
But i've got these tickets
to see lion king on stage.

42
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,068
Maybe you didn't
hear me, kyle,

43
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:27,184
I said "shit"
on television.

44
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,353
It's just a marketing ploy
by the network.

45
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:31,557
Like that time they had the first
male-To-Male kiss with terrance and phillip.

46
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,858
Oh, come on dude,
this is history.

47
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,125
It's stupid.

48
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,860
Jeez, you're a little
irritable, kyle.

49
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,630
What's the matter, you got
some sand in your vagina?

50
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:39,330
No, i don't have
sand in my vagina,

51
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,666
I just think it's a little immature
for us to be standing around,

52
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,269
Talking about one dumb word
being on tv!

53
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,455
Hey, ah, sam, did you
hear the news?

54
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,607
Yeah, they're gonna
say "shit" on tv.

55
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,077
We should all get together
and watch it at the bar.

56
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:51,909
Yeah!

57
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

58
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,981
Are you guys gonna
let your kids watch?

59
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:56,247
Oh, sure.

60
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,451
I mean, y'know, cop drama's
a very artsy, dramatic show.

61
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,620
And they're gonna
say "shit"!

62
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,656
Hey, butters, i got tickets
to go see lion king tonight,

63
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,825
And i decided to invite you
before anybody else.

64
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:07,525
Oh, sorry, i can't.

65
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,260
They're gonna say "shit"
on cop drama,

66
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,030
And my mom and dad say
i have to watch it with them

67
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,565
So that i don't take it
the wrong way.

68
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,066
How many ways are
there to take it?

69
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,766
It's just a stupid word!

70
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,970
Hey, everybody,
it's on in 30 minutes!

71
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,778
Listen, mitchell, i put my life
on the line every day.

72
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,079
How dare you accuseme!

73
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,031
Oh, i bet this is it,
here it comes.

74
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,514
I'm doing my job, frank.

75
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,284
We have to know where that
evidence was shipped.

76
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,019
Oh, was that it?
Was that it?

77
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,286
Shipped,
he said "shipped."

78
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,490
We don't have a record
of that, and besides,

79
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:40,526
Your job is to protect the men
who serve this force.

80
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,695
God damn it, when are
they gonna say "shit"?!

81
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,961
Shh!

82
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,599
Maybe... maybe
protect them from you.

83
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,733
Maybe you're forgetting
who you're talking to.

84
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,370
And maybe you're forgetting
i used to be a cop, too!

85
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,504
Yeah, you used to be
a lot of things!

86
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,142
Oh, he doesn't know mitchell
slept with his wife, does he?

87
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,894
That's it,
i've had enough of this.

88
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,612
Don't you turn your
back on me, you.

89
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,312
I said enough!

90
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,348
Is it?
Will it ever be enough?

91
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:07,420
Cop drama will return
after these messages.

92
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:08,955
Jesus christ,
another commercial!

93
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,421
Are they ever
gonna say "shit"?

94
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,625
I'm sure they're just holding
it to the very last scene.

95
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,492
Uh! Uh!

96
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:14,759
Where you going, kyle?

97
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,095
I'm going to the kitchen,
this is stupid!

98
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,361
But you're gonna miss it.

99
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,698
They're gonna say "shit"
and you're gonna miss it.

100
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,433
I don't really
give a.

101
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,133
Oh.

102
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,336
Just understand
that it's my job.

103
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,505
I still think
you're a good cop.

104
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,674
Well, mitchell, i guess
you're going to do

105
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,940
What you're gonna do.

106
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:32,144
Let's just try and stay
friends no matter what.

107
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,747
You're right, maybe
i'll see you around.

108
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,916
Goodbye.
Oh, and mitchell-

109
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,518
You've got some shit on the
side of your mouth right there.

110
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,253
Oh, yeah,
thanks, thanks.

111
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,355
Wow!

112
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,340
Whoa!

113
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,266
Whoa!

114
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,157
Whoa!

115
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:48,592
They did it.

116
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,327
I can't believe
they actually said it.

117
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,314
Dude, you missed it, kyle,
it was so awesome!

118
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,266
Well, i hope it lived up
to all the hype.

119
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,966
You must feel
somuch better now.

120
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,737
Kyle, we've gotta get that
sand out of your vagina,

121
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,304
It's making you cranky,
does it itch?

122
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,074
Do you really think anything's
gonna be any different now?

123
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,375
Do you really think
that this will have

124
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,111
The tiniest, smallest
effect on the world?

125
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,279
It's still the same old
world out there, look!

126
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,183
What the hell?

127
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:12,918
Whoa, dude,
it's raining frogs.

128
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,220
Oh, whatever.

129
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,472
Last night the daring
and bold show "cop drama"

130
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,292
Broke new ground by
saying "shit!" On television,

131
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,329
Making shit officially okay
to say around the country.

132
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,463
A recent poll shows
that 24% of americans

133
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,100
Think the show has pushed
the envelope too far,

134
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,800
While a whopping 76%

135
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,787
Say they don't really
give a shit.

136
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,704
In other news,
a strange virus

137
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,341
Which causes victims to
vomit up their intestines

138
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,944
Is making life shitty
for a small farming community.

139
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,078
Rick watts
has the story.

140
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:44,366
Thanks, tom, shit is
certainly going down

141
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,620
Here in the small town-
Rah rah rarlb!

142
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,355
Whoa, shit!

143
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,042
All right, children,
in lieu of the common usage

144
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:54,994
I'm supposed to clarify
the school's position

145
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,694
On the word "shit".

146
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,030
Wow, we can say "shit"
in school now?

147
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,331
Oh, this is
ridiculous.

148
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,465
Just because they say it
on tv, it's all right?

149
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,537
Yes, but only in the figurative
noun form or the adjective form.

150
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:05,803
Heh?

151
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,007
You can only use it
in the non-Literal sense.

152
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,273
For instance:

153
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,477
"That's a shitty
picture of me."

154
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,743
Is now fine.

155
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,079
However, the literal
noun form of

156
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:17,550
"This is a picture of shit,"
is still naughty.

157
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,851
I don't get it.
Me neither.

158
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,020
The adjective form is now
also acceptable.

159
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,889
"The weather
outside is shitty."

160
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,526
However, the literal adjective
is not appropriate.

161
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,226
For example:

162
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,298
"My bad diarrhea made the inside
of the toilet bowl shitty,

163
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,249
"And i had to clean it
with a rag

164
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:35,768
Which then also
became shitty."

165
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,503
That's right out.

166
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,038
S... s...

167
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,504
Shit!

168
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,057
Very good, timmy.

169
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,541
Ah, ms. Choksondik.

170
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,276
Can we say it
in the expletive?

171
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,479
Like, "oh shit!"
Or "shit on a shingle"?

172
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,180
Yes, that's now fine.

173
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,166
Wow, this is
gonna be great-

174
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,083
A whole new word.
It's not new!

175
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,721
I'm gonna look "shit" up in
the encyclopedia and prove it.

176
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:56,987
Don't mind kyle, everyone,

177
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,757
He's just got a little
sand in his vagina.

178
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,160
There's no sand
in my vagina!

179
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,494
Boys, watch your
language, shit!

180
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,698
And so children, instead of
saying, "hand in your papers."

181
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:08,300
I may now say,
"hand in your shit."

182
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,000
Any questions?

183
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:11,770
What about, "i have to
take a shit"?

184
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,037
No, no, filmore!

185
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,807
You can say, "i have to
poop and shit."

186
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,342
Or "oh shit,
i have to poop."

187
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,760
But not
"i have to shit."

188
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,554
Are we all clear?
No! No!

189
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,313
Look, it's all
about context.

190
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,350
For example, recently
i have come out

191
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:27,386
And admitted that
i was a homosexual- I'm gay.

192
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,724
That means that now i can say
the word- "Fag".

193
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,194
On tv, they usually
don't allow- "Fag".

194
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,761
But because i'm gay
it's all right.

195
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,832
And with the new approval
of the word "shit",

196
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,869
That means that
finally i am free to say...

197
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,489
? Hey there
shitty shitty fag fag?

198
00:06:46,524 --> 00:06:48,883

199
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:51,208

201
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,581
Oh, this is great.

202
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,317
Well, that store
has such lovely shit.

203
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:03,822
Yeah, too bad i don't have
shit for cash right now.

204
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,991
Ohh, looks like the weather
might turn shitty.

205
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,258
Oh, i don't really
give a shit.

206
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,461
I've done enough shit
outside today and shit.

207
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,763
Shit, peter,
you look like shit.

208
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,732
No shit, i feel like shit.

209
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,667
I think i-
Blargg blargg!

210
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,933
Holy shit!

211
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,486
Did you see
that shit?!

212
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,969
What kind of
shit is this?

213
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,271
That is some
weird shit.

214
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,572
Susan, your shit's ready!

215
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,474
You know where
this shit goes?

216
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:23,342
Shit if i know.

217
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,860
Nice going,
shit for brains.

218
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:25,945
? Old macdonald
took a shit?

219
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,263
? E-I-E-I-O?

220
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,547
Dumb shit!

221
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,137
? Hey there
shitty shitty fag fag?

222
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,306
? Shitty shitty fag fag
how do ya do?

223
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,139
? Hey there-?

224
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,909
Oh shit, excuse me.

225
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,444
Hey, watch it, fag!

226
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,862
What did you call me?

227
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,246
I called you a fag.

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,150
Because i'm gay, and that means
i'm free to use the word "fag"!

229
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,319
So piss off,
you fag shitter.

230
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,585
Ha, ha, ha!

231
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,754
? Hey there
shitty shitty fag fag?

232
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,392
? Shitty shitty fag fag
ba doop a doop doo?

233
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,658
This sucks.

234
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,428
Now that shit's out, it
isn't fun to say it anymore.

235
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,380
Yeah, they've taken all
the fun out of "shit".

236
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,898
We're gonna have to start
saying other bad words,

237
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,067
Like "cock" and
and meecrob.

238
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,334
What's "meecrob"?

239
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,971
That stuff you get as an
appetizer at thal food restaurants.

240
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,539
Meecrob is way grosser
than shit, dude.

241
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,743
I'd scarf down a whole
wet bucket full of shit

242
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,044
Before i ate another
plate of meecrob.

243
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,310
You guys, you guys!

244
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,479
I looked up
the word "shit".

245
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:37,683
I think it might have something
to do with people dying.

246
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,949
What?

247
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,250
Haven't you noticed
everyone getting sick?

248
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,454
It all started when they
said "shit" on television.

249
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,206
Oh kyle, you are
so full of meecrob.

250
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,924
I am not full
of meecro- What?

251
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,395
Look, the word "shit" first
showed up in english in the 1340s,

252
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,997
The same time as something
called "the black death".

253
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:52,865
What's that?

254
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,599
Kyle, do you still have
sand in your vagina

255
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,901
About us not going to
lion king with you?

256
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,202
I mean, shit, dude,
let it go.

257
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:58,720
Look, it might be
coincidence,

258
00:08:58,755 --> 00:08:59,805
But i think
we better ask someone.

259
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,540
Come on!

260
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,349
A 75 share- My god, i never
thought it was possible.

261
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,987
Sir, your "shit" idea has
turned the entire network around.

262
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,156
We're proud to work for you.

263
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,758
Sir, i'd just like to
take this opportunity-

264
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,458
And i'm sure i speak
for all of us-

265
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,530
When i say, you are the most
creative genius in hollywood.

266
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,000
And well, i'd let you
have me if you wanted.

267
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,169
Thanks, roger, but i've
only just started.

268
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,704
You see, i've
already figured out

269
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,205
Our new marketing
scheme-Technique

270
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,740
For the next
run of shows.

271
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,241
Whoa!
He's unstoppable.

272
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,410
What's the new idea?
I can hardly wait.

273
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,676
I'm about to
piss myself.

274
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:44,049
This saturday, onhbc,
we're going to say...

275
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,018
"Shit"...

276
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,918
Twice.

277
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,688
Twice!
Brilliant.

278
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,989
Think of the
repetition.

279
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:53,375
It's like saying it
once, but double.

280
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,327
Well, gentlemen,
let's get on it.

281
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,628
Ho!
Ho!

282
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,665
? Baby
you are so fine?

283
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,931
? And shit?

284
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,135
? The shit you do
the shit you say?

285
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,304
? I'll jump on
your shit any day?

286
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,605
Oh, hello there,
children.

287
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,871
Hey, chef.

288
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,641
Chef, do you know where
shit comes from?

289
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,394
Uh, from your ass,
children.

290
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:13,112
No, no, no-
The word "shit".

291
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,378
Ohh...

292
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,148
Detective sandy vagina here
thinks that "shit"

293
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,317
Might have something to do
with everyone getting sick.

294
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,052
It said in my book
that the word "shit"

295
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,318
Started the
exact same time

296
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:23,088
As something called
"the black death".

297
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,257
The black death?
Are you sure?

298
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,209
What's the
black death, chef?

299
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,727
Latoya jackson,
children.

300
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,028
Ohh!

301
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,631
But i think back in those days
it meant something else-

302
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,632
The plague.

303
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:39,138
It says here the word "shit" has
been around for over 600 years.

304
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,740
It comes from the anglo-Saxon
word "scite".

305
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,440
Right, but in the 1340s,

306
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:44,776
People in england
stopped calling it "scite"

307
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,945
And started
calling it "shit"-

308
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,645
The same year as
the black plague.

309
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,283
This is the oldest book
in the library-

310
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,886
A priceless original of
england's history.

311
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,922
Just about everything you could
want to know about the plague

312
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,657
Is in this great tome.

313
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,693
Oh, shit.

314
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:05,164
Well, this other book has
some good information too.

315
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,864
The black plague-

316
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,417
Over half of europe
was killed by it.

317
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:09,935
Look, they're puking out
their intestines

318
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,670
Just like the people here.

319
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,971
Look at this, children,

320
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,140
It says the people in england
believed the plague was a curse.

321
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,840
"A dark magic infliction

322
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,912
Brought on by a mass utterance
of a word of curse."

323
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,213
Word of curse?

324
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,648
A... curse word.
Of course!

325
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,286
I've never even thought about why
we use the term "curse word" before.

326
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,888
Because it brings a curse,
like the black death.

327
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,155
You guys, look here.

328
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,890
In this
"nancy drew" mystery

329
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,093
Nancy goes to the beach and
gets sand trapped in her shoe.

330
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,696
This could explain how
kyle got it in his vagina.

331
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,997
Cartman,
this is serious!

332
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,697
So am i, kyle.

333
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:42,034
If that sand in your vagina
doesn't get released

334
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,769
You could become
a walking time bomb.

335
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,070
Heh, heh, heh.

336
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,638
If you don't mind
i'll have to close up now.

337
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,709
They're going to say "shit"
seven times on hbc and-

338
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,010
Blargg,
blarg-Blarg-Blarg!

339
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,144
Holy shit!
Oh-Ho, gross!

340
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,914
Dude, this plague is
spreading like wildfire.

341
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,951
Uh-Oh.

342
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,217
Uh-Oh.

343
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,770
Kenny's got it,
heh, heh.

344
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,197
We gotta
do something, chef.

345
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,555
If we don't stop
that network

346
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,325
"Shit" will become an even
more acceptable word.

347
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:08,927
Children, we've got to warn
those producers in hollywood

348
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,397
That the plague and "shit",
could be linked.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,169
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

350
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,338
If you look out the right side
of the aircraft

351
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,073
You can see some
interesting shit.

352
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,773
And over on the left side

353
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,375
There's some
interesting shit too.

354
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,579
We should be arriving in
los angeles in about two hours.

355
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,314
Until then, we invite you
to sit back, relax

356
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,049
And enjoy our
shitty service.

357
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,519
God damn it, kenny, don't
get your plague germs on me!

358
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,255
Cartman, stop
being an asshole!

359
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,630
The ratings are in, sir.

360
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,365
We broke another
record last night

361
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,870
With the show that
said "shit" seven times.

362
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,171
Where is the roof
on this thing?

363
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,340
I mean, how can we
top ourselves now?

364
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,474
Gentlemen, i have it.

365
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:00,112
The end-All, greatest marketing
ploy of all time.

366
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:07,017
Tonight, on hbc, we will air
all our sitcoms live

367
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,956
And have everyone say "shit"
in place of their written lines.

368
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,992
And we'll call it
"must shit tv".

369
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,259
Bravo!

370
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,595
Night of a
million shits!

371
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,764
Now, doing this live
will be difficult, so we-

372
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,065
Hold on a minute,
mr. Producer.

373
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,331
Who are you?

374
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,101
My name is chef, and
these are the children.

375
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,235
We've come to
warn you about "shit".

376
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,439
Oh brother, another
christian protest group.

377
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,174
Who wants to
take this one?

378
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,440
I'll get it.

379
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,175
Gentlemen, we appreciate
your concern.

380
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,512
Here at hbc,
the general goal is

381
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,646
Providing the highest, most
thought-Provoking entertainment.

382
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,416
How great is it that we live in a country
where an artist can express himself freely.

383
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,116
That's not only the american
spirit, it's the hbc spirit.

384
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,320
Which allows us to make great family
programming, like "halo the turtle".

385
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,020
And of course, everyone's
favorite show, "cop drama".

386
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,356
We can't thank you enough for
bringing your concerns to our network.

387
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,525
For it is you, the loyal hbc
viewer, who makes this great network.

388
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,694
And indeed, the great
country that it is.

389
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,996
All right now,
as i was saying-

390
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:55,165
Hey, hold on a minute!
Are they still here?

391
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,369
Haven't you people noticed all
the strange things going on?

392
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,772
We think that
you might have caused it

393
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,140
By helping make "shit"
an everyday word.

394
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,242
Right, right.

395
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,309
It's true.

396
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,044
We think that word might be
plaguing our friend kenny.

397
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,346
Do you have any
proof of this?

398
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,647
No.

399
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,032
Then get out of here before
we have you thrown out.

400
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,984
But we can keep the
"halo the turtle" dolls, right?

401
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,552
Damn cracker-Ass
producers!

402
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,322
Now, what are we
gonna do, chef?

403
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,022
I don't know,
children.

404
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,226
I guess we got to get the word
out to people some other way.

405
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,395
Aaahh!

406
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh shit!

407
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,432
Aaahh!

408
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,733
Stand aside!

409
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,937
All right, now we have to get all
our biggest names to say "shit".

410
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,455
And then
we're gonna-

411
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,539
Halt your evil plans!

412
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,806
Huh?

413
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,009
I possess the
"rune stone of undoing".

414
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,612
Who is in charge here?

415
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,312
Oh, no!

416
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,950
You guys didn't hire me
a stripper for my birthday.

417
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,084
Oh, tell me
you guys didn't.

418
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,155
Show your true form, geldan,
lest you be afraid.

419
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,493
Your short time
in this world is at an end.

420
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,095
Ach! The rune stone
has no effect.

421
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,414
You are not geldan.

422
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,698
I never said i was.

423
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,398
You'll die anyway!

424
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,337
For you have spread
the word of curse.

425
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,957
Security!

426
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:10,507
Aach!

427
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,843
Who are you?

428
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,145
Take this.

429
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,880
What are we supposed
to do with it?

430
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,048
Ehhhgggh.

431
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,749
Now what?

432
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,952
We've got to find people who know
what the hell this is all about.

433
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,121
Children, we're gonna
have to go to the land

434
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,290
Of castles, knights
and kings.

435
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,797
Lords and ladies,
we bid you welcome

436
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,833
To the grandest casino
in the land-

437
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,834
Excalibur!

438
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,906
Take a free spin,
double your odds.

439
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,658
Excuse me,
do you work here?

440
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,376
How can i help you,
noble sir?

441
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,545
We need some help identifying
an ancient english stone.

442
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,245
A what?

443
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,414
It might hold the key
to a curse.

444
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,352
Uh, i can help get you some
credit or a comp meal perhaps.

445
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,321
Dude, we need help
from the british.

446
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,256
Look, kid,
this is just a casino.

447
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,558
I can't help you.

448
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,258
You know, not every
british person

449
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,895
Knows about wizards
and dragons and curses.

450
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,029
We just need help
identifying this.

451
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,667
A rune stone of gaelic!
Where did you get this?

452
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,402
You know what it is?

453
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,004
The skire once spoke
of such a stone.

454
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,058
Come, we must
see the sorcerer.

455
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:19,042
Get ready for
must shit tv!

456
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,981
Starting now, four straight
hours of pure shit!

457
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,167
It's all live!

458
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,128
Hey... shit.

459
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,019
Hey, shit.

460
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,055
Yeah, yeah shit.

461
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,126
This is it,
my greatest work.

462
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,694
Cocktails,
cocktails.

463
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,898
These americans
wish to see the skire.

464
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,067
Let us make haste
to the inner sanctum.

465
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,669
How could you foolish americans
bring the wrath of scorn

466
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,072
By mass chanting the word
of wretchedness?

467
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,406
Uh, yeah,
we didn't mean to.

468
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,043
Didn't you realize "shit"
is a curse word?

469
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:55,080
Well, yeah, but i don't think we
knew that "curse word" meant...

470
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,780
Curse word.

471
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,417
Ha, leave it to americans to
think that no means yes,

472
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,117
Pissed means angry

473
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:03,321
And curse word
means something

474
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,490
Other than a word
that's cursed!

475
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,045
Let me see the stone.

476
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,528
But i don't get it,

477
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,263
People use curse words
all the time.

478
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,033
Saying a word of curse once
in a while does nothing.

479
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,636
It's only when spoken
repeatedly and en masse

480
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:19,371
That the curse
takes place.

481
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,106
I've seen this before.

482
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,142
Stones that were used by the
knights of standards and practices.

483
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,276
Knights of standards
and practices?

484
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,480
A legion of men sworn to do
whatever necessary

485
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,215
To keep the words at bay.

486
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,167
But, they were
just a myth.

487
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,650
You know what?

488
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,769
You're dumb as shit.

489
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,854
Oh yeah?

490
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,554
Well, i don't really
give a shit.

491
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,758
You know, that word's
getting kind of old.

492
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,059
It's not really
funny anymore.

493
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,794
Yeah, they're gonna
have to come up with

494
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,329
A new swear word soon.

495
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,795
Well, they
can't use fag,

496
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,433
Because you can't say fag
unless you're a homosexual.

497
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,699
Really?

498
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,001
So we can't
say?

499
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,337
No, see,
you got beeped.

500
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,373
You mean you have to be a
to say?

501
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:56,640
That's right.

502
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,941
Well, that's not fair.

503
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,928
I should be able
to say fag.

504
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,880
Hey, you didn't
get beeped.

505
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,146
Uh-Oh.

506
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,482
Well, well, well,
guess we learned

507
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,085
Something new about you,
jimbo, you friggin' fag.

508
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,837
You wanna make out
or something?

509
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,520
Oh, man,
i am up shit creek.

510
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:12,941
Serves you right,
shit for brains.

511
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,327
Man, how could i be
such a dumb sh-

512
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,363
Say not the word
of curse!

513
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,195
Ugh!

514
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,531
What the-?

515
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,833
Holy shit!

516
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,834
Oh boy, this show is really
reaching for plot now.

517
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,472
The knights were formed to keep
curse words to a minimum.

518
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,075
Should a curse word ever be
let out, they would return.

519
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,243
A rune stone for each
word of curse was made,

520
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:35,714
Representing each of the eight
words that so offended god.

521
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,015
Look, there's
the "f" word.

522
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,847
And asshole.

523
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,583
I knew it-
Meecrob!

524
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,884
Meecrobis
a curse word!

525
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,220
God must hate it
as much as i do.

526
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,486
Look at this.

527
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,221
The writing here
claims this stone

528
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,824
Can defeat the evil geldan
who will arise

529
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,895
When the word of curse has been
said enough times to give him power.

530
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,064
Then all the world
will be destroyed.

531
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,366
All the world
destroyed?

532
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:55,233
My house too?

533
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,933
Oh, no!
What?

534
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,571
Tonight is the night of
a million shits on hbc!

535
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,306
It's gonna be said
over and over.

536
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,607
Then we haven't
much time.

537
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,873
We must go.

538
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,860
Turn off those devices
of broadcast!

539
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,777
What is going on here?
Stop this shit.

540
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,849
We are the royal order of
standards and practices!

541
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:13,885
We command you to stop
saying the curse word.

542
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,585
Listen,
mr. Shiny pants,

543
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,355
I am the head
of this network,

544
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,392
And i will say "shit"
all i want.

545
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,959
Shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

546
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,163
Shit shit shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit shit shit.

547
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,000
Shit shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit shit.

548
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:30,802
Shit shit shit shit
shit shit shit shit!

549
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,683
Oh!

550
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,417
Oh my god!

551
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,719
Run, run!

552
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,888
Oh, shit.

553
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,158
And now back to
must shit tv,

554
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,326
Here on hbc.

555
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,762
He is too strong!

556
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,965
We cannot fight him
without the rune stone!

557
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,666
My, my god, sir,

558
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,436
What have you unleashed
upon the world?

559
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,622
I didn't know.

560
00:20:06,657 --> 00:20:08,738
I didn't know!

561
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:12,243
I, i can't follow this
shitty storyline at all.

562
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,377
Wait!

563
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:18,316
Oh boy, that thing has really
got sand in its vagina.

564
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,352
The rune stone!
Face it towards geldan.

565
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,907
Ah, dude, lame.

566
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:27,551
Lame, bummer, dude.

567
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:29,160
What a stupid voice.

568
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:32,630
It's okay, the curse
has been lifted.

569
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:35,233
Yeah, we all gotta make sure
it doesn't come back.

570
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,968
You see, we've learned
something today.

571
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,137
Swearing can be fun,
but doing it all the time

572
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,837
Causes a lot of problems.

573
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,607
We're all saying
the "s" word too much.

574
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:43,908
Hey.

575
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:47,343
Look, gerald, kyle's on tv. Uh-Huh.

576
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,330
The knights of standards
and practices were created

577
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:51,282
To make sure that bad words
were kept to a minimum.

578
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,549
Curse words-

579
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,319
They're called that
because theyarecursed.

580
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,054
We have to go back to
only using curse words

581
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,789
In rare, extreme
circumstances.

582
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,958
Besides, so much use
of a dirty word

583
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:01,658
Takes away from
its impact.

584
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,428
We believe in free speech
and all that,

585
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,729
But leaving
a few words taboo

586
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,464
Just adds to the fun
of english.

587
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,164
So please, everyone,

588
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,802
From now on, you've got to try
and watch your language.

589
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,103
Yeah.

590
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,105
Yeah.

591
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,658
It makes sense.
Got that right.

592
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,141
Is this still
part of the show?

593
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,779
We're sorry, noble knights
of standards and practices.

594
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,381
From now on,
we will obey your laws.

595
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,081
See that you do.

596
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,816
I'm very proud
of you children.

597
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,454
Let's all go home and find a
nice white woman to make love to.

598
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,189
Yeah, and
kenny didn't die.

599
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,158
Yeah, i didn't-

600
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,058
Holy sh- Poop.

601
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,262
Ha, i love you guys.
