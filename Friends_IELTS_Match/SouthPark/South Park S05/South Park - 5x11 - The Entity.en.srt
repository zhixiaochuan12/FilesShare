Jesus christ!

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,272
These lines
are ridiculous!

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,972
I'm gonna
miss my flight.

17
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,176
Excuse me, there's two other
security check points.

18
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,911
Why can't you
open those too?

19
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:47,045
Duh, i dunno nothing.

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,647
But you work for the-
Goddammit!

21
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,418
Snooty airlines
announces the arrival

22
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,604
Of flight 239
from connecticut.

23
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,348
That's your
cousin's flight, kyle.

24
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,057
Hold the sign up
nice and high,

25
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,158
So he can find us.

26
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,190
What's he look like?

27
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,925
He's your age and
about your height.

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,262
I'm stoked my cousin
is coming to live with us.

29
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,997
It'll be just like
having a brother.

30
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:05,697
I thought i were!

31
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,202
Oh, there he is,
over here, kyle!

32
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,106
Hello, aunt sheila.

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,841
How was
your flight?

34
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,107
Oh, it was terrible.

35
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,842
They recycled
the air onboard,

36
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,612
And it really did
a number on my asthma.

37
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:20,914
I asked them to
turn up the oxygen

38
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,180
And they wouldn't.

39
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,083
You remember,
uncle jerry.

40
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,349
Hello, uncle jerry.

41
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,986
And these are your
cousins ike and kyle.

42
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,253
Hey, dude. Meet you.

43
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,457
Let's get down to
the baggage claim, kyle.

44
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:31,289
Okay.
Okay.

45
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,590
Oh, that's right!

46
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,892
We've got
two kyles now.

47
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,698
We'll just call you kyle
and you can be kyle... two.

48
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,800
Cool.

49
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:40,867
Next.

50
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,567
Oh, i feel like
i've run a marathon.

51
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,506
Okay, the 2:30 flight to
cheyenne has boarded.

52
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,772
It looks like you
didn't make it.

53
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,542
What- Well of course,
i didn't make it!

54
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,294
The line to check in
was two hours long

55
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:53,012
And the security line was
two hours more!

56
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,279
Yeah, no problem, though.

57
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,049
We'll get you on the 7:00am
flight tomorrow morning.

58
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,434
I can't go tomorrow
the jizzfest is tonight!

59
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,386
Would you like a window
or an aisle seat?

60
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,653
This is unbelievable!

61
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,507
You know, i seem to remember
when the airlines said

62
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,327
"We need a $15 billion bailout
from the taxpayers."

63
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,296
Mm, okay, have any of
your personal items

64
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,231
Been out of your
possession since you left?

65
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,983
Well, we gave them
the $15 billion

66
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,666
And they fired their
employees anyway,

67
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,737
So now we have three people
to clear 400 passengers!

68
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,056
Hey, he's right!

69
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:20,305
Yeah!

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,075
Okay, and your bags have
been with you at all times?

71
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,177
So where did
that money go?

72
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,244
I'll tell you
where it went!

73
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,510
It went right
into the pockets

74
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,280
Of the presidents and
c.E.O.S of the airlines,

75
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
So they can keep their
multi-Million dollar salaries!

76
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,715
Yeah!

77
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,485
And here's your boarding pass
for tomorrow morning.

78
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,786
You think you can treat us
however you want

79
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,487
Because we have to fly!

80
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,257
Well, i'll tell you
what, sally sass-A-Lot

81
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,293
I'm gonna come up with
a new mode of transportation.

82
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,993
A- A brand new vehicle

83
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,763
That will put all you
bastards out of business!

84
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,064
Yeah!

85
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,366
You think
i can't do it?

86
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,535
I've got a masters degree
in mechanical engineering

87
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,836
At denver community college.

88
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:50,938
You watch me!

89
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:51,970
C'mon everybody!

90
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,174
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

91
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,077
Can i get on that
7:30am flight?

92
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,548
Here we go kyle two,
and here's yours, kyle.

93
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,716
Wh-What is this?

94
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Mom's special stew.

95
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,319
She makes it every monday
and i love it.

96
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,585
Oh is this beef?

97
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,887
Yeah, dude,
it's great.

98
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,188
Actually,
i- I can't eat beef.

99
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,392
I have a degenerative problem
with my intestinal lining

100
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,127
And beef really
gives me gas.

101
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,662
Oh, i'm so sorry, kyle!

102
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,128
What else can
i fix you?

103
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,898
Oh no, i- I don't
wanna be a bother.

104
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,766
Nonsense!

105
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,501
Can't i make you
some nice pasta

106
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,767
Or a frozen
fish fillet?

107
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,405
Well, some fish would be great
if it isn't too much trouble.

108
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,574
I'll put it in the
microwave right away.

109
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,381
Mom.

110
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,648
Yes, kyle two.

111
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,984
How am i related
to him again?

112
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,285
He's your cousin,
kyle two.

113
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,552
I told you already.

114
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,154
Yeah, but like 1st cousin
or distant cousin?

115
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,792
He's my sister's son that
makes him your 1st cousin.

116
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,544
So we have
the same blood!

117
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,227
Now, kyle two,
listen to me.

118
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,431
Kyle is going through
a tough time in his life.

119
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,467
His mother is very sick, and
he's in a whole new place.

120
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,733
He's going to
rely on you

121
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,503
To make sure he
fits in at your school.

122
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,336
What!

123
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,672
How the hell am i
suppose to do that?

124
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,407
I'm sure your friends
will love him.

125
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,275
What about
cartman, huh?

126
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,793
He rips onme
for being jewish.

127
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,437
He's gonna tear
this kid apart.

128
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,046
Kyle two, is
your responsibility.

129
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:07,914
Oh my god!

130
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,432
I'm sure you
two will become

131
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,642
Great friends
with lots of

132
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:11,818
Late-Night
pillow talk.

133
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,084
What do you mean?

134
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,420
What room is he
sleeping in?

135
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,589
What's this comforter
filled with?

136
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,324
Oh, it isn't filled
with down, is it?

137
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,927
I don't know, dude.

138
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,529
It sure is quiet up here
in the mountains and dry too.

139
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,831
Do you have
a humidifier?

140
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think so.

141
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,735
Can you take my
stupid glasses

142
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,036
And put them on
the nightstand?

143
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,337
Make sure they're
close by

144
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,506
That fish upset my stomach,
and i might need them

145
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,675
If i need to go to
the bathroom later on.

146
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,278
Okay.

147
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,858
It's got to
be simple.

148
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,062
Like a moped but with
the ability to travel

149
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,196
At much faster speeds.

150
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,532
If the design of our
electrical moped

151
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,798
Were altered with-

152
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,002
No, no, no, no
this won't work either.

153
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,188
What was wrong
with that plan?

154
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,340
It has to be
more stable, mr. Hat.

155
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,509
A moped would be too
dangerous at those speeds.

156
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:10,775
Dammit!

157
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,545
Now what if the jet power
of an aircraft

158
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,449
Could be scaled down
into a personal vehicle.

159
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,317
Boy, that
enrique iglesias

160
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
Can sure gyrate
his hot ass around.

161
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,389
Oh, mr. Hat, will you
stop drooling

162
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,792
Over enrique inglesias' -

163
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,126
Wait, what did you say?

164
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,763
I said enrique inglesias
can sure gyrate his hot ass.

165
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,366
That's it!
Gyration!

166
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:35,066
A gyroscope!

167
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,836
It would allow for
maximum balance, and yet-

168
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:40,306
Mr. Hat,
you're a genius!

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,909
It's so simple
and yet genius!

170
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,078
Check out his
hot bulge, too.

171
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,778
Hey, dude.

172
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,645
What's that thing?

173
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,198
Cartman, i need
to talk to you.

174
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,682
Hello, i'm
kyle's cousin, kyle.

175
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,018
Cartman, i'm gonna
make you a deal. What?

176
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,187
That kid over there is
my cousin from the east coast.

177
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,488
He's having a really
hard time right now,

178
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,789
So i'm gonna
offer you $40

179
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,091
To not to
rip on him.

180
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:58,923
40 bucks!

181
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,259
But you can't make
fun of him at all.

182
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,561
No smartass
comments, nothing.

183
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:02,827
All right, all right.

184
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,597
And you especially can't
say anything about jews.

185
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,332
Oh jesus, why don't you
just cut off my balls!

186
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,032
Cartman,
no jew jokes!

187
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,369
All you have to do
is keep your mouth shut

188
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,236
And you've got
40 bucks.

189
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:12,804
Can you do it?

190
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,007
I can't believe how cold
it is out here.

191
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,176
It could be tough,
but i'll give it a shot.

192
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,443
All right.

193
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,213
...it's a real dry cold
that's the problem.

194
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,948
The cold air
makes me wheeze.

195
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,214
Kyle, this is cartman.

196
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,550
He's my sort of
friend- Ish.

197
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,852
Nice to
meet you, cartman.

198
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,322
I saw that same jacket
at bosco's for $29.95.

199
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:30,588
How much was yours?

200
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,358
I'm just wondering if
bosco's is a rip-Off.

201
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,460
Oh, man.

202
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:34,527
Cartman.

203
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,227
Ah, it's nice
to meet you kyle.

204
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,563
I can certainly tell
that you're a relative

205
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,298
Of my good friend
kyle, here.

206
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,769
What the hell
was that?

207
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,805
Well, what the
hell was that?

208
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,373
What the hell
was that?

209
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,709
I dunno, it was
going so fast

210
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:50,811
I couldn't see it.

211
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:52,880
But i want one.

212
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,914
Yeah, me too!

213
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,349
We've done it mr. Hat!

214
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,084
Airline companies
be damned!

215
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,156
We've invented a whole new
mode of transportation.

216
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,891
Get some investors
on the phone.

217
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,458
Well, what are
you waiting for!

218
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,963
...and i know you'll all be
very nice to our new student.

219
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,132
Kyle, why don't you tell us
a little about yourself.

220
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,434
Oh, well i grew up
in the city

221
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,168
I really don't
care for it.

222
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,435
I come from
a jewish family

223
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,554
Which, of course,
you already know

224
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,639
Because kyle's from
the same family.

225
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,241
I like to read,
and i have these polyps

226
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,560
On the backs
of my hands.

227
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,809
I don't know
what they are.

228
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,579
Oh my god,
i'm not gonna make it.

229
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,845
I'm not
gonna make it.

230
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,615
Oh, and i hope one day
to be an investment banker.

231
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,953
I- Must-Fight-It...
need-40-Dollars.

232
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,989
Okay, why don't you go ahead
and take a seat, kyle.

233
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,689
Where should i sit?

234
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,991
There's no place
to sit down here.

235
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,327
Yes, unfortunately
the school seems to be

236
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,628
Completely out of
extra desks,

237
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,797
So you'll just have to
share with your cousin.

238
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:45,630
What!

239
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,400
Oh, all right, then.

240
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,472
Now let's get on with
our lesson about the-

241
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,208
Are wooden desks all
that are available?

242
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:56,743
I usually prefer
the plastic ones

243
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,244
Because these
give me splinters.

244
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,510
Ugnh-Ughn!

245
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,847
I'm sorry kyle you'll
just have to make do.

246
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,148
Now let's get
back to the les-

247
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:02,980
Is it cold in here?

248
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,099
I realize we're
in the mountains,

249
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,184
But do we have to
freeze to death?

250
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,884
Now kyle i need you
to be quiet.

251
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,221
In my class, you need to
be able to concentrate.

252
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:09,487
Uhg!

253
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,124
Concentration is the key
to succeeding in my class.

254
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,293
Maybe we'll have to send him
to concentration camp.

255
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,462
Argh- Dammit,
dammit, dammit!

256
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,197
Cartman!

257
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,318
Kindergarten teacher
herbert garrison

258
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,235
Has apparently invented
a new vehicle

259
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,873
Which will give the airlines
a run for their money.

260
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,041
Mr. Garrison is putting
the final touches

261
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:29,909
On his top secret device,

262
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,078
Which he
simply calls "it."

263
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,212
So what exactly
is "it?"

264
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,198
Here with report
is a hispanic man

265
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,150
With some gravy stains
on his lapel.

266
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,152
Thanks, tom- Oh-
Thanks, tom.

267
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,356
So far herbert garrison
hasn't let anyone

268
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,622
Get a look
at his invention.

269
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,260
He claims that the vehicle
is so genius and revolutionary

270
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:49,446
That it could cause
one's eyes to bleed

271
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,597
If not properly prepared
to see it.

272
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,731
But earlier today,
hbc news got footage

273
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,369
Of some of the country's top
investors and richest people

274
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,405
Who have been invited
for a first look, including:

275
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,507
Steve forbes

276
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:01,574
Steve jobs

277
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,309
Ted turner

278
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,411
Donald trump

279
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,443
Bill gates

280
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,612
And yasmine bleeth.

281
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,249
They're curiosity is
piqued tom, and so is ours.

282
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,516
What is "it"?

283
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,251
What does
"it" do?

284
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,756
And when will "it" be somewhere
where i can buy one?

285
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,961
Reporting live
jeff ferrrrrrnando, hbc news.

286
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,997
You need to learn to play
some sports, kyle,

287
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,732
So we're gonna start with
a tough one called

288
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,999
"Catch the ball."

289
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,202
I throw the football to you,
you throw it back to me.

290
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,239
Oh, but isn't the cold air
making the ball really hard?

291
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,540
It's gonna
hurt my hands.

292
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,408
It's fine.

293
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,143
All right then,
h- How do i catch it?

294
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,409
It's a football dude.

295
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,480
You just put your
arms out and catch it.

296
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,951
All right,
here we go!

297
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,518
Now what?

298
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,854
Now throw it
back to me.

299
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,156
But it's down
in the snow!

300
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,023
So dig it out.

301
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,290
But i'll get snow
on my gloves

302
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,060
And then it will melt
and i'll have wet hands.

303
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,795
Well, then we'll
dry them off.

304
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,964
All right then.

305
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,065
Oh my god.

306
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,097
Kyle, kyle!

307
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,867
I just found out
that in world war ii

308
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,603
Some jewish people
were sent to

309
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,921
Concentration camps.

310
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:06,170
Yeah, they were cartman.

311
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,073
Oh you see i didn't
realize that

312
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,808
But i understand now
how you might've thought

313
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,074
What i said in
the classroom

314
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,844
Was a racial slur,
but see, i had no idea!

315
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,110
You did too!

316
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,412
You are so
full of crap.

317
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,483
No, i'm seriously, because
i was talking to craig

318
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:18,749
And craig was all like,

319
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,652
"Did you know
in world war ii

320
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,387
They really had
concentration camps?"

321
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,688
And i was all like,
"no way!"

322
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,388
And then this little light
went on in my head,

323
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,158
"Aw man, no wonder kyle
thought what i said in class

324
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,858
Was directed
at his cousin."

325
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,496
But-But i was literally talking
about a concentration camp

326
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,797
You know where you go
for a week to learn to focus.

327
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,834
Oh man, what a
misunderstanding, huh?

328
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:35,666
You blew
the deal, cartman.

329
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,003
Goddammit, give me
another chance!

330
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:37,870
Nuh-Uh.

331
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,822
I knew you were gonna
make fun of my lame cousin

332
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:41,340
So i offered you the
40 bucks not to rip on him.

333
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,075
You ripped on him-
Deal's off.

334
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,377
You did what?

335
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:45,209
Oh no.

336
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,545
Ha ha, serves you
right, asshole.

337
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,581
You-You paid your friends
to not make fun of me?

338
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,149
Look it's not because
anything's wrong with you.

339
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,655
Wow, you think it takes $40
to get people to like me.

340
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,355
Kyle, i'm sorry.

341
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,691
Because i really think
you could've done it

342
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,426
For about $12.50.

343
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,293
What?

344
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,029
I mean you didn't just
start at $40 did you?

345
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:04,330
You gotta low-Ball
these things,

346
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:05,631
So you have
a place to go.

347
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,668
Oh, dude!

348
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,235
Boy, it sure is
dry out here.

349
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,873
Gentlemen, imagine being
able to travel safely

350
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,007
At incredibly fast speeds

351
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,512
And not having to go to the
stupid fart-Face airports.

352
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:22,982
That sounds incredible,
mr. Garrison!

353
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,951
It is incredible,
mr. Hat.

354
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:27,020
And what makes
it possible is

355
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:30,006
"It's" patented
gyroscope design.

356
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,958
Gentlemen,
i give you... "it."

357
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,711
Ooh!
Oh! Ahhh!

358
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:36,429
Nice!
Sleek!

359
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,597
"It" gets over
300 miles to the gallon

360
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,935
And is safely capable
of speeds over 200 mph.

361
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,201
Wow!

362
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,503
This will change
everything.

363
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,238
We're going to have
to re-Think cities.

364
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,177
Now "it" is easily operated
using four flexi-Grip handles.

365
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,310
Two of them
are on each side.

366
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,598
Left side for throttle,
right side for steering.

367
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,852
The third flexigrip is
gently inserted into the anus

368
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,322
To keep the
driver in place.

369
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,094
Oh...
ew... hmm...

370
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,794
There we go.

371
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,997
Now the final flexigrip is
directly in front of the driver

372
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,034
So that small switches can be
operated with the mouth

373
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,769
As such...

374
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,107
Put the four together
and we're ready to go.

375
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,843
Oh my god!

376
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,613
Look at it go!

377
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,181
But the way it works,

378
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,517
Do you really think
people will

379
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:32,783
Go through
that to travel?

380
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,120
Hey, it still beats
what you go through

381
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:34,987
At the airports.

382
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,373
That's true.
Yep. True. Yep!

383
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,290
I can't take it
anymore, stan.

384
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,626
My cousin's been here
for two weeks

385
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,892
And he's driving me insane.

386
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,662
I know dude, every kid in school
wants to kick his ass.

387
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:44,929
I spent five years
in this town

388
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,230
Making a good name
for jews and this...

389
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,868
This stereotype shows
up and wrecks it all!

390
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:49,735
You know what my
biggest fear is?

391
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,435
That i'llbecomehim.

392
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,772
That somehow his mannerisms
will start rubbing off on me,

393
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,038
And i'll become
a stereotype.

394
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,242
I mean i'm a jew and
he's makingmehate jews.

395
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:57,074
Dude, a self-Hating jew-

396
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,844
Youarebecoming
a stereotype!

397
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,712
See!

398
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,013
I'm back.

399
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,279
Ah!

400
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,483
Later dude.

401
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,208
Tom, the day is
finally here.

402
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,908
"It" has arrived
for retail sale

403
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,112
And people are getting
their first look at "it."

404
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,847
Okay good,
just step through here...

405
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,016
And then this
is your steering,

406
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,317
And here's
your throttle.

407
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:40,017
Okay...

408
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,655
Okay, now your just
gonna feel a little pinch...

409
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,921
Arrgh!

410
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,257
It's all right,
it's just locking you in.

411
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,391
...take it.
Ahh!

412
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,161
Doing great kathy,
how's that ride?

413
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,427
Mmph-Mm-Mhmph!

414
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,499
Okay, now use your mouth
to operate the turn signals

415
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,535
And you're off.

416
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,343
Great, who else wants
to give "it" a spin?

417
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,982
Oh man, is
that the "it"?

418
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,248
Yeah.

419
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,550
How is "it"?

420
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,187
Well, it beats dealing with
the airline companies

421
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,356
That's for sure.

422
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,693
I don't know
about this, guys.

423
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,960
I think sleds
are dangerous.

424
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,730
Sledding is something
all kids out here do.

425
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:25,996
You gotta learn.

426
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,200
It seems like i might
get splinters, though.

427
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,501
Remember, just hold on.

428
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,104
No matter how long the
sledding run lasts, hold on.

429
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,707
Hold on, i see.

430
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,743
Oh jesus
the sled is going fast!

431
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,877
Hang on.

432
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,081
I have to
watch out for my-

433
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,215
Ow, ow, it's so cold
oh jesus!

434
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,985
How far do you think
it is to connecticut?

435
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,086
It's at least
a couple hours.

436
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,153
Think he'll
be all right?

437
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,255
He's fine.

438
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,524
Are you tired of
corporate airline companies

439
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,225
Treating you like
a worthless sardine?

440
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,428
Tired of ridiculous lines
and security at airports?

441
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,597
Well now there's an alternative
to airline travel,

442
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,297
"It"!

443
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,067
"It" has taken
the country by storm.

444
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,819
And already, 2 million
have been sold.

445
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,537
Never have another
important business trip

446
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,273
Ruined by airline
incompetence.

447
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:08,539
Hey, ladies!

448
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,309
How did you get to
the grand canyon?

449
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,514
It comes in sizes available
for the entire family.

450
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,382
Here you go, robbie.

451
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,082
Wahhhhhh!

452
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,383
Yo, i'm john travolta.

453
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,153
I used to rely on airlines
to get me to set,

454
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,888
But once i got used to "it",

455
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,840
I found "it" to be
a little less painful

456
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,358
Than dealing with
the airline companies.

457
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,527
I just power up
the flexigrips...

458
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:35,866
Ah, oh, ah, yeah.

459
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,371
And i'm ready to go-
Thank you, "it."

460
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,071
So join the millions
of americans

461
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,841
Who have found a little bit more
comfortable way of traveling.

462
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,108
Orders yours today.

463
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,396
"It" better than flying.

464
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:50,649
That looks pretty gay.

465
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,252
Kyle two,
where is kyle?

466
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,119
I don't know, mom.

467
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,421
Last time i saw him
he was sledding.

468
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,687
Where on earth
could he be?

469
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,457
You know it's possible he just
went back to connecticut.

470
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,723
Wh-What?

471
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,059
I mean, maybe he got
so worried about his mom

472
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,361
That he found a way to
get back and see her.

473
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,061
Don't be ridiculous,
kyle two!

474
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,796
He's out playing
with his new friends.

475
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,566
I'm just throwing it
out there as a possibility.

476
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,036
I'm back!

477
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,303
Ah!

478
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,856
I'm sorry, you must've
been worried sick.

479
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,374
I got your sled
tangled up with a bus.

480
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,074
A bus, really?

481
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,410
Kyle, what
happened to you?!

482
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,579
I was just sledding and
then the next thing i knew

483
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,314
My sled rope got
tangled with a bus.

484
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,448
I got dragged for
over 100 miles

485
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,218
Before the bus
finally stopped for gas.

486
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,187
I'm sorry about
your sled, kyle.

487
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,122
Oh no, don't worry
about it, dude.

488
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,388
You poor thing!

489
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,592
Come upstairs and we'll get you
out of those wet clothes.

490
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,858
Are you all right?

491
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,195
My ears feel like
they're frozen off.

492
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,461
And i think i have
a hemorrhoid

493
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,966
From sitting on the
sled for so long...

494
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,087
? We're in the
money, mr. Hand?

495
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,473
? We're in
the money, mr. Hand?

496
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,173
Oh hi jimbo,
can i help you?

497
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,377
Yeah, i wanted to order
that theft alarm for my "it".

498
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,979
Oh right, right,
take a seat.

499
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,245
That's okay, i'll stand.

500
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,582
What do you
think, mr. Marsh

501
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,751
All set to put
a down payment on that baby?

502
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,919
Well yeah, but i just
had one question

503
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,221
About the way
it works.

504
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,088
Sure!

505
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,257
Well, it seems
all the buttons

506
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,957
On these front
and rear flexigrips

507
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,161
Are also found on the
side of the vehicle.

508
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,427
Yep.

509
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,065
Well so, they don't
really do anything.

510
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,897
Right.

511
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,234
So then couldn't i just
order one that works

512
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:20,873
Without going in and
out of my ass and mouth?

513
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,308
Well, i guess youcould.

514
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,813
What? What's that?
What did he say?

515
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,381
I don't know
about this guys.

516
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,717
I think playing hide
and seek in the airport

517
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:32,983
Might be dangerous.

518
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,319
Kyle, we told you,
kids in colorado

519
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,621
All play hide and seek
at the airport.

520
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,922
Yeah, as soon as we
get to the concourse

521
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:38,241
You'll see how
fun it is.

522
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:39,490
This is taking
too long.

523
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,826
The flight to connecticut
is gonna leave.

524
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:42,526
Hey, can we speed
things up here?

525
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,597
Duh, sorry but ever since
that "it" thing came out

526
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,634
The airlines have had
to cut back on employees.

527
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:49,935
Dude, we're the
only ones here!

528
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,538
How long does it take to get
five people through security?

529
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,804
Duh, let's see...

530
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,743
Four people
plus, times, divided...

531
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,647
Two hours domestic,
three hours international.

532
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:05,117
Hide and seek at home?
Can't we just play no.

533
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:09,021
Ah-Ha, what's this-
A toenail clipper!

534
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:10,322
Die terrorist!

535
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,456
Wow, oh jesus!

536
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,660
See, we do these
checks for a reason.

537
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,262
This is ridiculous, come on!

538
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,769
Okay, cartman, you're
it, start counting.

539
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,504
1, 2, 3...

540
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,022
Here, kyle,
you hide in here.

541
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:28,107
In there?
It's very confined,

542
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,408
I'll get cramps
in my legs.

543
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:30,709
Just get
in the box!

544
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,409
All right then.

545
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,745
Oh, would you
look at that!

546
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,047
I've got a corn
on my ankle.

547
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,782
Where did that
one come from

548
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,751
That's the fourth
one i've had.

549
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,686
These corns are
killing me.

550
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,421
I hope he doesn't
suffocate.

551
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,253
He's fine.

552
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,023
Yeah, he'll be way
better off at home.

553
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,060
Oh jesus, this box
is going fast!

554
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:52,831
Oh, i did it again!

555
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,869
Excuse me!

556
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,604
What the hell
are you doing?

557
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,940
It's all right,
we're with the government.

558
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,242
We're just
shutting you down.

559
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,942
Shutting me down
why?

560
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,677
The airlines are
in desperate trouble

561
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,013
You're vehicle is causing them
to lose money.

562
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,182
Yeah, that was
the point,dingleberry-

563
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,448
Hey, put that down!

564
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,218
Right, so the government
is bailing out the airlines

565
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,821
By shutting you down
and making "it"s illegal.

566
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,224
Oh goddammit!
You better be kidding!

567
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,592
Sir, many people work
for the airlines

568
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,859
We can't let them
all be fired.

569
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,629
The airline companies
are losing money

570
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,930
Because of their
own incompetence

571
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,882
And their own inefficiency.

572
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,365
That may be true,
but if you

573
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,701
Build, sell, or ride
another "it"

574
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,870
It will be
the last time.

575
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,039
Have a nice night!

576
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,810
Arrrrgh,
airline mother -Ers!

577
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,281
You pieces of!

578
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,920
Oh, it's been days
where can he be?

579
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,186
I don't know, ma.

580
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,522
It's like he vanished
into thin air.

581
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,788
I'm going to call
the police again.

582
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,559
Kyle two, go down to the
playground and look there.

583
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:54,860
I already checked
the playground, ma.

584
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,161
I told you
he isn't really-

585
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm back.
Ahhh!

586
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,331
Kyle, you're back!

587
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,668
Yeah, it's the
craziest thing.

588
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,836
I hid myself on
a plane to antarctica.

589
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,439
Oh, it was so
dry down there.

590
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,142
So dude, did cartman's
idea work?

591
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,912
No, i tried getting my cousin
lost in the woods,

592
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,647
But a stupid bear
brought him home.

593
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,515
Damn!

594
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:17,816
Just have to face facts
that i'm gonna live with

595
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,117
My crappy cousin forever.

596
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,852
Well, kyle,
i- I gotta go.

597
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,553
What?

598
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,889
Yeah, i gotta get
back to connecticut.

599
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,624
Now that things have
changed for kyle,

600
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,925
His mother
needs him back.

601
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,192
Oh, do you promise!

602
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,962
I mean, oh that's
too bad, dude.

603
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,263
What changed for you?

604
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,432
Well, i-I invested
in that "it" thing,

605
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,698
And there was a bailout,

606
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
So i received a $5 million
bailout clause check,

607
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,637
Which i can use
to help my family.

608
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,337
So i-I guess goodbye, cousin.

609
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,408
Okay, see ya, cousin,
hope to see you soon.

610
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,710
Not too soon, i hope.

611
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:45,976
Yeah.

612
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,711
Five million dollars!

613
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,314
Dude, you have
five million dollars?

614
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,517
Yeah, but i don't know
what to do with it, though.

615
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,784
Well, see ya.

616
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,421
Wait, kyle
this may sound crazy...

617
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,156
But i think
you shouldstay.

618
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,041
Yeah! Yeah!

619
00:20:59,076 --> 00:20:59,891
Really?

620
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,592
Yeah.

621
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,795
You see, i've learned
something today.

622
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,832
Sometimes people have trouble
fitting in at school and um-

623
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,532
...what did i learn?

624
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,833
What did i
learn about...?

625
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,471
I learned that you shouldn't
judge somebody because that-

626
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:13,338
No, wait...

627
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,206
No, what were
you gonna say?

628
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,472
Listen, guys.

629
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,375
I appreciate you
wanting me around

630
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,977
But the fact of
the matter is... well,

631
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,146
You guys are just
kind of douche bags.

632
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:22,412
Wha?

633
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,050
I mean, you people are all just
such hick, jock, rednecks.

634
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,219
It's like you're right out of
a stereotype catalog.

635
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:30,689
I- I can't take it,
see ya!

636
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,942
Dude... weak.

637
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:35,894
Good job, jew!
