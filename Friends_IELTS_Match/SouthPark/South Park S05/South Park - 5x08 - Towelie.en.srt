? Humble folks
without temptation?

00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,549

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,718

to south park?

13
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,164
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,500
Ah, killed you.

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,402
I blew your
head off.

16
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:39,004
Jesus, is cartman
still in the bathroom?

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,306
Hey, cartman, we're
almost to level 20!

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,607
You giving birth
in there or what?

19
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,307
Let a man take a crap.

20
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,644
Dude, he's in there
punishing my toilet.

21
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,910
Yeah, that poor,
poor thing.

22
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,246
Come on, cartman,
you're missing the game!

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,946
I'm almost done,
you smart-Asses,

24
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,584
I'm just wiping my-
What the hell is that?

25
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,922
You guys, look what i found in
the trash can in stan's bathroom.

26
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,090
It's like a bloody cotton thing
wrapped in toilet paper.

27
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,790
Why did you pull it
out of the trash?

28
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,127
Because i thought
it was a jelly doughnut,

29
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,827
But look, check it out,
it's all bloody.

30
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,429
Are you boysstill playing
that video game? Yeah.

31
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:07,633
Hey, mom, cartman found a bloody
cotton thing in the bathroom.

32
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,900
Look.

33
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,635
But i don't think
it's for using,

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,971
I think it's just for
looking through.

35
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:12,803
Eric, put that down.
Why?

36
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,972
Just go put it back
in the trash can.

37
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,309
But it's like all bloody,
it might be alive.

38
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,044
No, that-
That came from me.

39
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,310
Just put it away.

40
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,611
This came out of you?

41
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,346
You just left it
in the trash can?

42
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,550
"You shouldn't have done that,
he's just a boy.

43
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,418
Poor little feller."

44
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:26,684
What is it, mom?

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,020
Yeah, what is it,
mrs. Marsh?

46
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:30,154
Boys, that's a...
feminine thing.

47
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,225
All right, it's a
personal woman thing.

48
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,492
I tell you what,

49
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,661
If you'll just drop the
whole thing right now,

50
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,298
I'll buy you that new video
game console you've been wanting.

51
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,033
The 2001
okama gamesphere?

52
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,733
Sure.
Cool!

53
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,371
Wow, this is like finding
trash can gold, you guys.

54
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,407
There it is,
the okama gamesphere.

55
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,010
Dude, it's got
128 gigahertz d-Ram.

56
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,276
What's that?

57
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,480
I don't know,
but it kicks ass.

58
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,251
Wow, dude, you're the
luckiest kid in south park.

59
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,952
Hey, this is
all of ours.

60
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,155
I'm the one who found stan's
aborted brother in the trash can

61
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,890
And blackmailed his mom
into getting the gamesphere.

62
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,192
All right, all right,
but you guys gotta see

63
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,927
If you can sleep over for
the rest of the weekend.

64
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,061
It's saturday at 2:30,
that means we have...

65
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,831
39 hours to play gamesphere
until school on monday.

66
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,132
Woo hoo!
Awesome!

67
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,433
Oh, crap.
What?

68
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,602
I'm supposed to go to the lake
with my family tomorrow,

69
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,903
And swim and play
in the stupid sun.

70
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:19,205
Dude, we got
gamesphere.

71
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,905
I know, i know.

72
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,109
Well, look, i'll stay over anyway
so i can play for... 18 hours.

73
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,644
And then i'll go
to the lake.

74
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,145
Don't forget to
bring a towel.

75
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,411
What?

76
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,146
When you get
out of the water

77
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,350
You need to dry off right
away to avoid catching a cold.

78
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,050
That's why
"towelie" says,

79
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,688
"Don't forget
to bring a towel."

80
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,525
Okay.
Thanks, towelie.

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,327
You wanna
get high?

82
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,328
No.

83
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,966
Anyway, that will give me plenty
of time playing video games.

84
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,135
Kyle, i think you underestimate
okama gamesphere.

85
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,887
Here you go, boys.

86
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,570
Aah!

87
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,305
Okay, turn it on.

88
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,942
Okama gamesphere!

89
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,643
Whoa!

90
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,245
Thirst for blood!

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,015
Oh yeah, "thirst
for blood", bring it.

92
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,883
Oh, this is so cool.

93
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,618
Bring it, bring it!

94
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,787
Fight, go!

95
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,955
Good night, boys,
don't stay up too late.

96
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,656
Good night, mom,
thanks for gamesphere.

97
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,293
Yeah, but you still "shouldn't
have done that, he's just a boy."

98
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,329
What?
Nothing, come on, randy.

99
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, mom,
i can't go to the lake.

100
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,500
No, stan's having
emotional problems

101
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,704
And we need to help see him through it, he's got
- What is it?

102
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,022
Date rape
psychosis.

103
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,332
"Date rape" something.

104
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,607
Yeah, okay,
i will.

105
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:29,874
Okay, thanks, mom.

106
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,210
I don't have to
go outside!

107
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,476
Awesome!

108
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,778
She said it's fine,

109
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,114
But that i still have to go to
baseball practice tonight.

110
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,849
Oh yeah, we've got
baseball practice today.

111
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,549
God damn it!

112
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,319
We shouldn't have this many
responsibilities, we're children.

113
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,054
It's all right, we can still
play for six more hours.

114
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,156
And then we'll go
play baseball.

115
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,223
Don't forget to
bring a towel.

116
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,524
Ah, no.

117
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,127
When you're playing sports the
sweat can get in your face.

118
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:49,393
That's why towelie says,

119
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:51,597
"Always keep an extra towel
in your duffel bag."

120
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,132
Okay, we will.

121
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,598
All right!

122
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,802
You wanna
get high?

123
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,104
No, we don't
wanna get high.

124
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,370
Okay.

125
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,671
You sure?

126
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,007
Yes, go away,
you stupid towel!

127
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,308
Oh, dude,
did you see that?

128
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,176
I cut off your face
and ate it.

129
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,213
That's so cool!

130
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,984
Okay, boys, that's it,
you have to go now.

131
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,250
No, no,
it's okay, mom.

132
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,454
We can't go to baseball
practice because kyle has cancer.

133
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,189
No, stanley,
it's monday morning,

134
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,491
You have to
go to school.

135
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,757
It's monday?

136
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,058
Oh, um, i'm sick. Me too.

137
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,828
No, you're not sick,
now get to school.

138
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,930
All of you.

139
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,348
But mom!
Go!

140
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:26,732
Ahh!

141
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,901
I can't believe we
have to go to school.

142
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,469
Yeah, real life is
so boring and stupid.

143
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,672
We just have to try and make
the day go as fast as possible,

144
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,841
So we can get back
to gamesphere.

145
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,143
Hello, boys,
how are you?

146
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,409
Fine.

147
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,011
Say, boys, this may
sound a little odd,

148
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:44,517
But have you seen a talking
towel around anywhere?

149
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,052
What, you mean
towelie?

150
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,518
Echo, this is garret.

151
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,156
I've got a code five at...
park county, colorado.

152
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,758
Code five,
park county colorado!

153
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,662
What, dude?

154
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,301
This is gonna be
one long-Ass day.

155
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,241
That was the longest
day of school ever.

156
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,711
Come on, hurry,
i bet we can get to level 29.

157
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,411
Where is it?

158
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,398
It, it was
right here.

159
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,350
Where the hell
is it?!

160
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,302
Come on, man,
this isn't funny,

161
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,821
I need my fix.

162
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,087
Hello.

163
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,291
If you ever wanna see your
okama gamesphere again,

164
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,026
You'll bring us
the towel.

165
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,344
What, who is this?

166
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:29,593
Just get the towel

167
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,797
And meet us at the
gas station outside of town.

168
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,063
Or else.

169
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,267
Okama gamesphere!

170
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,436
Don't hurt it!

171
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,702
What?

172
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:40,004
They've taken it.

173
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,641
They've taken our
okama gamesphere.

174
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,341
No... no!

175
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,111
What do you mean
they've taken it?

176
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:46,979
Oh, this isn't
happening.

177
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,582
This isn't happening!

178
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,117
Towelie!

179
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,583
Hey, towel!

180
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,450
Where the hell
is he?

181
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,787
Where the hell
could he be?

182
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,956
I don't know, the guy on the
phone thought we had towelie,

183
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,057
So now we gotta
find him.

184
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,089
What has this
world come to,

185
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,860
Where people can just take
your okama gamesphere?

186
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:02,595
Hey, maybe we better
do a towel call.

187
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,197
Herrrre-Gttt!
Herrrre-Gttt

188
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,463
That's a towel call?

189
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:07,800
This is hopeless, we're
never gonna find him.

190
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,066
Hey, wait a minute.

191
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,402
Towelie always showed up
to give us towel advice

192
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:11,704
When we said something
about water.

193
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,005
Hey, yeah.

194
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,475
Well, guys, let's go to
the swimming pool.

195
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,379
Ah, let's go
take a shower.

196
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,079
Let's go water-Skiing!

197
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,849
Don't forget to
bring a towel.

198
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,115
There he is!

199
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,319
Be sure to bring a towel
so you don't get all wet.

200
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,421
Come on, dude.

201
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,453
Where we going?

202
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:30,789
Just come on,
it's getting dark.

203
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,392
Are we gonna
get high?

204
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,344
Are you sure this is
where they said to be?

205
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,862
They said the gas station
outside of town.

206
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,465
Well, i'm gonna
get a little high.

207
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,783
Hold it!

208
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,032
Who's that?

209
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,537
Step away
from the towel!

210
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,671
There you are, towel.

211
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,875
We've been looking
all over for you.

212
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,575
If you ever
go to a hotel,

213
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,345
Be sure to bring
your own towel.

214
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,479
It isn't safe for you
out here, towel.

215
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,683
There are people out here
who mean to harm you.

216
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,852
Excuse me, can we have our
okama gamesphere back?

217
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,153
We just wanna
play video games.

218
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,419
Your what?

219
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:03,721
Ah, look dude,
we're on level 24,

220
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,057
About to cross into
the caverns of madness.

221
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,792
I don't know what
you're talking about.

222
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,527
You called us and said
if we brought the towel,

223
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,262
You'd give us our
video game back.

224
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,431
Oh my god,
it's a trap!

225
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,167
Cover, cover!

226
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:18,938
God damn it,
what now?

227
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:22,373
Run, towel!

228
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,010
Come on, they gotta have our
video game around here somewhere.

229
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,745
Where's the towel?

230
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,047
It can't be far.

231
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,747
Alvarez, you and mitchell
sweep left.

232
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,818
Ha, hurry, you must get
the towel back totynacorp.

233
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,987
Where is our
okama gamesphere?

234
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:35,854
Get the towel home.

235
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,589
They'll explain
everything.

236
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,125
Please, hurry.

237
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,591
Ah, god damn it!

238
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,927
Do you know wher
he's talking about, towelie?

239
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,530
Huh? Oh yeah,
back at the base.

240
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,796
It's a long ways away.

241
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,566
All right, we're gonna
have to use this truck.

242
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,301
Come on, guys.

243
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:51,869
Well?

244
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,170
They've gone, sir.

245
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,506
It's like they vanished
out of thin air.

246
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,374
Damn it!

247
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,976
I knew those boys were
protecting that towel.

248
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,145
They must have some
unexplainable bond with it.

249
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,314
Perhaps they're telepathically
linked to the towel, sir,

250
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,882
Like "e.T."

251
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,086
They could already be anywhere,
hiding out again.

252
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,821
No, the time for
being nice is over.

253
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,423
We must instigate...
plan "b".

254
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,725
You mean-?

255
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,991
Yes.

256
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,496
Destroy all towels within
a thousand-Mile radius.

257
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,333
Hey, do you love towelie?

258
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,404
Good, because towelie
merchandise is now available.

259
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,440
Be the first to show your
enthusiasm for towelie

260
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,609
With the all-New
"i love towelie" t-Shirt.

261
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,875
And if you don't
like towelie,

262
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,645
You can buy the
"i hate towelie" t-Shirt.

263
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,912
It's 100% cotton!

264
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,081
And available soon,
the towelie towel.

265
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,851
It comes with all your
favorite catch phrases.

266
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,985
You wanna get high?

267
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,056
So call now and order your "i love
towelie" or "i hate towelie" t-Shirt.

268
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,756

269
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,960
Supplies are limited, so order one of these great t
- Shirts right away.

270
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,599
Are we
getting close?

271
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,865
I think so.

272
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,166
A little more
gas, kenny.

273
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,468
How long has it been since
you've been back there?

274
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,671
I've been wandering around on
my own for the past few weeks,

275
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,708
You know, helping people out
with towel safety

276
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,877
And proper towel use.
It's important.

277
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,828
No, it isn't.
Is.

278
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,312
No, it isn't. Is.

279
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,516
Wait, turn down here,
it's down this dirt road.

280
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,251
Brake kenny, brake.

281
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,987
Maybe it's down
that dirt road.

282
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,974
Dude, don't you
remember where it is?

283
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:20,891
I can't remember,
it all looks the same.

284
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,962
Hold on, let me get high,
then i'll remember where it is.

285
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,240
All right,
so where is it?

286
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,940
Where's what?

287
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,242
Ah!
Ah! Ah!

288
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,446
The base where you're from
and our okama gamesphere is.

289
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,048
All right,
that does it.

290
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,314
Brake angrily, kenny.

291
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,518
Now listen, towelie, we've
just about had it with you.

292
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,386
Calm down.

293
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,338
That's it, you're not
getting high again

294
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,856
Until we have our
okama gamesphere back.

295
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,990
That's my last "j",
asshole!

296
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,194
I don't care, you better
remember where your base is.

297
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,362
Oh, man, why is it everyone
riding me today?

298
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,098
God damn it.

299
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,135
Kevin.

300
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,207
Don't forget to wrap the
potato salad in aluminum foil.

301
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,208
Kevin, is that you?

302
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,412
Harris,
breach, bang and clear!

303
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,279
Hello?

304
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,183
Oh my god!
Oh, no!

305
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,352
All right, it's clear,
it's clear!

306
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,498
Aah!

307
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,401
Go, go!

308
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,740
Get it!

309
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,042
What the-?

310
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:45,909
Throw it down!

311
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,547
Oh, all right, have your
way with me if you must.

312
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,716
Go on, fulfill your
sick pleasures.

313
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,053
All right, let's go.

314
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,187
Where you going?

315
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,957
This is where
you came from?

316
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,909
Yeah, i think so.

317
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,392
Oh, man.
What?

318
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,596
I am so high
right now.

319
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,199
I have no idea
what's going on.

320
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,670
Welcome home,
smart towel rg-400.

321
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:16,273
Uh, hi, is this where
our okama gamesphere is?

322
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,477
We're missing out on some
quality video game time right now.

323
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,212
Thank you for bringing him
to us, boys.

324
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,248
You see, this is not
an ordinary towel.

325
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,382
He is the rg-400
smart towel,

326
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,020
Designed with a computer chip
inside the terry cloth.

327
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,286
We don't care.

328
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,622
You see,
here at tynacorp,

329
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,756
Our goal was to make
the perfect towel,

330
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,827
A towel that would sense how
wet or dry the user's skin was

331
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,563
And fluff itself
accordingly.

332
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,263
Dude,
we don't care.

333
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,564
Towelie was our
greatest success,

334
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,733
Smart enough to beat
the average human at chess

335
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,937
And absorbent enough to soak up
even the toughest spills.

336
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,105
But then one day,
towelie got high

337
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,840
And just sort of
wandered off.

338
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,974
We-Don't-Care.

339
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,178
All we want to know is
who has our okama gamesphere?

340
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,479
Ah yes,
your video game.

341
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:57,516
I'm afraid that what we all
experienced was a trap.

342
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,216
They called you and
said to bring the towel,

343
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,853
And then they called us and said
they were bringing towelie back.

344
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,890
Their plan was to wipe us
all out with one fell swoop.

345
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,156
Who's "they"?

346
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,457
Why, the military.

347
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,228
You see, after towelie got high
and wandered off from here,

348
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,928
The military
got a hold of him.

349
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,999
They wanted to turn towelie into
a weapon of mass destruction.

350
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,300
Don't care, don't care, don't care.

351
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,252
Towelie was at
their base for months

352
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,330
As they tried to copy
his t.N.A.

353
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,670
But then, one day,
towelie got high

354
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:23,976
And just sort of
wandered off, again.

355
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,676
God damn it.
Can we please!

356
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,313
Just get back to playing
our video game, please?!

357
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm afraid not,

358
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,783
Because your okama gamesphere
is at their base.

359
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,952
Can you tell us where
that is, please?

360
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,555
You mean to go
right into their base?

361
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,821
Of course.

362
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,025
The entry code should still be
in towlie's memory banks.

363
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,628
You could sneak him in there
and recover his t.N.A.

364
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,761
Great plan!

365
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:48,267
Sir, sergeant masters and
buller reporting, sir!

366
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,533
Ah, yes.

367
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:52,170
Tell me, marine, did you
accomplish your primary goal?

368
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,437
Sir, yes, sir!

369
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,738
All towels
have been destroyed.

370
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,375
The smart towel is
no doubt eliminated.

371
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,943
Ah, and you're
quite sure of this?

372
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:04,316
Yes, sir, there isn't
a towel left within 100 miles.

373
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,751
Hmm, so perhaps then,
you can explain to me

374
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,822
Why we just got footage of the
towel returning to tynacorp?!

375
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,824
We-
Outsmarted us, sir.

376
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,028
Well i'm through
playing hide-And-Seek.

377
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,763
We've got
no other choice.

378
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,233
Prepare to blow up
all of colorado.

379
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,776
In a moment we will
be over the base.

380
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,476
This is the only way in.

381
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,113
Any attempts on ground would be
easily spotted by guard posts.

382
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,415
Okay.

383
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:38,583
I hate to send you
back in there, towelie,

384
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:41,620
But only you have their security
system in your memory banks.

385
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,090
That's all right, it's always
good to bring a towel.

386
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,391
Good luck, boys.

387
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,560
The fate of the world
is depending on you.

388
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,260
We're not doing it
for the world,

389
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,030
We're doing it for our video
game. God, are you deaf?

390
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,297
All right, boys,

391
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,633
When you drop from the
plane, cover and roll.

392
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,585
Go it?
Yeah.

393
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,103
Go, go, go, go!

394
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,346
Dude, i figured
what? It out.

395
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,948
If we can go in and get
the gamesphere in 30 minutes,

396
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,586
We could still be back at your house
playing video games by midnight.

397
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,189
So that'd be what, like, eight
hours we could play before school?

398
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,455
Seven and a half.

399
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,659
Hurry up,
stupid parachute.

400
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,732
All right, i think
we go over there.

401
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,503
Let's see...

402
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,336
No.

403
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,637
Come on, towelie,
the guy said

404
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,407
You had the security system
in your memory banks.

405
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,107
Hey, it's been
a long time.

406
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,226
You just have no
long-Term memory

407
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:39,311
Because you get high
all the time.

408
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,011
Don't preach to me,
fatso!

409
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,347
I can preach to you all i want
'cause you're stupid!

410
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,648
You're stupid!

411
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:44,950
Yeah, but
you're a towel.

412
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,084
You're a towel!

413
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,420
Just let me
get high.

414
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,022
I know i can remember
if i get high.

415
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:51,890
Oh, god damn it.

416
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,059
All right, fine, here's
your stupid lighter.

417
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,795
Hold on.

418
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,999
Wait a second.

419
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,638
That's it.

420
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,904
That's it?

421
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,108
Yeah, that's the melody
tofunkytown.

422
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,747
? Won't you take me down
to funkytown?

423
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,350
No, towelie,
the entry code!

424
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,885
For what?

425
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,351
God damn it,

426
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:23,555
I guess we're gonna have to
climb the stupid fence.

427
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,061
Let's look in here.

428
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,906
Kill me...

429
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,641
Kill me.

430
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,208
Oh my god, no!

431
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:48,280
Well, well, well,
look what the cat dragged in.

432
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,414
What are
these things?

433
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,051
Genetic copies we tried
to make with your t.N.A.

434
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,220
They didn't work
too well, i'm afraid.

435
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,955
Kill me.

436
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,089
Do you have our
okama gamesphere?

437
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,509
You did very well to get the
towel this far, boys.

438
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,895
I wonder, what did they
tell you at tynacorp?

439
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,498
That the big, bad government
wanted to genetically engineer

440
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,198
Towelie as a weapon?

441
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,402
Now let me tell you
the real story.

442
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,536
Oh god, don't care,
don't care.

443
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,041
Yes, we've been trying to make our
own genetic copies of the towel.

444
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,210
But only because
we had to.

445
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:22,547
You see, when we started
spying on tynacorp,

446
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,601
We discovered
a certain terrifying secret.

447
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,620
Go on, ask him
what terrifying secret!

448
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,188
What terrifying secret?

449
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,693
That tynacorp was making these towels
in order to take over the world.

450
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:37,295
We're never gonna play okama
gamesphere again, are we?

451
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,030
Don't you see
what genetically enhanced

452
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,199
Smart towels like these
are capable of?

453
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,767
You get out of the shower
and dry yourself off.

454
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,838
But even after you're dry,
the towel makes you more dry.

455
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,441
It keeps getting you
dryer and dryer.

456
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,707
Can you imagine it,

457
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,778
What it would feel like
to be way, way too dry?

458
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,249
I'll tell you something,
you don't want to know.

459
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,550
And i don't know.

460
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,250
And we don't care.

461
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,419
You've been double-Crossed
by tynacorp, kids.

462
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,490
They set this all up to get you
in here and take us down.

463
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,190
So, let me get
this straight,

464
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:09,394
Our okama gamesphere
is back at tynacorp?

465
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,363
Oh yes, it has been
all along.

466
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,298
Can i kill the
towel now, sir?

467
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,165
Go ahead.

468
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,866
No, wait.

469
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,503
Perhaps now, we can use
their own towel against them.

470
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,203
If these boys must
return to tynacorp,

471
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:22,840
Then we will launch a sneak
attack on tynacorp as well.

472
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,443
You boys can take the towel
to tynacorp's central core

473
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,612
And upload this encryption disk
into their system,

474
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,347
Bringing them down,
once and for all.

475
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,614
But we don't care.

476
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,950
What the hell is this?

477
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,216
The towel was supposed to
go in there

478
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:35,420
And then run its own
self-Destruct sequence.

479
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,172
The towel has a will
of its own,

480
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,890
It's learning...
compassion.

481
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,059
We don't have the manpower to
hold off the entire military

482
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,662
And stop those wonder boys
from getting to the core.

483
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,362
Then we have
no choice.

484
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,867
We'll have to test the new
prototype a little early.

485
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:59,277
Don't forget to
bring a towel.

486
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,985
All right, boys, take
the towel back in there

487
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,119
And say your mission
was accomplished.

488
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,323
Then upload this encryption
disk into their computers.

489
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,491
We're just going in to
get our video game back.

490
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,324
If anything goes wrong

491
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,094
Use this newly-Developed
photon rifle.

492
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,697
Photon rifle,
whatever.

493
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,167
Hello?

494
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,468
Hello, anybody here?

495
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,637
Welcome to the party,
boys.

496
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,372
Ahh!

497
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,710
Oh, boy!

498
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:35,614
So, you thought you could
outsmart us, did you, kids?

499
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,999
Yah, move,
move, move, move!

500
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,916
Don't make a move,
you bastards.

501
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,120
Bring the towel here, boys,
they can't shoot children.

502
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,723
Don't listen to them,
they lied to you before.

503
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,891
Oh yes, boys, obey
your government.

504
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,627
Or perhaps it's time
these boys knew

505
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,362
What wasreallygoing on.

506
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,964
Oh my god, look!

507
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,133
Our gamesphere!

508
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,868
Okama gamesphere!

509
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,568
Oh sweet, it still
saved our place.

510
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,206
You see, boys, i'm afraid
you were double-Crossed.

511
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,507
If they were the military,

512
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,676
Why wouldn't they just
attack us to begin with?

513
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,411
Because they're not
the military.

514
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,363
All right,
maybe we lied to you,

515
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,846
But it was to protect
your own skin.

516
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,050
We're a resistance group
pretending to be the military

517
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,750
To bring tynacorp down.

518
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,520
Whoa, check it out,
you guys, parachute level.

519
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,786
Sweet.

520
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,339
Then perhaps
we should show these kids

521
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,858
Who tynacorp really
is made up of.

522
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,762
Go on, tell them why you've
been making towels... zeitar!

523
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,364
Oh, there's gold,
get the gold, kenny.

524
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,631
Our planet was dying,

525
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,366
We had no choice
but to find a new one.

526
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,569
Manufacturing smart towels
was our way to spy on humans

527
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,269
And see how they lived.

528
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,438
And now you know the
horrible truth, boys.

529
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:38,943
Truth or no, your alien
murdering group is over.

530
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,077
Can you turn it up?

531
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,812
Boys, try to reach
the core override.

532
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,450
We've got no choice but to
try to take them all out.

533
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,258
I think i can get it
from here, boys.

534
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,993
What are you doing?
You'll kill us all.

535
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,162
Sorry, zeitar, didn't your
momma ever tell you?

536
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,764
Don't mess with
earthlings.

537
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,066
Whoa!

538
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,837
Hang on.

539
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,138
Kenny!

540
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,706
Ahh!

541
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,910
Oh my god!
Our gamesphere.

542
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,044
You've gotta move me
closer.

543
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,681
Hurry up, kyle,
this place is coming apart.

544
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,416
What are you doing?

545
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,585
Get away from me,
you evil towel.

546
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,320
Towelie,
listen to me.

547
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,489
Let them go,
drop them.

548
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,241
No way,
they're my friends.

549
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,924
They aren't your friends.

550
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,260
Humans have
ruined the planet,

551
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,562
Killed off their own
environment.

552
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,863
Their time is over.

553
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,598
It is the
towels' turn now.

554
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,864
I've almost got it.

555
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,634
You're going to
let them go, towelie,

556
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,636
Because i know
your weakness.

557
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,141
Here, you can reach it,
come on, towelie.

558
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,177
How long has it be since
you've had a nice burn, huh?

559
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,912
20, 30 seconds?

560
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,179
Oh, crap.

561
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,949
You're going to have to
choose between their lives

562
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:52,684
And getting high.

563
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:53,985
You asshole.

564
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,154
Towelie, don't let go of us,
you god damn towel!

565
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,455
Kyle's almost there.

566
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,058
Come, towelie,
make your decision.

567
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,192
I choose...

568
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,263
I choose...
both!

569
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,637
I got it!

570
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:15,240
Ahh!

571
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,577
Come on, guys, let's go
play video games.

572
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,711
All right!
Hooray!

573
00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:23,481
Oh, dude,
we finished level 50.

574
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,748
Awesome!

575
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,385
Oh, man, i have no idea
what's going on.

576
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,651
Check it out.

577
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:29,988
Now, we're going into the
secret underground base.

578
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,254
All right guys, focus,

579
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,024
Looks like this is gonna
be an underwater level.

580
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,158
Don't forget to
bring a towel.

581
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,362
You're the worst
character ever, towelie.

582
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,097
I know.
