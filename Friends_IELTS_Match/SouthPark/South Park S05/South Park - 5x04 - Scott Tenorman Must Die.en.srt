00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,702
We don't wanna
see them, cartman!

35
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,535
There, see?

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,738

00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,342
Scott tenorman-
The ninth grader?

42
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:20,546
Yep, he let me have 'em
for just 10 bucks.

43
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,379
Ha, ha, ha!

44
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,932
? I got pubes

45
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,576

you guys?

46
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:26,150
? Ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha?

47
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,354
Cartman, you are so goddamn
stupid, it's unbelievable.

48
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,054
Ah, ha,
don't be jealous, guys.

49
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:32,258
This doesn't mean
we can't still hang out.

50
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,427
It just means that i
matured faster than you.

51
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,127
You'll get your
pubes, guys, someday.

52
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,331
Cartman, you don't buy pubes,
you grow them yourself.

53
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,597
Wh-What?

54
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,499
When you get
old enough,

55
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,234
You grow your own pubic hair
that's attached to you,

56
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:43,536
You dumb-Ass!

57
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,670
Nah-Ah.
Yeah-Huh.

58
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,175
But then why would scott tenorman
sell me his pubes for $10?

59
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,441
Because, retard,

60
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:54,380
You're dumb enough to buy
scott tenorman's pubes for $10.

61
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,549
You're telling me these pubes
are worth nothing?

62
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,815
Yeah.

63
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,453
I'm gonna get that
son of a bitch.

64
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,153
...and so i told him,
i say,

65
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,055
"Here, i'll sell you my pubes
for only 10 bucks."

66
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,755
And the stupid
asshole buys them.

67
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,176
Speak of the devil,
what do you want?

68
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,562
Uh, yes, i've come to
return these pubes

69
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,429
That i purchased, please.

70
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,129
Unh-Uh, i don't
take returns.

71
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,767
Right, but you see, i didn't realize
when i bought these pubes from you,

72
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,467
That you were
full of,

73
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:17,803
So you can either
give me back my $10

74
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,937
Or i can go
tell my mom on you.

75
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,442
You would actually tell your mom that you
were stupid enough to pay for my pubes?

76
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,761
Unh-Uh,
i don't think so.

77
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,045
Just give me back
my money.

78
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,912
Buyer beware, dude.

79
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,214
Give me my $10, scott.

80
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,914
Hey, i said no.

81
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,250
Now get your fat little butt
out of here

82
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,419
Before i kick
your head in.

83
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,793
Hello, sir, my name is
kris kristofferson.

84
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,493
I'm with the i.R.S.

85
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,131
I'm here to collect $10
that you owe in back taxes.

86
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,432
You're not
from the i.R.S.

87
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,433
You glued my pubes
onto your face.

88
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,203
Tax evasion is a very
serious offense, sir.

89
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,938
I suggest that you-
All right, all right.

90
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,674
I'll trade you my pubes
back for the money.

91
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,374
You will?
Oh, cool!

92
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,577
How much did i charge?
Oh, yeah, $10.

93
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,312
You got change
for a 20?

94
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,013
Oh, uh...

95
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,650
I only got six dollars
and 12 cents.

96
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,784
Oh, well, that's okay.

97
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,554
Here, just give me
the six dollars

98
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,289
And then i'll give you the 20. Okay.

99
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,892
Now, give me the pubes and
i'll give you back two dollars.

100
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,158
Right.
Now, give me the 12 cents

101
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,362
And i'll give you the
rest of your change back.

102
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:17,628
Cool.

103
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,531
And then give me the 20 and
i'll give you the pubes.

104
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,665
Sweet!

105
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,302
Uh- Ah, godammit!

106
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,037
That asshole.

107
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,772
That big, smelly,
ass-Sniffing asshole.

108
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm gonna get him!

109
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:28,941
Cartman, can i give you
some advice?

110
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,207
What?!
Just let it go, dude.

111
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,713
You're only out $16.12-
Count your losses and move on.

112
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:34,979
He's smarter than you.

113
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:35,881
He is not
smarter than me!

114
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,148
He just charmed me,
that's all.

115
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,484
He's a charmer,
that scott tenorman,

116
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,653
But i'll get him someday.

117
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,520
One, please.

118
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,038
One, please.

00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:46,292
One please.

120
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,364
That'll be six dollars.

121
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,401
Okay, and how much
is that in pubes?

122
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,101
We don't take pubes.

123
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,836
Listen, my money is as good
as anybody's, don't you-

124
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,907
Discriminate against my people
by not accepting these pubes.

125
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,510
We don't take pubes,
end of story!

126
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,245
Racist!

127
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,813
Scott, scott!

00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,884
She's all drunk

And showing her
"poonaner" to everybody!

131
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,354
You gotta go check it out!
I'll watch your house for you.

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,655
Okay, i'll buy

I'll even throw in
an extra five, here.

00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,427
Give me back my pubes.

136
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,596
Why do you want them
back so much?

137
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,331
No reason.
I don't believe you.

138
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,597
All right, all right.

139
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,367
The pube fair
in fort collins.

140
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,200
Pube fair?

141
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,536
They're paying five bucks
a hair for pubes.

142
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,705
If i leave now i can
catch the last bus.

143
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,537
Five bucks a hair?

144
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,307
That's like
a million dollars!

145
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,175
Here, take your money.

146
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,344
Ha, ha, i don't
think so, scott,

147
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,079
I'm going to
fort collins myself.

148
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,464
Oh, you can't
do this to me, no!

149
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,416
Ha, ha, sure,
right you are, scott.

150
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,984
Have you no heart?

151
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,188
Ha, ha, what

152
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:50,923
Heh, heh, heh.

Woo! Ah!

155
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,201
Ha, ha, ha.

156
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,502
Heh.

157
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,805
Eh, excuse me, sir.

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,575
Can you tell me where

159
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,407
The pube fair?

160
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,709
Yeah, i've got some
pubes to sell.

161
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,780
There's no such thing,
you little smart ass.

162
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:16,914
No- No such thing?

163
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,684

106 miles, scott.

168
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,939
I had to ride 106 miles in
the back of a pickup truck

169
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:40,806
To get back here.

170
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,940
You really went?
What a 'tard.

171
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,276
All right, scott,

172
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,543
You do?

173
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,879
Wow, you're not as
stupid as i thought.

174
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,145
Yeah, i'll see you around.

175
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,783
Sure is too bad
about my grandmother.

176
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,049
Your grandma?

177
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,253
Huh? Oh, it's not
really your concern,

178
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,856
It's just that
- Well, my grandma is in the hospital.

179
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,556
She's very sick.

180
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,627
The doctor's say unless i can
come up with $16 for her operation

181
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,327
They're gonna
put her down.

182
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,398
Oh, jeez,
i didn't realize that.

183
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,098
Yeah, poor grandma.

184
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,736
Hey, kid,
hold on a second,

185
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,339
I'll get your money.

186
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,039
Heh, heh, heh.

187
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,110
He's such a douche.

188
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:18,943
Here you go.

189
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,678
Oh, wow, thanks
a lot, scott.

190
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,882
But, just one thing
before i give it to you.

191
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:23,714
What?

192
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:27,219
I just- Well,
i want to you beg for it.

193
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,485
Huh?

194
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,822
Just get down on your knees
and beg me for the money.

195
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,088
Why?!

196
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,257
Do you want your grandma
to live or not?

197
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,810
Please, scott,
give me my money.

198
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,328
No, no, get down
on your knees.

199
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,330
Lower your head...

200
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,401
And say, "i beg you to
give me back my money."

201
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,570
I beg you to
give me back my money.

202
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,739
Now say,
"i'm a little piggy."

203
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,708
What?!
Say it.

204
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,608
I'm a little piggy.

205
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,811
"Here's my snout."
Here's my snout.

206
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,414
"Oink, oink, oink."
Oink, oink, oink.

207
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,752
Now, dance, little piggy,
dance and oink for me.

208
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,222
? I'm a little piggy,
here's my snout?

209
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,041
? Oink, oink, oink
oink, oink, oink?

210
00:07:06,076 --> 00:07:08,392
? I'm a little piggy-?

211
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,728
All right, now
give me back my money!

212
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,428
You mean this?

213
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,632
You really care that much
about 16 measly dollars?

214
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,332
I mean, what can you
buy with $16?

215
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,102
My parents give me
a $50-A-Week allowance.

216
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,837
This pittance means
nothing to me.

217
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,537
Watch.

218
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,741
Wh-What are you doing?

219
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:27,044
No, no... why?

220
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,682
Now you can't bug me
for your dumb money.

221
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,237
Concerned citizens,
i thank you for coming.

222
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,773
I know that you're all
deeply troubled

223
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,239
And want to find
a quick and painful way

224
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,443
To get rid of scott tenorman
once and for all.

225
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:58,709
Yes, clyde.

226
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,611
Who's scott tenorman?

227
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,347
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

228
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,515
Scott tenorman is an 8th grader
who sold cartman his pubes for $10,

229
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,817
And now cartman's
all pissed off.

230
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,986
16 dollars
and 12 cents.

231
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,252
He is a disease.

232
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,588
He is a cold,
calculating man,

233
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,323
And i will have revenge!

234
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,624
What are you
gonna do?

235
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,576
Did you guys see that
movie, "hannibal"?

236
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,095
Where the deformed guy
trained giant pigs

237
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,361
To eat his enemy alive?

238
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,432
Well, if we find a pony,
we can train it,

239
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,469
Train it to bite off
scott tenorman's wiener.

240
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,505
It will be painful
and humiliating.

241
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,771
Everyone will
see it happen.

242
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,975
And then, scott tenorman
will forever be known

243
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,012
As the kid who had his wiener
bitten off by a pony!

244
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,278
Ha, ha, ha!

245
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,614
What's in it for us?
What?

246
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,915
Yeah, why should
we all care

247
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,217
About getting scott
tenorman back for you?

248
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,819
Oh, right.
Why should we care?

249
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,953
Why should we
care, indeed.

250
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,807
Let's just let scott tenorman
walk away with my $16.12.

251
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,627
Hell, let's let all the
scott tenormans of the world

252
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,162
Take what's ours and
laugh in our faces.

253
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,663
Why stand up for yourself
when you can just

254
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,399
Walk out of here
right now and say

255
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,099
It's not your problem.

256
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,736
But, years from now,
when you're old

257
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,436
And have children
of your own,

258
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:02,290
What would you give to come back
and fight this one day?

259
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,110
This one day, where you could
have made a difference.

260
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:08,147
Where you could've told scott
tenorman, "you may take our pride

261
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,617
But you will never take
my god damn $16.12!"

262
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,918
Now who's with me?

263
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,653
Timmy!

264
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,353
Christ.

265
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,123
All right, i guess it's
just you and me, timmy.

266
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,292
Oh, no, not timmy.

267
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,330
There we go.

268
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,499
Come and get it!

269
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,570
Come on, pony,
bite the wiener.

270
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,704
Bite it.

271
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,474
Come on, good pony.

272
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,341
That's it.

273
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:37,608
Now, bite it off!

274
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,378
Bite off the wiener,
good pony!

275
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,980
Oh, no, pony,
he'll like that.

276
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,583
Eric, are you training
that pony to please you?!

277
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,752
No, i'm teaching it how to
bite someone's penis off.

278
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,619
Oh.

279
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,788
Well, does mr. Jenkins know
you're using his pony?

280
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,957
He shoots trespassers
on sight, you know.

281
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,059
He said it was okay.

282
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,126
All right, then.

283
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,295
Wait- What the hell are you
training jenkins' pony

284
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,698
To bite off
someone's penis?

285
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,031
Because...
of scott tenorman.

286
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,634
I hate him, and i want to
make him suffer.

287
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,838
Well, son, i think you've got
a pretty stupid plan there.

288
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,538
Not like that, pony!

289
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,175
Look, if you wanna get
revenge on somebody,

290
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,344
You've gotta
think like a hunter.

291
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,610
What do you mean?

292
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,779
Find
someone's weakness.

293
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:18,200
Exploit that weakness.

294
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:20,586
How do i do that?

295
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:30,094
What do you see?

296
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,829
I see scott tenorman,

297
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,599
With his ginger red hair
and his stupid freckles,

298
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,785
And god damn it,
i hate him, i hate him!

299
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,936
No, young hunter,
i mean, what do yousee?

300
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,105
You must learn all you can
about your kill.

301
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,641
Right, right.

302
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,142
Let's see...

303
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,842
There's posters,
radioheadposters.

304
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,612
And he's reading a magazine
about radiohead.

305
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,312
What's a radiohead?

306
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,648
You know, the band
that sings that song.

307
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:53,118
? Well, i'm a creep
i'm a weirdo?

308
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,287
? What am i doing here?

309
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,987
Oh, jesus, don't
start singing, ned.

310
00:10:57,022 --> 00:11:00,023
So, the subject is a big
radiohead fan, huh?

311
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:02,227
Maybe i should come up
with a lit'l scheme

312
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,060
That involves them.

313
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,396
Nice thinking,
young hunter.

314
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,264
Whoa.
What?

315
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:06,998
I'm looking in
scott's parents' room.

316
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,300
Scott's mom's about to
take off her bra.

317
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,566
What?!
Give me those!

318
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,301
Holy crow,
he's right, ned!

319
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,071
Mrs. Tenorman's
lettin' the twins out.

320
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,373
Let me see.

321
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,940
Radiohead...
yes, of course.

322
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,144
Dear god, they're even bigger
than i ever imagined!

323
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,844
Let me see,
let me see!

324
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,831
Here you go.
Wow, those were great.

325
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,692
Maybe i should
grab some beers, ned.

326
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,518
Ned, what-
Are you jackin' it?

327
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,121
Kinda.
Well, stop it!

328
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,025
Hey, what the hell are you
doing out there?

329
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,857
Oh, crap!

330
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,159
Who's out there?

331
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,495
Ned, for christ's sakes,
stop jackin' it.

332
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,327
I can't.

333
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,062
Don't think
i don't see you!

334
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,399
I know who you are,
and i'm calling the police!

335
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:41,665
Whoa!
Whoops!

336
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,869
I gotta get
out of here!

337
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,773
Oh, hey, scott,
how's it going?

338
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,473
I was just wondering,

339
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,677
Do you like the band, uh,
radiohead at all?

340
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,943
Uh-Huh.
Oh, really?

341
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,546
Oh, 'cause they're doing
a big interview onmtv,

342
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,183
And they're playing it tonight
on a big screen downtown.

343
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,449
Everyone's gonna be there.

344
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:02,521
Oh, cool,
thanks for telling me.

345
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,690
You're welcome, scott.

346
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,027
Okay, well, looks like
everyone is here,

347
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,630
Let's play the video,
shall we?

348
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,799
Welcome back to mtv.

349
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,933
We're here with the
members from radiohead,

350
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,703
Probably the hottest band
in the world right now.

351
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,270
Guys, when is your next
album coming out?

352
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:22,040
That's an interesting
question, kurt.

353
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,740
But first
i'd just like to say,

354
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,510
That i really hate this kid
named scott tenorman.

355
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,777
He's stupid.

356
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,113
Yeah, i hate scott
tenorman, too.

357
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,716
I think all the guys in the band
hate him, right, guys?

358
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,451
Oh, jesus, did you
hear that, scott?

359
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,151
And, will there
be a new tour?

360
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,656
Well, we would tour, but we just
hate that scott tenorman kid so much

361
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,922
That we don't want to.

362
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,126
Yeah, scott tenorman
is totally not cool.

363
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,427
He's not cool.

364
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,596
Wow, that really sucks
for you, scott.

365
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,730
Scott?

366
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Did you see that?

367
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,669
Scott must've run home
so embarrassed.

368
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,369
Ha, ha, ha!
And you know what?

369
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,139
That wasn't really
radiohead talking,

370
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,525
I just dubbed their
voices over.

371
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,442
Ha, ha, ha!
What a retard!

372
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,044
And everyone saw it!

373
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,682
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

374
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,302
It's time for the
amazing pube boy!

375
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:08,913
? I'm a little piggy
here's my snout?

376
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:11,490
? Oink, oink, oink
oink, oink, oink?

377
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,562
? I'm a little piggy
here's my snout?

378
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,238
Oh my god,
he killed kenny.

379
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,504
That does it.

380
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,009
I'm gonna get scott tenorman
once and for all!

381
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,214
You think you're so cool,
scott tenorman.

382
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,251
We'll see how cool you feel
after this.

383
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,420
Yes, yes...

384
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,155
Yes!

385
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,192
Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha.

386
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,396
Yes, it is the most
genius plan ever.

387
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,866
Scott tenorman is going to
wish he never met me!

388
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,839
Okay, cartman,
what do you want?

389
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,158
Stan, kyle,
thanks for coming.

390
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:03,251
I've got it all
figured out.

391
00:14:03,286 --> 00:14:04,274
Got what all
figured out?

392
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,044
How to get
scott tenorman back.

393
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,311
Oh, jesus.

394
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,081
I've just finished planning
a "brilliant lit'l scheme"

395
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,781
That should put scott
in his place for good.

396
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,286
And if you help me, i'll give
each of you two dollars.

397
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,986
Okay, so what's
the plan?

398
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,190
It's a brilliant combination
of my last two plans.

399
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,359
Scott's favorite band
is radiohead, right?

400
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,625
Yeah?

401
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,926
So, i realized,

402
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,130
What if we got radiohead to
come here to south park, right?

403
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,299
Then they could meet
scott tenorman,and,

404
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,203
See him get his wiener
bitten off by a pony!

405
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,337
What?
Don't you see?

406
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,974
If i can get this pony to bite off
scott's wiener in front of radiohead,

407
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,674
Then scott would cry.

408
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,444
And if scott cries,
then radiohead will think

409
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,578
Scott tenorman is
totally not cool!

410
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,348
And that would make
scott tenorman want to die.

411
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,614
Ha, ha, ha!

412
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:45,951
Okay, i'll keep
working on the pony,

413
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,252
You guys go get
radiohead to play here.

414
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,421
Ready? Break!

415
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,856
You're such a
dumb-Ass, cartman.

416
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,494
Fine, i'll do it myself!
You guys just watch!

417
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,530
Ready, pony?
Bite it!

418
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,133
Yes!

419
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,169
Thom, will you stop
reading fan mail?

420
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,036
We have work to do.

421
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,772
Just a second, fellas,
listen to this.

422
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,905
"Dear radiohead.
My name is eric cartman,

423
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,844
"I'm a young, supple 8-Year-Old
boy from south park, colorado.

424
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,013
"I'm writing to you
because of a kid i know

425
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,713
"Named scott tenorman.

426
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,351
"Scott is 15, and
i'm afraid he has cancer.

427
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,918
"In his ass.

428
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:24,521
"Radiohead is his favorite band,
and it would make his short life

429
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,894
"If you could find it in your hearts to
visit him before he dies, alone and scared.

430
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,195
"Won't you please
consider it?

431
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,966
I don't think he'll make it past
next tuesday around five."

432
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,666
Wow, we have to go.

433
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,870
To colorado?
But we've got an album to mix.

434
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,570
Didn't you hear
the letter?

435
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,642
This poor kid has cancer!
In his ass!

436
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,209
Hello?

437
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,545
Scott tenorman?

438
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,812
What do you want?

439
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,582
We just wanna warn you,
eric cartman, the 4th grader,

440
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,450
Is going try to
trick you somehow

441
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:53,184
Into getting your
wiener bitten off

442
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,486
By a pony that lives at
jenkins ranch.

443
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,353
How do you know?

444
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:56,655
'Cause we're his friends.

445
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,390
Then, why are you
telling me?

446
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,656
'Cause we hate him.
Oh.

447
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,992
Well, we just thought
we'd let you know.

448
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:01,860
See ya.
See ya.

449
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,330
Hello, scott.
Hey.

450
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,366
I was just stopping by to invite
you to my "chili con carnival".

451
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,101
It's a chili cook-Off
with rides.

452
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,802
Everyone's coming,

453
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,439
And i wanted to drop by
your invitation, personally.

454
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,740
Ooh, a chili
carnival, huh?

455
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,441
That sounds great.

456
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,078
Yeah, there's even gonna
be a big surprise

457
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,778
So you won't wanna
miss it, scott.

458
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:26,151
Oh, and here, here's a coupon
good for one free pony ride.

459
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,851
Wow, a pony ride, neat.

460
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,621
Oh, it will be
very neat, scott.

461
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,790
Gosh- Chili,
rides and ponies-

462
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,091
What more could i want?

463
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,826
A little penis-Biting,
perhaps.

464
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,092
What?
Nothing, nothing.

465
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,429
So you'll come
for sure then, scott?

466
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,832
How could i
turn it down?

467
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,200
Sweet, killer.
Bye, scott.

468
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:46,104
Oh, you are good, eric,
you are very, very good.

469
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,140
Mom, dad, that was my good
friend eric at the door.

470
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,893
He told me that there's
a starving pony

471
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,611
At jenkins ranch
that's been abandoned.

472
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:53,877
Oh, dear.

473
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,612
Yeah, i feel really bad,

474
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,913
But i don't know
how i can help it

475
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,117
Because i have a lot of
homework to do.

476
00:16:59,152 --> 00:16:59,985
Well, don't you
worry, scott,

477
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:01,685
Your mom and i can
go get the pony

478
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,021
And have it taken to
an animal shelter.

479
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,721
We sure can.

480
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:05,624
Wow, would you really?

481
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,324
I feel so much
better now.

482
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,528
Oh, scott, you're such
a loving, caring boy.

483
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:11,228
I'm so proud of you.

484
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,564
I'm proud of
you too, mom.

485
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,166
Let's go, hon.
Let's.

486
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,734
What are you
doing, scott?

487
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,637
What's it look like?
I'm making chili.

488
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:19,938
Did you bring
the goods?

489
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,638
We got everyone we could find
to chip in.

490
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,842
There's pubes from just about
every kid in town in here.

491
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,143
Awesome.

492
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,444
Oh, dude!

493
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,578
The little fat kid thinks he's
gonna get revenge tomorrow.

494
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,782
We'll see how he likes it when
i tell him he just ate the pubes

495
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,951
Of every kid in town.
Yeah!

496
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,961
Oh, hello, guys, thanks for
coming to my chili con carnival.

497
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,147
This is the dumbest thing
you've ever done, cartman.

498
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,299
Oh, it won't be so dumb when
scott tenorman arrives.

499
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,467
I suggest you stay
to see the fireworks.

500
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,769
Oh, we will.

501
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,938
Trust us, we wouldn't
miss this.

502
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:54,204
What's so funny?

503
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,071
Oh, nothing,
it's just cool

504
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:56,408
How you're gonna get
scott tenorman back.

505
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,709
Is radiohead here yet?

506
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,010
Not yet,
but they will be.

507
00:17:59,045 --> 00:17:59,843
Yeah, sure.

508
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,578
Hello, eric.
Hey, chef.

509
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,348
I made some chili to
enter into the contest.

510
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,614
What contest?

511
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,167
This is a chili cook-Off,
ain't it?

512
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,686
Huh? Oh, yeah,
i guess it is.

513
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,421
Here, just put it
over here.

514
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,156
It's my
special recipe.

515
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,856
Scott tenorman!

516
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,361
How are you, scott?
Thanks so much for coming.

517
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,530
Oh, i wouldn't miss
this for anything.

518
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,230
Likewise.

519
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, come on, you've
got to see the pony.

520
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,266
Just a second.

521
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,001
Don't you wanna
taste my chili first?

522
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,736
Well, yeah, but there's
a special guest coming

523
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:29,808
And i want you to be near
the pony when they arrive.

524
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,343
Well, i don't want it
to get cold.

525
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,844
I think i can win
first prize.

526
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,880
All right, scott, let's go
over to the judging table

527
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,616
And we'll try the
chili first.

528
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,218
God damn it.

529
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,688
All right, i guess we should
taste each other's chili, huh?

530
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,990
This chili looks
pretty good.

531
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:46,291
Here's mine.

532
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,195
Mmm, i don't know,
your chili is good, cartman.

533
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,930
But i think mine
is better, try it.

534
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,532
All right.

535
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,256
Hey, this is great!

536
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,208
It's a special recipe.

537
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,593
God, this is
really good, scott.

538
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,510
I'm glad you
like it so much,

539
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,847
Because now that
you're almost finished,

540
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,582
I have something
to tell you.

541
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,282
What?

542
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,486
You mean about how you
put pubes in your chili?

543
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,186
What?!

544
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,257
Yes, i'm afraid this
isn't your chili, scott.

545
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,391
I switched it
with chef's.

546
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,595
It's delicious, chef.
I hadn't planned on that.

547
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,896
What i did plan on,
however,

548
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,631
Was that my friends
stan and kyle would betray me

549
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:30,535
And warn you that the chili
con carnival was a trap.

550
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,836
I assumed that
they would tell you

551
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,404
That i trained jenkins'
pony to bite off your wiener.

552
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,475
What they didn't tell you was
that jenkins is a crazy redneck

553
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,210
Who shoots
trespassers on sight.

554
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:42,246
Knowing that you would go and
try to do something to the pony,

555
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,849
I warned mr. Jenkins that violent
pony killers were in the area.

556
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,818
I also knew that you
wouldn't go yourself

557
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,670
For fear of having
your wiener bitten off.

558
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,453
You would most likely
send your parents.

559
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,958
And. I'm afraid that when mr.
Jenkins spotted them on his property

560
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,561
He shot and killed
both your parents.

561
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,200
Well, they was trespassin'
and i was protectin' myself.

562
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,466
I have my rights.

563
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:06,069
My... mom and dad
are dead?

564
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,405
I came just in time to see

565
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,008
Mr. Jenkins giving his report
to officer barbrady,

566
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,309
And of course
to steal the bodies.

567
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,213
After a night with the hacksaw,
i was all ready

568
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,913
To put on my
chili con carnival.

569
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:19,984
So that i could tell you personally
about your parents' demise.

570
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,552
And of course,
feed you your chili.

571
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:25,155
Do you like it?
Do you like it, scott?

572
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,660
I call it...
"mr. And mrs. Tenorman chili".

573
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,865
Oh, my god!

574
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,468
Oh, my god!

575
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,504
? Nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah?

576
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,823
? I made you
eat your parents?

577
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,107
? Nyah, nyah, nyah,
nyah, nyah?

578
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,709
Jesus christ, dude!

579
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,312
My mom and dad
are dead!

580
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,481
No, no!

581
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,215
Ah, excuse me?

582
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,083
Who are you?

583
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,384
We're that band,
radiohead.

584
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,987
Jeez, what a
little crybaby.

585
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,156
You gonna cry
all day, crybaby?

586
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,856
You know,
everyone has problems,

587
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,060
It doesn't mean you have to be
a little crybaby about it.

588
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,326
Come on, guys,
let's go,

589
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,061
This kid is
totally not cool.

590
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,265
Yeah, that's the most
uncool kid i've ever met.

591
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,434
Little crybaby.

592
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,603
No, wait!

593
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:13,303
Wait!

594
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,940
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

595
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,508
Yes! Yes!

596
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,928
Oh, let me taste
your tears, scott.

597
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,314
Mmm, your tears
are so yummy, sweet.

598
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:25,917
Dude, i think it might be best for
us to never piss cartman off again.

599
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,183
Good call.

600
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:29,821
Oh, the tears of
unfathomable sadness.

601
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,388
Mmm, yummy,
yummy, guys.

602
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,592
Yibbidy-Bip-
That's all, folks!
