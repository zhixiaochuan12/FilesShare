00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:16,549

14
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,570
And so, in her career
filled with lies, back-Stabbing

15
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,270
And whoring herself
for money,

16
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,005
She learned that
the price of fame can be

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,727
Pleasing 65 men at once
in a dark, dirty alley.

18
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:48,414
And so endspunky brewster:
behind the blow.

19
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:49,282
Whoa,
bummer, dude.

20
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,017
Okay, dude,

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,185
It's time for

Yay!

23
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,354
Excuse me, buddy.

24
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,222
Why, did you fart?

25
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,089
Oh, no!

26
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,391
Oh man, this is
another rerun.

27
00:00:58,824 --> 00:00:59,692
Are you sure?
I haven't seen it.

28
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,861
Yeah, fatass, this is their
famous "mechanic" sketch.

29
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,127
I'm looking
for a mechanic.

30
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:04,862
Can you tell me how to
get to the auto garage?

31
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,500
Sure, buddy, all you need
to do is go down to the-

32
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:11,802
And that's how you-

33
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:13,104
"Get to the auto garage."

34
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,308
Could you tell me how to get to
the auto garage without farting?

35
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,008
Sure, you go the same way,

36
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,778
"Except stick your finger
up your ass."

37
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,044
No, no, no.

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,248
I mean could you tell me the
directions again without you farting?

39
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,514
Oh, sure.

40
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:24,850
Just stick your finger
up my ass.

41
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,551
All right,

42
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,188
Now tell me, how do i get to the
auto garage to see a mechanic?

00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,357
You're at the auto garage,
i am the mechanic.

44
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,526
Why the heck didn't you tell me
you were the mechanic?

45
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,393
"Because i had
an itch up my ass."

46
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,128
Because i had
an itch up my ass.

47
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,936
Terrance and phillip
will be right back...

48
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,202
After these messages.

49
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:46,938

As you know,

00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,616
Oh!

00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,819

00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,554

Hello, children, i know

00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,760
About having the earth day
brainwashing festival

78
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,460
Put on in your town.

79
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,097
You care very much
about the earth, don't you?

80
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,364
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

81
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,665
Good, because
it's up to all of you

82
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,869
To get lots of people to come

83
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,569
The festival is on friday,

So we'll start getting it ready

85
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,039
What?

86
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,208
We've all gotta
pitch in.

87
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,978
I'm sorry, but the four of us
can't help tomorrow night.

88
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,513
Yeah!
Yeah!

89
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,014
You... what?

90
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,617
We got tickets to see terrance and
phillip live in denver tomorrow night.

91
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,918
We paid 40 bucks a piece
for them.

92
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,521
And terrance and phillip are
more important than mother earth?

93
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,787
Well, yeah, dude.

94
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,956
You don't care about
terrance and phillip.

95
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:17,196
Nothing matters more than saving
the planet from republicans.

96
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,365
You don't need to see
terrance and phillip.

97
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,534
No, dude,
we really, really do.

98
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,668
Their will is strong.

99
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,305
Boys, i'm sorry, but nothing's
more important than earth day.

100
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,005
Uh, but that's why
we're going. Huh?

101
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,643
See, we're the official presidents
of the terrance and phillip fan club

102
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,343
And we're going
to see them tomorrow

103
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,113
'Cause we can get them to
perform at the earth day festival.

104
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,282
You can get terrance
and phillip to perform?

105
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,548
That would be great.

106
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,752
Terrance and phillip would
draw huge ratings

107
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,452
From children
all over the country.

108
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,222
Very well, kids, we'll work
on getting the event ready here

109
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,957
And you go get
terrance and phillip.

110
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:45,825
All right!
All right!

111
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,525
But i warn you,

112
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,295
You better not promise things
to earth day people

113
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,561
That you can't deliver.

114
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:55,367
Earth day people can be
very unforgiving.

115
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,705
Heh-Heh, no problem,
no problem.

116
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,742
Ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,947
Put your hands together
for terrance!

118
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,417
Hello, denver!

119
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,755
Wow, dude,
terrance got really fat.

120
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,021
Yeah, he looks terrible.

121
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,225
How are you all feeling tonight,
pretty good?

122
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,658
Uh-Oh.

123
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,129
Hey, do you all
remember this one?

124
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,731
"Doctor, doctor,
i think i cracked my ass."

125
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,466
Phillip,
"let me take a look."

126
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,334
"Look closer."

127
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,769
Uh...

128
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,105
Where the hell
is phillip?

129
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,805
Phillip, phillip!

130
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,009
Phillip, phillip,
phillip, phillip!

131
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
And now, for some classic
terrance and phillip comedy.

132
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,431
Hello, terrance.

133
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,481
Hello, phillip.

134
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,383
Phillip?
That's not phillip.

135
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,552
Say, phillip,
i have a question for you.

136
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,287
Okay, shoot.

137
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,323
Dude, what the hell
is going on?

138
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,859
Why'd they
replace phillip?

139
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,325
I think this
new guy's funny.

140
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,529
And now here's a classic
terrance and phillip sketch

141
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,229
That i wrote
back in '62.

142
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,866
Excuse me, sir,
do you know who farted?

143
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,699
He sure did.

144
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,035
What's the person's name?

145
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,735
Who.
That farted?

146
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,071
The person
who. That passed gas?

147
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,338
Who passed gas.

148
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,674
Now, why you
askin' me?

149
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,192
That's man's name.

150
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,277
That's whose name?

151
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,977
Yes!

152
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,530
Something very terrible
has happened

153
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,048
In the world of
terrance and phillip

154
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:16,916
And we've got to
find out what.

155
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,084
Look, buddy, all i'm trying
to find out is,

156
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:20,785
What's the guy's name
that farted?

157
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,555
What's the guy that
drank his own urine.

158
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,856
Who?

159
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,194
Come on, guys, we're getting
to the bottom of this.

160
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,460
Excuse us.

161
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,579
Where do you think
you're goin'?

162
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:31,664
We have to talk
to terrance.

163
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,965
Yeah, right.

164
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,700
It's okay,
we're the official presidents

165
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,966
Of the terrance and
phillip fan club.

166
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:39,905
Then get in the "official president
of terrance and phillip fan club" line.

167
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,642
Oh, dude, gay.

168
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,978
You don't understand, we saved
terrance and phillip's lives once.

169
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,147
You and about a thousand other
people at one time or another.

170
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,882
Now get outta my face.

171
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,148
Redneck!

172
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,883
Man, this sucks.

173
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,653
Are you guys official
presidents too?

174
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,920
Don't talk to us, kid.

175
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,655
Hey, look at that line,
it's way shorter.

176
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,859
I don't think we're female
groupies or random sluts.

177
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,559
Kenny's a random slut.

178
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,329
Well, maybe we can sneak in
over there, come on.

179
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,064
Shh.

180
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,499
Yummy.

181
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,668
It was so great
meeting you.

182
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,438
I feel like we really
shared something.

183
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,173
We sure did, betty.

184
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,474
Next!

185
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,378
Hello, terrance,
i'm such a huge fan.

186
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,078
You're a huge fan,
all right.

187
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,414
Could i just have you
sign my breasts?

188
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:24,149
What do i get in return?

189
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,416
Whatever you want.

190
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,186
Oh yeah,
oh, that's good, baby.

191
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,355
Oh, terrance,
i love you, i love you.

192
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,306
I love you,
i love you.

193
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,825
Man, it smells
down there.

194
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,525
Jesus christ,
that was fast.

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,295
Well, what should we name it,
how 'bout jerry?

196
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,596
What the hell?

197
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,898
Oh wow,
we had quadruplets.

198
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,164
Aah!

199
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,465
We're not quadruplets,
terrance.

200
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,235
We snuck in that woman's
spandex to get in here.

201
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,501
Oh, thank god.

202
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,803
The last thing i need
is more kids.

203
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:46,705
What do you want,
an autograph or something?

204
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,007
No, it's more important
than that.

205
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,175
Our school is putting on
a big show for earth day

206
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,911
And we promised people
we could get you to perform.

207
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,177
Earth day, huh?

208
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,513
That sounds like
a very noble cause.

209
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:55,814
How much does it pay?

210
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:56,682
But where's phillip?

211
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,948
Who?

212
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,250
Phillip,
your partner.

213
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,803
Why is it that every time
somebody sees me,

214
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,447
They have to say,
"hey where's phillip?"

215
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,021
Like we're freakin' married
or something.

216
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,225
Y'know, i'll let youtater tots
in on a little secret.

217
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,491
Phillip is a hack.

218
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,261
You know who wrote all
the terrance and phillip stuff?

219
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,961
Me.

220
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:12,298
Phillip never did anything
but read his lines.

221
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,599
But the guy that
replaced him sucks.

222
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,600
I know,
i know he sucks.

223
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:20,070
To be honest, things haven't
been going so well lately.

224
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,708
I'm not making any money because
everyone wants to see phillip.

225
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:23,974
Why?

226
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,276
What the hell does
phillip do?

227
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,046
Because, dude,
it's "terrance and phillip".

228
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,312
Whatever.

229
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,047
The point is,
phillip and i are through

230
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,083
And apparently, so is the
act and so is the money.

231
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,287
What if we can get phillip
to agree to get back together?

232
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,588
Will you do
the earth day show for us?

233
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,324
Ha, good luck
getting phillip.

234
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,926
He left because he wanted
to do "more serious stuff."

235
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,529
The last i heard he was doing
canadian shakespeare in toronto.

236
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,795
Toronto?

237
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,565
But we promised the earth day
people you'd perform.

238
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,831
Well, in that case,

239
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:51,337
I'd say you four boys are
up fart creek without a paddle.

240
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,274
Work, work, children.

241
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,044
We only have two more days
until earth day, work!

242
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,046
Uh, excuse me,
my daddy is a geologist

243
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,683
And he says there actually
isn't any concrete evidence

244
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,950
Of global warming.

245
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,021
That's not true, global warming
is going to kill us all.

246
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,623
The republicans
are responsible.

247
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,359
Thank you.

248
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,830
Oh no, dude.

249
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,131
Oh, there you are boys.

250
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,468
I need terrance and
phillip's information

251
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,769
So i can tell them
their schedule.

252
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,504
Uh, we didn't
get them.

253
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,770
You what?

254
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,107
They're not together
anymore, dude.

255
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,373
You better be joking.

256
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,143
We've already announced
their participation.

257
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,409
Look, we could
probably get terrance,

258
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:33,746
But he'll be performing
with this other guy.

259
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,879
You promised us
terrance and phillip.

260
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,083
We, therefore, promised
the world terrance and phillip.

261
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,120
You will get us
terrance and phillip or else.

262
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:42,386
But there's nothing
we can do.

263
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,687
Phillip is doing
shakespeare in canada now.

264
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,325
Then you better get your asses
to canada and get him.

265
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,025
We'll make
travel arrangements.

266
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,229
Nothing is more important
than the environment, boys,

267
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:53,230
Not even your lives.

268
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, guys, i guess
we're going to canada.

269
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,735
Sweet.

270
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,675
Ah!

271
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,013
Part them,
they are incensed.

272
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,279
Nay, come again.

273
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,581
Look to the queen
there, buddy.

274
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,351
They bleed on both sides,
how is it, my lord?

275
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,183
How is it, laertes?

276
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,387
Why, as a woodcock
to mine own springe, osric,

277
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,122
I am justly killed with
my own treachery.

278
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:17,990
How does the queen?

279
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,291
Hey, guy,
she swoons to see them bleed.

280
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,327
Oh my dear, hamlet,
i am poisoned.

281
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,798
Oh, villainy,
ho, let the door be locked.

282
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,064
Treachery, seek it out.

283
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,051
It is here, hamlet,
hamlet, thou art slain.

284
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,912
No medicine in the world
can do thee good.

285
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,738
In thee there is not
half an hour of life.

286
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,473
The treacherous instrument
is in thy hand,

287
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,173
Unbated and envenomed.

288
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,943
The foul practice
hath turned itself on me.

289
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,112
Lo, here i lie
never to rise again.

290
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,281
Thy mother's poisoned,
i can no more.

291
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,016
The king,
the king's to blame.

292
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,751
The point,
envenomed too.

293
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,920
Then, venom
to thy work, buddy!

294
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,620
Treason, treason! Treason!

295
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,607
Oh, yet defend me, friends,
i am but hurt.

296
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,684
Here, thou incestuous,
murderous damned dane.

297
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,727
Drink of this potion,
is thy union here?

298
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,560
Follow my mother.

299
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,631
He is served, it is
a poison tempered by himself.

300
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,600
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble hamlet.

301
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,535
Mine and my father's death
came not upon thee

302
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,403
Nor thine on me.

303
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,005
Heaven make free of it,
i follow thee, guy.

304
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,007
I am dead, horatio,
wretched queen, adieu.

305
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,211
You that look pale and tremble
at this chance, buddy,

306
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,946
Thou are but mutes or
audience to this act,

307
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,416
Had i but time- As this fell sergeant
death is strict in his arrest-

308
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,585
Oh, i could tell you, buddy,
but let it be.

309
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,120
Horatio, i am dead.

310
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,586
Thou livest, guy,

311
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,790
Report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.

312
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,056
Never believe it.

313
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,609
I am more an antique roman
than a dane.

314
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,093
Here's yet some
liquor left, buddy.

315
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,730
Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ,
is this thing ever gonna end?

316
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,333
He has my dying voice, so
tell him with the occurrence

317
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,068
More and less which
have solicited,

318
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,202
The rest is silence.

319
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,056
Now cracks a noble heart,
good night, sweet prince

320
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,876
And flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest, buddy.

321
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,142
Phillip, phillip!
Yes?

322
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,346
Our town in colorado was chosen
to host earth day this year

323
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:48,647
And we need a big act.

324
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,948
Oh really?

325
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,117
This run of hamlet is closing down,
i'm afraid, we could take it there.

326
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,817
Uh, well we were thinking
how cool it would be

327
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,587
If you and terrance got
back together for a reunion-

328
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,889
Stop right there!

329
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,925
I'm not doin' nothin'
with that fatass egomaniac.

330
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,792
But we need you.

331
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,528
I'm sick of him
taking credit for all the work

332
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,829
And not letting me
change the act.

333
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,529
It's old and stale.

334
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,299
I mean, do you really think that
fart jokes are funny for that long?

335
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,902
Look, if you don't come
and do the show,

336
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,203
I'll make you
eat your parents.

337
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,070
Yeah,
whatever kid.

338
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,588
He'll do it, dude.

339
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:14,673
Uh, look, phillip.

340
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,408
Everyone in south park just
wants to see your serious side.

341
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,674
What?
What?

342
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,444
They told us, "that phillip,
he's the one with talent.

343
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,746
Just get him for earth day."

344
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,012
Really?

345
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,348
Well that sounds interesting,
how much does it pay?

346
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:24,866
$2,000.

347
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:25,916
I'm in!

348
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,554
Here, call me at this number
with the details, gotta run.

349
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:29,855
Dude, you didn't tell him
terrance would be there.

350
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,555
I didn't say he wouldn't
be there, either.

351
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,108
Look, all we have to do
is get them there, right?

352
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:34,626
Once terrance and phillip
get together again,

353
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,760
It'll be like old times.

354
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:40,265
Oh, kyle, you just made a huge
withdrawal at the "first bank of lies".

355
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,868
It'll,
it'll be okay.

356
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,737
Work faster.

357
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,676
Faster, children,
earth day is coming.

358
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,376
Well, boys,
it's rehearsal time

359
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,580
And your terrance and phillip
haven't shown up.

360
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:55,447
They said they'd come.

361
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,147
I'm sure they'll
be here any minute.

362
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:59,785
Maybe you kids don't understand
how important earth day is

363
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,086
For the future of our planet.

364
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,255
Maybe you need
some convincing.

365
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,140
Karl.

366
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:04,955
Ahh!

367
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,256
Oh, my god!

368
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,026
Excuse me, is this where the
earth day crap is happening?

369
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,293
He's here.

370
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,496
Oh, very good,
mr. Phillip, i'm jack forest,

371
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,763
Head of the earth day
committee.

372
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,533
Thank you for being a part
of this important event.

373
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,799
Whatever,
where's my check?

374
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,569
All right, i'm here,
where do i-

375
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,269
What's he doing here?

376
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,571
All right,
let's do a rehearsal

377
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,208
So that the camera crew
can get a look at it.

378
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,980
Wow, isn't this great, you guys
seeing each other again?

379
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,715
Yeah, you must have
a lot of catching up to do

380
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,547
But let's rehearse first.

381
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,317
So, this is your doing,
huh, terrance?

382
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,017
My doing?

383
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,787
These kids called me
and said it was your idea

384
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,054
And that you wanted
to apologize.

385
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,041
Please, you guys,
this is for earth day.

386
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,993
You care about mother earth,
don't you?

387
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:42,693
Well, what the hell?

388
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,428
I already flew
all the way out here.

389
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,198
But i want my check made out
to me, not both of us.

390
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,516
Ditto!

391
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,765
Fine.

392
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,102
See, i told you
it would work.

393
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,271
All right, we'll come off
the speech of the dying whales

394
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:54,404
And then, action.

395
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,741
Doctor, doctor,
i've cracked my ass.

396
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,476
Really?
Let me take a look.

397
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,343
Look closer.

398
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,416
Yon fart doth smell
of elderberry sweet-

399
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,116
That's not
the line, asshole.

400
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,452
You're right,
it's a better one, asshole.

401
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,152
Just do the bit right,
dick face!

402
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,356
Why don't you go eat some more
pudding, you fatass drug addict!

403
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,525
I may be fat, but at least
i didn't get hair plugs.

404
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,393
That's it!

405
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,526
I ain't doin' nothin'
with "kooko the whale"!

406
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:18,730
I never needed you in
the first place, you hack!

407
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,298
You can't leave,
the show starts soon.

408
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,237
Boys, you've got three hours
to get those two back together.

409
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,406
Do i need to remind you
what will happen if you don't?

410
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,291
Karl!

411
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,106
Owww!

412
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,659
You bastards.

413
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,142
Good luck, boys.

414
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,478
We've got to get them
back together, you guys.

415
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,647
They could
do this tous!

416
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,853
Tom, i'm standing in
south park, colorado

417
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:44,456
Where earth day 2001
is in full force.

418
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,425
Environmental awareness
games, booths

419
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,360
And of course,
the entertainment on stage

420
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,529
Which is being broadcast live
all over the country.

421
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:53,999
This eco-Happy crowd is thrilled
and waiting in anticipation

422
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,968
For the arrival
of terrance and phillip,

423
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,903
Who were promised
by these four boys.

424
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:01,338
What a touching
and true song.

425
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,843
You know it's true, republicans
are ruining the earth.

426
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,012
Republicans are
ruining the earth.

427
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,278
All right.

428
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,482
Well, i think i know why
most you tuned in today.

429
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,651
How about some
earth day entertainment?

430
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:19,157
Hooray for the earth,
we must protect it.

431
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:26,531
And now, as promised, here are
terrance and phillip... on video.

432
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,533
On video?

433
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,472
They were considered the best
comedy act in all of canada,

434
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,857
But a fast-Paced rocket ride
to success

435
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:38,802
Would bring them
to the depths of despair.

436
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,713
This isterrance and phillip:
behind the blow.

437
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,581
Wow.
Wow. Wow.

438
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,281
What the hell
do you call this?

439
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,016
Behind the blow.

440
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,317
I taped it last month.

441
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,521
We promised people
terrance and phillip,

442
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,787
Not a video documentary.

443
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:53,859
You've ruined the earth
for the last time, boys!

444
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,461
Aah!
Aah!

445
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,497
Terrance was born
"terrance henry stute"

446
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,666
In the small canadian village
of toronto.

447
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,353
At a very early age, his parents
noticed an uncanny musical ability

448
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:08,607
And decided to enroll him in the
canadian school for gifted babies.

449
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:12,077
It was here that he partnered up
with phillip niles argyle,

450
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,812
A brash young baby
from montreal.

451
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,414
Together,
they performed musical acts

452
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,583
That stunned canadians
everywhere.

453
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,885
At the tender age of six,

454
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,053
Terrance and phillip
were off to the united states

455
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,222
To perform on
theed sullivan show

456
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:26,825
Where american audiences
would be exposed to canadians

457
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,525
For the first time.

458
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,826
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

459
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,429
We have two adorable boys
from canada.

460
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,500
Please put your hands together for the
music of young terrance and phillip.

461
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,369
? Beef and lamb
chicken and ham?

462
00:15:39,404 --> 00:15:40,705
? Step to the left
and clap your hands?

463
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,024
? Gosh we love that
chicken and ham?

464
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,273
? Don't you love that
chicken and ham?

465
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,344
Oh my god, what's wrong
with their heads?!

466
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,513
It's all right, darling,
they're just canadian.

467
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,346
Oh.

468
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,682
? Beef and lamb
chicken and ham?

469
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:51,983
? Step to the left
and clap your hands?

470
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,718
? Gosh we love that
chicken and ham?

471
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,985
? Don't you love my
chicken and ham?

472
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,189
The canadian act confused
american audiences,

473
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,889
But then something happened

474
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,092
That would change terrance
and phillip's act forever.

475
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,239
It was the birth
of canadian comedy.

476
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:19,311
Terrance and phillip spent the next
several years perfecting their art

477
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,913
And meeting some of america's
most influential people.

478
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,516
Excuse me, which way
is the bus station?

479
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,251
Hey, you're the guy
on the screen.

480
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,552
What?

481
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,155
But it was in 1974
on thesonny and cher show

482
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,191
That terrance and phillip finally
started to mix their canadian humor

483
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,325
With deep political insight.

484
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,095
You know, cher,
a lot of us real americans

485
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,847
Don't know much
about canada.

486
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,591
Well, all of us
real americans

487
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,764
Aren't as stupid
and short as you.

488
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,868
Please, put your
groovy hands together

489
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,506
For the young and talented
terrance and phillip.

490
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,843
Say, terrance,
i'm getting worried aboot

491
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,379
All these russians
making missiles.

492
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,880
Maybe we should
stop this "cold war".

493
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,181
Here's a missile for ya.

494
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,783
That's better.

495
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,194
With this bold mix
of humor and political insight,

496
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,796
The world couldn't get enough
of terrance and phillip,

497
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,965
But their fame
would come at a price

498
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,151
Whenbehind the blow
continues.

499
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,268
Okay, okay,
i think we lost 'em.

500
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,038
Jesus, man, those earth people
don't screw around.

501
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,573
Kyle, none of this
would be happening

502
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,039
If you hadn't lied
in the first place.

503
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:25,026
You lied and then you lied
to cover up your lies.

504
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,943
I didn't see you complaining
at the time, fat boy!

505
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,581
Guys, we have no choice,
we're gonna have to move away.

506
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,316
Environmental activists
don't use logic or reason.

507
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,919
There they are!

508
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,052
Ahh!

509
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,389
Run, run, run!

510
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:39,689
As they entered
their late teens,

511
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,459
Terrance and phillip
were already starting to taste

512
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,194
The sweet milk of success,

513
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,328
But the price of fame
was looming

514
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:48,365
Asterrance and phillip:
behind the blowcontinues.

515
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,002
The 70s and 80s were a good time
for young terrance and phillip.

516
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,737
Their act on
the donny and marie show

517
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,039
Won them
a nobel peace prize.

518
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:56,207
They were on the cover
of every magazine.

519
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,943
And then in 1998,

520
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,111
Even a saturday morning
cartoon was made

521
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:01,811
Based on terrance and phillip.

522
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,449
Terrance and phillip themselves
supplied the voices.

523
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,149
Say, terrance,
what should we do

524
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,485
Aboot this strange planet
we've crashed on?

525
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,787
I don't know, phillip.

526
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,389
It seems like the alien species
here breathe an inert gas.

527
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,691
Uh-Oh, did you say
what i thought you said?

528
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,595
As leader of
the goat people,

529
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:20,498
I have seen my species nearly
wiped out by your dangerous gas.

530
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,800
Wow, that sucks.

531
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,053
The cartoon was
such a huge success

532
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:26,571
That it started to breed
confusion

533
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,271
Over whether
terrance and phillip

534
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,475
Were animated characters
or real people.

535
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,609
And so in 1998,
the comedy team started work

536
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,246
On what they thought would be
their greatest achievement,

537
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,548
A made-For-Tv movie

538
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,717
Written by and starting
terrance and phillip

539
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,850
Callednot without my anus.

540
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,586
It was their biggest project
to date,

541
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,223
But it had the misfortune
of being scheduled on a night

542
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,958
When a different and more
popular television show,

543
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,995
The john schneider variety hour
was supposed to air.

544
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,163
When fans tuned in
to see john schneider

545
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,766
And instead were treated to
the canadian made-For-Tv movie,

546
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,369
They were enraged, bewildered
and scared.

547
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,502
The fans revolted
and burned down the network,

548
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:03,008
Killing six television producers
and wounding 12 others.

549
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,610
The hatred of
terrance and phillip had begun.

550
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,362
Terrance fell into
a deep depression

551
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,045
And started abusing
wood polish.

552
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,815
Phillip beat up
an angry six-Year-Old fan

553
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,515
And was sued for
$6 million.

554
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,153
It was the first time
the duo tasted failure

555
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,888
And it nearly
killed them both.

556
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,022
What's going on here?

557
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,961
Shh, we're watchin'
behind the blow.

558
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,661
Come on, kenny,
hurry up!

559
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,131
After years of depression
and suicide attempts,

560
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,769
Terrance and phillip
finally decided to get together

561
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:32,504
For one last film,

562
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:35,939
The 1999 smash hit,
asses of fire.

563
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,576
It was one of the highest
grossing films of the summer.

564
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,444
And though
the film also started

565
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,613
The canadian-American
war of 1999

566
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,782
In which eight million people
lost their lives,

567
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,915
The film was
considered a great success.

568
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,119
After almost being executed
by the american government,

569
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,288
Terrance and phillip were
eventually returned to canada

570
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,257
Where they were touted
as heroes.

571
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,157
They had been to hell and back,

572
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,795
Through the very best and the
very worst of times together,

573
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,198
But they had seen it through,
and so ends,

574
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,566
Terrance and phillip:
behind the blow.

575
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:05,869
Terrance.

576
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,205
Oh, phillip,
you're still here too.

577
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,506
I was just
watching this video.

578
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,241
Y'know, i've never
seen it before.

579
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,375
Me neither.

580
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,447
We sure did go through
a lot together.

581
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,615
We sure did.

582
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,315
Terrance, i-

583
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,086
Don't, no, phillip,
don't say it.

584
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,821
I was an asshole,
this is mostly my fault.

585
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,122
That's what
i was gonna say,

586
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,822
You're an asshole and
this was mostly your fault.

587
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,761
But you were always the more
artistically driven of us.

588
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,930
I should've put more
into it than i did.

589
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:32,797
No, phillip.

590
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,966
I really thought
i did everything,

591
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,569
Until i tried
to do it alone.

592
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,015
Think of all
the endangered species

593
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,184
That will now vanish
because of you.

594
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,052
Karl!

595
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,088
So long, boys.

596
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,389
Wait,
dude, look.

597
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,258
Thank you, everone,
thank you.

598
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,462
You know, phillip and i have
learned an important lesson,

599
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,431
That when you go
through a lot with somebody,

600
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,366
You can't let trite things
come between you.

601
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,667
That's right, terrance.

602
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,836
You should only let trite things
come between your ass cheeks.

603
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:13,970
Oh, no!

604
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:15,089
They're back.

605
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:16,139
All right!

606
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,343
Yes, earth day
is saved, boys.

607
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,078
Everything worked out
after all.

608
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,344
It sure did.

609
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,114
Look, kenny,
everything turned out okay.

610
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,151
Say, terrance,
can you tell me who farted?

611
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,452
He sure did, phillip.

612
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,586
No, i'm asking you
his name.

613
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,789
And so terrance and phillip
got back together,

614
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,958
Proving once and for all
that fame and fortune

615
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,927
Are never as important
as friendship.

616
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,827
? Beef and lamb
chicken and ham?

617
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,163
? Step to the left
and clap your hands?

618
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,048
? Gosh we love that
chicken and ham?

619
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:40,899
? Don't they love that
chicken and ham?

620
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,538
? Beef and lamb
chicken and ham?

621
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:48,055
? Step to the left
and clap your hands?

622
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,049
? Gosh we love that
chicken and ham?

623
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:50,008
? Don't they love that
chicken and ham?

624
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,708
? Beef and lamb
chicken and ham?

625
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,610
? Step to the left
and clap your hands?

626
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,310
? Gosh we love that
chicken and ham?

627
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:54,779
? Don't they love that
chicken and ham?
