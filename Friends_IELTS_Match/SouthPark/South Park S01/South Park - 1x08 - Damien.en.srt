That was a hoot and a holler.[br]Did you like that?

00:00:09.41,00:00:11.81
- You bet![br]- That was a good episode.

00:00:11.98,00:00:15.15
But this next one, "Damien,"[br]is our favorite.

00:00:15.32,00:00:19.95
It's about good and evil[br]and being the new kid in school.

00:00:20.13,00:00:24.12
That's right, South Parketeers.[br]Being the new kid can be hard.

00:00:24.30,00:00:29.17
Matt and I know because we used to[br]beat the crap out of the new kids.

00:00:29.33,00:00:32.03
Because this episode has[br]Jesus and Satan...

00:00:32.20,00:00:35.50
...we got a lot of complaints[br]from religious groups.

00:00:35.67,00:00:39.34
They said we were "blasphemous"[br]and "sacrilegious."

00:00:39.51,00:00:44.64
Well, you're all a bunch[br]of f* * * * * g a * * * * * * s.

00:00:44.82,00:00:46.55
F* * * * * g f* * *heads.

00:00:46.72,00:00:48.91
Wow. You said a mouthful.

00:00:49.09,00:00:52.11
Hey, gang. It's our friend[br]Indian Companion.

00:00:52.29,00:00:55.92
Someone coming.

00:00:56.09,00:01:00.83
We don't care that someone's coming.[br]Can't you say something else?

00:01:01.00,00:01:05.80
It's always, "Someone coming."[br]I hope someone comes. We like people.

00:01:05.97,00:01:08.27
Let's tell Indian Companion[br]to go away.

00:01:08.44,00:01:12.34
Go away, Indian Companion!

00:01:12.51,00:01:15.71
Why don't we all sit back,[br]get a little rowdy...

00:01:15.88,00:01:19.18
...and watch "Damien."

00:01:20.32,00:01:21.62
Hooray!

00:01:53.45,00:01:55.25
Damien

00:01:57.32,00:01:59.85
Here you go, Kyle.[br]Here's yours, Stan.

00:02:00.03,00:02:03.52
- What is this?[br]- Invitations to my birthday party.

00:02:03.70,00:02:06.13
Your mom's giving you[br]a big party again?

00:02:06.30,00:02:08.23
That's right.

00:02:10.74,00:02:13.93
Kick-ass! Cartman's mom[br]throws the best parties!

00:02:14.11,00:02:17.08
- That's right.[br]- Lf my mom could cook like her...

00:02:17.24,00:02:20.14
...I'd be a big fat-ass too.[br]- That's ri... Hey!

00:02:20.31,00:02:24.01
- Eric, I didn't get an invitation.[br]- Really? Gosh...

00:02:24.18,00:02:27.71
...where could I have put Pip's[br]invitation? Let's see...

00:02:27.89,00:02:32.65
Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation...[br]I remember.

00:02:32.82,00:02:36.06
I shoved it up my ass![br]I wrote it out...

00:02:36.23,00:02:39.93
...put it in an envelope[br]and shoved it right up my ass...

00:02:40.10,00:02:44.80
...ruining any chance you had[br]of coming to my party. Sorry, old chap.

00:02:45.00,00:02:48.60
Here's yours, Wendy,[br]and here's yours, Clay.

00:02:48.77,00:02:53.54
- Children, today is a very special day.[br]- My birthday isn't until Saturday.

00:02:53.75,00:02:59.48
I'm not talking about your birthday.[br]We have a new student joining us today.

00:02:59.65,00:03:02.38
Some of you know what it's like[br]to be the new kid.

00:03:02.55,00:03:06.01
So take special care[br]to make him feel welcome.

00:03:06.19,00:03:09.25
I want you all to meet our new[br]classmate...

00:03:09.43,00:03:12.49
- What's your name again?[br]- Damien.

00:03:15.80,00:03:18.50
Say hi to Damien.

00:03:18.67,00:03:21.66
- Where are you from?[br]- The Seventh Layer of Hell.

00:03:21.84,00:03:24.33
Oh, my mother was from Alabama.

00:03:24.51,00:03:28.04
My arrival denotes[br]the beginning of the end.

00:03:28.21,00:03:30.61
- The reign of my father.[br]- Your father?

00:03:30.78,00:03:34.34
- The Prince of Darkness.[br]- We have royalty in our class.

00:03:34.52,00:03:35.68
Take your seat.

00:03:35.85,00:03:39.45
We'll finish learning about[br]singers of the baroque era.

00:03:39.62,00:03:43.06
Children, Nancy Sinatra was[br]a choice piece of ass...

00:03:43.23,00:03:46.39
New kid, want an invitation[br]to my birthday party?

00:03:46.57,00:03:49.09
Here begins pain.[br]The new domination...

00:03:49.27,00:03:52.79
Psych! I wasn't gonna[br]give you an invitation.

00:03:52.97,00:03:56.17
Hey, who cut your hair, Stevie Wonder?

00:04:00.71,00:04:02.54
- Whoa![br]- Damn, what a freak!

00:04:02.71,00:04:07.34
- I had a Poofy Pie in that desk![br]- Feel the wrath of the fallen angel.

00:04:07.52,00:04:09.82
The plague of blight is upon thee!

00:04:09.99,00:04:12.75
Do you need to sit in time-out[br]for a minute?

00:04:13.53,00:04:16.52
You got in trouble.[br]You got in trouble.

00:04:18.13,00:04:20.43
Cartman, how come my invitation...

00:04:20.60,00:04:23.97
...says "Green Mega Man"?[br]- Mine says "Red Mega Man."

00:04:24.17,00:04:27.43
- That's what you're supposed to get me.[br]- Dude!

00:04:27.61,00:04:30.97
- You don't tell people what to get you.[br]- That's weak.

00:04:31.18,00:04:32.30
It's very simple.

00:04:32.48,00:04:35.04
Green Mega Man goes with[br]Red and Yellow...

00:04:35.21,00:04:37.01
...to make Ultra[br]Mega Mega Man.

00:04:37.18,00:04:39.48
You need all three[br]or it won't work.

00:04:39.72,00:04:41.71
I'll get you what I want.

00:04:41.92,00:04:46.25
Maybe you don't want any of my mom's[br]cake, pie and ice cream, then.

00:04:46.46,00:04:47.86
Green Mega Man it is.

00:04:48.06,00:04:51.69
Now, Kenny, you are[br]to get me Yellow Mega Man.

00:04:51.86,00:04:56.82
That's because Yellow Mega Man[br]is the cheapest and your family's poor.

00:04:57.04,00:05:00.49
- What are you doing?[br]- You can't sit with us, weirdo.

00:05:00.67,00:05:03.90
Infidels! I will turn you all into[br]beasts of burden!

00:05:04.11,00:05:06.30
Go find another table, new kid.

00:05:07.18,00:05:10.11
Anyway, Kenny, Yellow Mega Man[br]is only $8.95.

00:05:10.28,00:05:13.55
So your mom can put it on layaway[br]and make payments.

00:05:16.45,00:05:17.44
Hey!

00:05:17.66,00:05:21.56
Hello. I'm Phillip.[br]They call me Pip because they hate me.

00:05:21.73,00:05:23.82
- Then I'll call you Pip.[br]- Right-o.

00:05:24.03,00:05:25.12
Hey, new kid.

00:05:26.13,00:05:31.30
Kenny says he saw your mom drop you off[br]this morning, and she's a real dog.

00:05:31.54,00:05:32.76
That does it!

00:05:37.58,00:05:38.91
What the...?

00:05:39.08,00:05:42.14
- He made Kenny a duck-billed platypus![br]- A what?

00:05:43.72,00:05:47.05
Turn him back. He has to buy[br]the Yellow Mega Man.

00:05:47.25,00:05:48.72
- Hello there.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:05:48.89,00:05:50.15
- How's it going?[br]- Bad.

00:05:50.32,00:05:54.52
- Why bad?[br]- The new kid's a total weirdo freak.

00:05:54.69,00:05:57.79
Children, you shouldn't not like[br]somebody...

00:05:57.96,00:06:02.23
...just because they're different.[br]Let me sing you a little song.

00:06:32.90,00:06:35.46
- What were we talking about?[br]- The new kid.

00:06:35.67,00:06:40.47
Death to the holy. The wrath of the[br]fallen angels now waits for you all!

00:06:40.67,00:06:44.51
- Whoa![br]- That is one fudged-up little cracker.

00:06:44.68,00:06:45.73
We told you.

00:06:48.31,00:06:50.47
We've got to do something, children!

00:06:50.65,00:06:53.52
He's tearing my cafeteria apart.

00:06:53.72,00:06:54.74
Bring me Jesus!

00:06:54.92,00:06:58.19
My wrath shall continue[br]until I speak with Jesus!

00:06:58.89,00:07:00.15
- Jesus?[br]- Jesus?

00:07:01.33,00:07:04.30
- Two minutes to air, Jesus.[br]- Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou.

00:07:04.50,00:07:07.56
- Jesus![br]- I only do autographs after the show.

00:07:07.77,00:07:11.10
There's a big problem.[br]Some new kid showed up...

00:07:11.27,00:07:14.57
...and Chef thinks he's evil.[br]- Look what he did to Kenny.

00:07:15.87,00:07:17.50
Wow. That's pretty heavy.

00:07:17.71,00:07:19.73
He keeps throwing things around...

00:07:19.91,00:07:23.04
...saying stuff about his[br]"Dark Prince father."

00:07:23.25,00:07:25.24
- The Dark Prince?[br]- Yeah.

00:07:25.45,00:07:29.32
So it was written. The cycle of years[br]brings the Son of Evil.

00:07:29.52,00:07:31.35
He's talking like the new kid.

00:07:31.56,00:07:33.58
Thou must taketh me[br]to Satan's seed...

00:07:33.76,00:07:36.45
...so mine eyes can confirm[br]the wretched truth.

00:07:37.86,00:07:38.95
Okay.

00:07:40.23,00:07:44.86
Five minutes until recess is over,[br]you little bastards.

00:07:45.07,00:07:49.13
Now, as you can see,[br]Red Mega Man uses the Mega-Cycle.

00:07:49.31,00:07:51.87
Which is what Clyde will be getting me.

00:07:52.04,00:07:56.50
Wendy, you were supposed to get me[br]the Mega Power Chopper.

00:07:56.68,00:07:59.24
But I'm changing that to[br]Yellow Mega Man...

00:07:59.42,00:08:03.01
...since Kenny was turned into[br]a duck-billed platypus.

00:08:03.22,00:08:06.52
That means that the Mega Man[br]Beach House...

00:08:06.69,00:08:09.85
...will be given by two people...

00:08:11.46,00:08:12.59
Our slide!

00:08:12.80,00:08:14.49
Feel my wrath!

00:08:15.73,00:08:20.80
You shouldn't be so upset. I know it's[br]hard, but they'll accept you someday.

00:08:21.01,00:08:23.44
I don't need it.[br]I'm the son of Satan.

00:08:23.64,00:08:26.11
I know what it's like[br]not to have friends.

00:08:26.28,00:08:29.37
You should speak to the counselor.[br]He helps me.

00:08:29.58,00:08:33.92
- Damien![br]- Son of stench. Ruler of the weak.

00:08:34.12,00:08:36.59
So it is thou.[br]Son of Lucifer!

00:08:36.79,00:08:40.19
Your time here is short.[br]Soon, my father comes.

00:08:40.39,00:08:42.62
Let him come.[br]I shall stop him.

00:08:42.83,00:08:45.23
Behold, he is already upon us.

00:08:46.83,00:08:47.89
Oh, dude!

00:08:56.21,00:08:57.97
What the hell's going on?

00:08:58.18,00:09:00.80
It's that guy from[br]the public access show.

00:09:01.01,00:09:04.04
- What's happening?[br]- Come over here if you're scared.

00:09:04.22,00:09:06.68
I'll protect you. Not you, damn it!

00:09:10.16,00:09:14.15
Jesus, my father says he chooses you.[br]He calls you out.

00:09:14.43,00:09:17.95
Be here at this time tomorrow[br]to discuss the terms.

00:09:18.16,00:09:21.62
Let the final battle between[br]good and evil be fought...

00:09:21.80,00:09:23.43
...right here in South Park!

00:09:23.64,00:09:26.07
Come on, Ned.[br]Let's get to the bookie!

00:09:26.27,00:09:30.30
- You're gonna fight Satan?[br]- It has been ordained from the start.

00:09:30.48,00:09:35.07
My children, this is the most crucial[br]and serious time of all history.

00:09:36.71,00:09:39.74
Who will win?[br]Jesus or the Prince of Darkness?

00:09:39.92,00:09:43.72
The final battle between good and[br]evil, only on pay-per-view.

00:09:43.89,00:09:47.09
Jesus vs. Satan, live from[br]South Park on Saturday!

00:09:47.26,00:09:49.23
Only $49.95.

00:09:49.96,00:09:54.86
Wait a minute. Saturday's my party![br]They can't have the fight on Saturday!

00:09:55.07,00:09:58.00
Do we go to the fight[br]or Cartman's birthday?

00:09:58.17,00:09:59.19
Birthday!

00:09:59.40,00:10:01.90
We can't miss the[br]apocalyptic battle.

00:10:02.11,00:10:04.67
Guys, my mom's getting[br]a Ferris wheel.

00:10:04.88,00:10:07.28
We have to at least[br]see the weigh-in.

00:10:07.45,00:10:12.35
Who decided it had to be on Saturday?[br]This is a plot against me, isn't it?

00:10:15.29,00:10:18.65
- When is Satan gonna show up?[br]- Did he show up yet?

00:10:18.86,00:10:21.12
- Not yet.[br]- Hey, Jesus, if you win...

00:10:21.29,00:10:23.69
...can you turn Kenny back to normal?

00:10:23.90,00:10:25.95
What the hell do you mean, "if"?

00:10:26.16,00:10:28.22
- Don't mind him. He's Jewish.[br]- Oh.

00:10:28.40,00:10:32.50
We're all with you, Jesus.[br]We put all our money on you.

00:10:33.71,00:10:35.54
Thank you for your faith...

00:10:35.71,00:10:38.30
...but I don't think you understand.

00:10:38.51,00:10:41.00
You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus.

00:10:44.75,00:10:47.15
Behold, the Evil One approaches.

00:10:50.79,00:10:53.55
Holy poop on a stick!

00:10:53.76,00:10:55.78
Puny son of Jehovah.

00:10:55.96,00:10:59.59
Prepare to enter thy house of pain.

00:11:01.03,00:11:03.76
Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge!

00:11:03.97,00:11:06.96
Now, that is a man who's eaten[br]a lot of beef.

00:11:07.17,00:11:12.41
Son of God, I will smash thy face[br]into small little bits.

00:11:12.61,00:11:14.48
- Oh. Oh, yeah?[br]- Damn!

00:11:14.65,00:11:18.74
I have such delightful horrors to[br]unleash upon thee.

00:11:19.62,00:11:20.68
Oh, yeah?

00:11:23.25,00:11:28.62
Satan weighs in at[br]320 pounds, 4 ounces.

00:11:31.56,00:11:36.83
Jesus Christ weighs in at[br]1 35 pounds, 1 ounce.

00:11:37.97,00:11:39.13
Oh, crap.

00:11:39.34,00:11:41.00
I weigh more than that!

00:11:41.21,00:11:44.57
Let the new prince be decided[br]on Saturday.

00:11:44.78,00:11:48.01
First South Park, then the world.

00:11:50.52,00:11:53.64
Well, I think I'II...

00:11:53.85,00:11:58.55
- I think I left the oven on.[br]- I think I left your oven on too.

00:12:00.56,00:12:03.29
See you Saturday, Jesus. Good luck.

00:12:05.56,00:12:07.33
- Change my bet![br]- Mine on the Devil!

00:12:07.53,00:12:10.26
- I want to change my bet to Satan.[br]- Me too.

00:12:10.44,00:12:11.56
I was here first.

00:12:12.90,00:12:14.17
As your counselor...

00:12:14.37,00:12:18.24
...I want you to feel like[br]you can tell me anything, okay?

00:12:18.41,00:12:22.04
Being new can be tough.[br]But I'm your friend, m'kay?

00:12:22.25,00:12:26.41
- Everybody hates me.[br]- Well, why do you suppose that is?

00:12:26.82,00:12:30.98
- Because I'm the son of the Devil?[br]- That's good, why else?

00:12:31.36,00:12:33.62
Because I burn them and kill them?

00:12:33.83,00:12:35.62
Well, maybe that's it.

00:12:35.79,00:12:39.96
What you need to do, Damien,[br]is to be overly nice.

00:12:40.16,00:12:44.79
No matter how mean the other kids are,[br]just don't retaliate.

00:12:44.97,00:12:46.66
Be passive, okay?

00:12:46.87,00:12:51.81
That's what I taught Pip. Just look[br]how much the other kids like him now.

00:12:52.01,00:12:57.38
- I bet I can spit the most on him.[br]- Oh, yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.

00:12:57.58,00:13:00.07
A little higher and you've got it.

00:13:00.25,00:13:02.98
Recess sucks without any slides[br]or nothing.

00:13:03.15,00:13:05.55
Here comes the unholy butthole now.

00:13:06.06,00:13:09.25
Thanks for burning everything,[br]you little bitch.

00:13:09.43,00:13:13.73
I apologize for that and turning[br]your friend into a platypus.

00:13:13.90,00:13:17.56
I was doing my father's bidding.[br]I didn't have a choice.

00:13:18.70,00:13:20.30
Oh, excuse me, new kid.

00:13:20.47,00:13:23.93
I didn't mean to fart on you.[br]I didn't have a choice.

00:13:24.38,00:13:26.43
You smell like a fart, new kid.

00:13:26.61,00:13:30.55
- We're gonna call you "Fartboy" now.[br]- Bye-bye, Fartboy.

00:13:30.75,00:13:34.34
- How are you, Damien?[br]- They farted on me and called me...

00:13:34.52,00:13:37.45
Fartboy? Perhaps they[br]won't call me that anymore.

00:13:43.93,00:13:47.56
Excuse me.[br]I just talked to the bookie.

00:13:49.57,00:13:50.97
I have been forsaken!

00:13:51.17,00:13:54.66
It seems that several bets[br]were changed to Satan.

00:13:54.87,00:13:59.50
In fact, it seems that only one person[br]is still betting on me.

00:13:59.71,00:14:02.27
You should all be ashamed of[br]yourselves.

00:14:02.45,00:14:05.91
Betting against your lord and savior.[br]I am disgusted!

00:14:06.12,00:14:09.11
You changed your bet.[br]You forsaked me too.

00:14:09.32,00:14:13.28
Oh, right, well. He has a few[br]hundred pounds on you, Jesus.

00:14:13.49,00:14:17.79
I implore you. Don't bet[br]on the Dark One. You will never win.

00:14:18.00,00:14:22.13
I'm sorry I have sinned against you.[br]I'm gonna go to the bookie...

00:14:22.30,00:14:26.03
...and change my bet right now.[br]- Yeah, me too.

00:14:26.20,00:14:27.97
Praise the lord!

00:14:28.14,00:14:31.73
Thank you, sweet Jesus,[br]for showing us the light!

00:14:31.91,00:14:32.90
See you later.

00:14:35.38,00:14:37.37
Does he think we're crazy?

00:14:42.65,00:14:44.64
You're all a bunch of Judases.

00:14:45.49,00:14:47.69
- Hey, Jesus.[br]- Why are you out so late?

00:14:47.89,00:14:50.19
We have to find Mega Mans[br]for Cartman.

00:14:50.40,00:14:54.26
Oh. Kids, you believe[br]I can beat Satan, right?

00:14:54.43,00:14:57.89
- Sure. You're the son of God.[br]- Are you having doubts?

00:14:58.10,00:15:02.16
No, no. But could you[br]help me train a little?

00:15:03.41,00:15:06.54
Satan, what will the outcome[br]of the fight be?

00:15:06.74,00:15:09.74
I will crush him like a little bug.

00:15:09.95,00:15:13.28
Satan, what about your[br]involvement in the Gulf War?

00:15:15.45,00:15:19.62
Let's focus on the fight. I'm sick[br]of these rumors about my fighters.

00:15:19.79,00:15:23.96
"He's a dirty fighter." "He causes[br]all the world's violence and death."

00:15:24.16,00:15:28.16
It's just getting old.[br]Let everything be decided in the ring.

00:15:28.37,00:15:31.36
Shouldn't you be out shopping[br]for my presents?

00:15:31.57,00:15:34.13
- Drink these raw eggs, Jesus.[br]- No way.

00:15:34.34,00:15:39.87
I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother[br]would never speak to me again.

00:15:40.04,00:15:42.84
- You're his sparring partner.[br]- You have to.

00:15:43.01,00:15:46.01
Satan must be defeated.[br]Please help me train.

00:15:46.22,00:15:49.65
Okay. But I'm just[br]gonna tap you, all right?

00:15:49.85,00:15:52.91
- Give it your best shot...[br]- Oh, God in heaven!

00:15:53.09,00:15:56.96
- What have I done?[br]- Anybody get the number of that truck?

00:16:01.83,00:16:04.50
Come on, kiddies. Eat more.

00:16:05.54,00:16:08.94
Welcome, Clyde.[br]Presents on the table to your left.

00:16:09.11,00:16:11.51
Welcome, Bebe.[br]Presents go to your left.

00:16:11.71,00:16:14.37
- Welcome, Chef.[br]- Yup. Here's your present.

00:16:14.55,00:16:17.01
Well, nice party, see you later.

00:16:17.22,00:16:20.71
- You just got here, Chef.[br]- But the fight is starting.

00:16:20.92,00:16:24.88
Dude, check it out.[br]Cartman's mom made chili.

00:16:25.09,00:16:27.39
That's my favorite kind of chili.

00:16:28.46,00:16:32.59
- I guess all the kids are at that party.[br]- It's always a huge event.

00:16:32.76,00:16:36.49
Sometimes I sneak up to the fence[br]and pretend I'm there.

00:16:36.70,00:16:39.14
The other kids have always hated you?

00:16:39.30,00:16:41.57
They make fun of the fat boy too.

00:16:41.74,00:16:44.94
Now I think they like him because[br]he picks on me.

00:16:47.01,00:16:49.61
In the blue corner,[br]wearing white trunks...

00:16:49.81,00:16:52.81
...weighing in at a mere 1 40 pounds...

00:16:52.98,00:16:58.89
...Jesús "El Savior" Christ.

00:17:00.63,00:17:02.92
And in the very, very black corner...

00:17:03.09,00:17:05.29
...wearing very, very black trunks...

00:17:05.46,00:17:08.09
...the king of all that is evil...

00:17:08.27,00:17:12.13
...Beelzebub!

00:17:16.64,00:17:18.34
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:17:18.51,00:17:22.17
...let's get ready to rumble!

00:17:24.02,00:17:28.58
I want a clean fight. No punches below[br]the belt, holding or miracles.

00:17:33.16,00:17:36.92
- What are you doing here?[br]- You weren't invited, new kid.

00:17:37.13,00:17:40.50
- Neither were you, Pip.[br]- I tried to tell Damien, but...

00:17:40.67,00:17:44.73
Wait a minute. I want to do[br]something special for your party.

00:17:56.05,00:17:58.31
- Wow.[br]- Whoa, that was cool!

00:17:59.48,00:18:03.78
- You're not such a bad guy, Damien.[br]- Come on in and join the party.

00:18:16.20,00:18:19.14
Come on, you little wuss, fight!

00:18:19.30,00:18:20.93
Throw a punch.

00:18:21.74,00:18:25.18
I wonder what Stan got me[br]for my birthday.

00:18:25.34,00:18:30.58
Look, a Blue Mega Man! Thank you, Stan.[br]You may eat pie, cake and ice cream.

00:18:31.75,00:18:35.81
And what did Wendy get me?[br]Oh, it's the Yellow Mega Man!

00:18:36.02,00:18:38.32
Have some pie, cake[br]and ice cream.

00:18:38.56,00:18:41.82
Oh, look what Kyle got me.[br]It's a Red...

00:18:42.03,00:18:44.05
Ants in the Pants?[br]Ants in the...?

00:18:44.23,00:18:45.56
Ants in the Pants?!

00:18:45.76,00:18:49.26
- It's a game, dude. It's fun![br]- You son of a bitch!

00:18:49.47,00:18:53.73
I told you Red Mega Man![br]Now I can't make Ultra Mega Mega Man.

00:18:53.94,00:18:56.41
- You piece of crap![br]- They were all out!

00:18:56.57,00:18:59.20
I hate you! I want you to die!

00:18:59.38,00:19:00.74
Die!

00:19:00.95,00:19:02.61
That's it! Party is over!

00:19:02.81,00:19:04.08
Everybody go home!

00:19:09.22,00:19:13.12
Get the hell out, I said![br]Party's over, get out, goddamn it!

00:19:13.29,00:19:16.62
- You need to mellow out.[br]- Take your game with you!

00:19:17.46,00:19:21.12
- That kid has real emotional problems.[br]- He does this all the time.

00:19:21.33,00:19:24.63
Come on. We can still catch[br]the end of the fight.

00:19:26.87,00:19:28.86
What a splendid party.

00:19:33.11,00:19:34.74
Fight, damn it.

00:19:40.48,00:19:44.98
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked.[br]You've got to fight, Jesus.

00:19:45.19,00:19:46.66
Why? What's the point?

00:19:46.82,00:19:49.76
No one believes in me.[br]Everyone bet on Satan.

00:19:49.93,00:19:53.92
My father and the town forsaked me.[br]I'm completely forsook.

00:19:54.13,00:19:57.62
Someone bet on you.[br]One person still has money on you.

00:19:57.84,00:20:00.86
It doesn't matter. He's too strong.[br]I give up.

00:20:01.07,00:20:02.63
Snap out of it, Jesus!

00:20:02.84,00:20:05.74
What would Nancy Kerrigan do?[br]Not give up.

00:20:05.94,00:20:08.88
When it looked the darkest,[br]she fought to be the best.

00:20:09.08,00:20:11.81
- She wouldn't stop until she won.[br]- Stan?

00:20:12.02,00:20:14.11
- She wouldn't take second.[br]- Stan.

00:20:14.32,00:20:16.31
- She wanted the gold.[br]- Stan!

00:20:16.52,00:20:18.28
- What?![br]- She got silver, dude.

00:20:18.46,00:20:19.51
She was second.

00:20:21.63,00:20:23.18
- Really?[br]- Yeah, dude.

00:20:23.39,00:20:26.83
Never mind, Jesus.[br]Nancy Kerrigan sucks.

00:20:27.03,00:20:31.97
Somebody once said, "Don't try to be[br]a great man, just be a man."

00:20:32.14,00:20:33.26
Who said that?

00:20:33.47,00:20:34.67
You did, Jesus.

00:20:37.88,00:20:40.64
You're right, Stan.[br]Thank you, boys.

00:20:43.58,00:20:46.88
- Was that in the Bible?[br]- I saw it on Star Trek.

00:20:48.82,00:20:51.62
Come on, sissy. Hit me. Hit me!

00:20:51.82,00:20:54.45
Okay, pal. You asked for it.

00:21:00.56,00:21:03.50
Oh, you got me.

00:21:03.70,00:21:05.64
One, two, three...

00:21:05.84,00:21:11.37
- No way, he barely touched him.[br]...seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:21:11.54,00:21:12.53
You're out!

00:21:14.68,00:21:15.94
Our savior!

00:21:16.15,00:21:17.24
Winner by knockout...

00:21:17.41,00:21:21.91
...and still undisputed ruler[br]of your spiritual kingdom...

00:21:22.09,00:21:28.25
...Jesús "El Savior" Christ.

00:21:29.36,00:21:33.46
- Hey, he isn't hurt. He threw the fight![br]- Yeah!

00:21:33.66,00:21:36.22
Fools. You are all fools.

00:21:36.43,00:21:38.96
Of course I took a dive.[br]Don't you see?

00:21:39.14,00:21:43.33
Who do you think was the one person[br]that bet on Jesus to win?

00:21:45.21,00:21:46.87
Me, you idiots.

00:21:47.04,00:21:53.31
Now I'll take your money, return to Hell[br]much richer and buy some real estate.

00:21:55.59,00:21:58.75
- I don't believe this![br]- What a mean thing to do.

00:21:58.96,00:22:00.65
Farewell, fools.

00:22:00.86,00:22:03.38
That guy is a jerk.

00:22:04.50,00:22:08.40
- Jesus told you not to bet on Satan.[br]- Boy, did we get screwed.

00:22:08.60,00:22:12.59
Jesus, we're sorry.[br]Can you ever forgive us?

00:22:13.57,00:22:16.30
Aw, heck. Do I have a choice?

00:22:18.11,00:22:20.98
Well, Jesus, I definitely[br]learned my lesson.

00:22:21.15,00:22:24.64
Never bet on evil, because[br]when you do... Ned, look!

00:22:24.85,00:22:28.38
A rare duck-billed platypus![br]It's coming right for us!

00:22:31.02,00:22:34.48
- Oh, my God. They killed Kenny![br]- You bastard!

00:22:34.69,00:22:37.46
Goodbye, guys.[br]It was nice meeting you.

00:22:37.66,00:22:39.60
- You're leaving?[br]- I have to.

00:22:39.76,00:22:41.73
My dad's always on the move.

00:22:41.93,00:22:46.93
- Wow, I feel kind of bad for that kid.[br]- Just when he fit in he has to leave.

00:22:47.10,00:22:51.51
Parents are so cruel. Don't they know[br]a child needs security most of all?

00:22:52.28,00:22:56.34
More pie, hon?

00:22:56.45,00:23:00.88
No more pie.
