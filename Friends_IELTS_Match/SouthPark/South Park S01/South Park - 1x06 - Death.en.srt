"Get your bitch-ass back in the kitchen[br]and make me some pie."

00:00:10.25,00:00:12.98
That was a hoot and a holler.

00:00:13.19,00:00:17.62
This next episode is definitely[br]our favorite. It's called "Death."

00:00:17.82,00:00:19.88
Stan's grandpa wants to die...

00:00:20.09,00:00:23.82
...and all the parents[br]are protesting a TV show.

00:00:24.03,00:00:29.06
Let's get right to the point,[br]should old people be allowed to die?

00:00:29.40,00:00:34.00
We're both firm believers[br]in euthanasia. At a certain age...

00:00:34.21,00:00:36.47
...things get too boring and painful.

00:00:36.68,00:00:40.51
You should be able to, you know,[br]by people you love.

00:00:40.71,00:00:44.24
I've asked my family[br]to put a bullet in me when I'm 30.

00:00:44.45,00:00:48.28
Who are Terrance and Phillip,[br]and why are they different?

00:00:48.49,00:00:51.46
Terrance and Phillip is a show[br]the boys watch.

00:00:51.66,00:00:56.09
The truth is, they're Canadian.[br]That's why they're so silly.

00:00:56.30,00:00:59.06
How many lives does Kenny have left?

00:00:59.26,00:01:02.70
Will they eventually run out,[br]like a video game?

00:01:02.90,00:01:06.10
There's something people have[br]to understand.

00:01:06.31,00:01:09.76
We created Kenny.[br]If we wanna kill him, we can.

00:01:09.98,00:01:13.14
That's our right.[br]Leave us alone.

00:01:13.35,00:01:16.94
So are you guys as anti-Semitic[br]as some might believe?

00:01:17.12,00:01:20.14
People have accused us[br]of anti-Semitism...

00:01:20.35,00:01:22.51
...but I'm Jewish and proud.

00:01:22.72,00:01:26.28
I can say with certainty[br]that I am not anti-Semitic.

00:01:26.49,00:01:28.25
I am, however.

00:01:28.99,00:01:33.83
So now, sit back, relax[br]and enjoy "Death."

00:02:07.73,00:02:09.56
Death

00:02:22.18,00:02:26.24
Now blow out the candles, Grandpa.

00:02:28.72,00:02:31.62
- How's it feel to be 1 02, Paps?[br]- Shoot me.

00:02:31.82,00:02:35.92
- Make a wish, Grandpa.[br]- I wish I were dead.

00:02:36.13,00:02:39.29
- That's silly.[br]- I'm not being silly, kill me.

00:02:39.50,00:02:44.20
- I'd do it myself, but I'm too old.[br]- Who wants ice cream with their cake?

00:02:44.37,00:02:47.46
- I will.[br]- It's 8:00. My favorite TV show is on.

00:02:47.64,00:02:51.08
That show's for babies.[br]It's so stupid.

00:02:51.28,00:02:53.71
Can I eat in the living room, Mom?

00:02:53.88,00:02:56.91
All right, but take your grampy[br]with you.

00:02:57.12,00:02:59.17
- Damn it![br]- Language!

00:02:59.55,00:03:01.54
Back to Terrance and Phillip.

00:03:01.75,00:03:07.19
- Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.[br]- Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.

00:03:13.07,00:03:14.73
Damn it!

00:03:14.93,00:03:19.13
- Want to make a dollar, Billy?[br]- My name's not Billy, it's Stan.

00:03:19.47,00:03:22.41
- Damn it, do you want a dollar or not?[br]- Sure.

00:03:22.61,00:03:26.87
- You just have to do one thing for me.[br]- I'm not gonna kill you.

00:03:27.08,00:03:29.07
- Why not?[br]- I'll get in trouble.

00:03:29.28,00:03:34.48
- I killed my grandpa when I was young.[br]- Leave me alone, Grandpa.

00:03:34.82,00:03:36.75
What has our youth come to?

00:03:36.92,00:03:39.41
Kids won't even[br]kill their grandparents.

00:03:41.39,00:03:46.63
Hey, Terrance, now that you farted[br]I think I might fart too.

00:03:47.33,00:03:49.39
You farted.

00:03:50.30,00:03:52.27
Kyle, what are you watching?

00:03:52.47,00:03:55.84
- Phillip, would you like a flower?[br]- I sure would.

00:03:56.04,00:03:59.17
All right then, here's a tulip.

00:03:59.64,00:04:03.24
- What is this? It's horrible.[br]- It's Terrance and Phillip.

00:04:03.45,00:04:06.25
- Take that, you stupid dick.[br]- What did he say?

00:04:06.45,00:04:09.35
- You're an asshole, Phillip.[br]- What?!

00:04:10.52,00:04:13.58
You are not to watch[br]that show anymore.

00:04:13.79,00:04:17.49
- It's immature toilet humor.[br]- But everybody watches it.

00:04:17.70,00:04:20.60
Really, is that so?

00:04:20.80,00:04:26.00
- Looks like you're about to fart.[br]- You're exactly right, Terrance.

00:04:28.47,00:04:30.46
- Sweet.[br]- Eric, dear...

00:04:30.68,00:04:34.24
...I just got a call[br]from your friend Kyle's mother.

00:04:34.45,00:04:39.28
She said that this show is naughty[br]and might make you a potty-mouth.

00:04:39.48,00:04:42.51
That's crap.[br]Kyle's mom is a f* * *ing Jew.

00:04:42.72,00:04:44.38
Okay, hon.

00:04:50.80,00:04:54.10
- I'm not going to kill you, Grandpa.[br]- Ingrate!

00:04:54.30,00:04:57.56
- Good night, Grandpa.[br]- You son of a whore!

00:05:01.31,00:05:02.57
What was that for?

00:05:02.74,00:05:06.11
Your stupid mother made me[br]miss Terrance and Phillip.

00:05:06.31,00:05:09.80
What's the idea of having your mom[br]call all our moms?

00:05:10.02,00:05:13.75
- She did it on her own.[br]- Why does this happen every month?

00:05:13.95,00:05:18.95
It seems like every month,[br]Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass...

00:05:19.16,00:05:22.06
...and I always get screwed by it.[br]- Children...

00:05:22.26,00:05:27.53
- A certain student's mother called.[br]- I wonder who that could have been?

00:05:27.73,00:05:33.50
She informed me that some of you might[br]be watching Terrance and Phillip.

00:05:33.71,00:05:37.47
That show is bad, Mr. Garrison.[br]That's right, Mr. Hat.

00:05:37.68,00:05:40.80
Shows like that are called[br]"toilet humor."

00:05:41.01,00:05:44.28
They don't expand your minds.

00:05:44.58,00:05:48.49
Children, these kinds of shows[br]are senseless, vile trash.

00:05:48.69,00:05:51.38
Kenny, why are you late to class?

00:05:54.69,00:05:56.75
Okay, Kenny, be seated.

00:05:56.96,00:06:00.86
The reason the parents of South Park[br]are upset is because...

00:06:01.07,00:06:03.09
Yes, Kenny, what is it?

00:06:03.54,00:06:06.33
You just came from the bathroom.

00:06:06.54,00:06:09.03
Okay, okay, go ahead.

00:06:09.24,00:06:13.20
You enjoy the show even though[br]it isn't based in reality.

00:06:13.61,00:06:16.88
There's more to life[br]than two men farting.

00:06:17.08,00:06:21.35
Throughout history,[br]there have always been very bad shows.

00:06:21.55,00:06:23.52
Usually they get canceled.

00:06:23.76,00:06:29.39
You should be enlightening your mind[br]with more intelligent entertainment.

00:06:29.66,00:06:33.53
- Smells like you slaughtered a cow.[br]- Pay attention!

00:06:33.73,00:06:38.64
I'm requesting that you don't watch[br]Terrance and Phillip anymore.

00:06:38.84,00:06:41.53
- What?[br]- Not watch Terrance and Phillip?

00:06:41.87,00:06:45.27
That's right. Are there any questions?[br]Yes, Stanley?

00:06:45.48,00:06:48.84
Is it okay to kill somebody[br]if they want you to?

00:06:49.31,00:06:52.48
- What?[br]- My grandpa is asking me to kill him.

00:06:52.68,00:06:56.98
- Sometimes I wonder if I should.[br]- Then you should.

00:06:57.19,00:07:00.16
- Really?[br]- Yeah. A guy named Jack Laborkian...

00:07:00.36,00:07:04.06
...goes around and murders people[br]that ask him to.

00:07:04.33,00:07:07.70
Maybe we could get him[br]to kill Kyle's mom.

00:07:07.90,00:07:10.73
Is it okay to assist somebody[br]with suicide?

00:07:11.04,00:07:15.60
Stan, I'm not touching that one[br]with a 20-foot pole.

00:07:23.68,00:07:29.68
We're gonna miss Terrance and Phillip.[br]I think I'm already having withdrawal.

00:07:31.06,00:07:34.36
Don't worry, dude,[br]we can watch it at my house.

00:07:34.56,00:07:36.46
Won't your grandpa be there?

00:07:36.66,00:07:39.43
Just kill him.[br]Maybe he'll give you money.

00:07:39.63,00:07:41.19
- Hello there.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:07:41.40,00:07:42.70
- How's it going?[br]- Bad.

00:07:42.90,00:07:45.70
- Why bad?[br]- Is it okay to kill your grandpa?

00:07:45.90,00:07:49.34
You can't kill my grandpa,[br]he's already passed on.

00:07:49.54,00:07:53.48
- No, I mean kill my grandpa.[br]- I don't think that's okay.

00:07:53.68,00:07:56.41
- I think that's illegal.[br]- See, I told you.

00:07:56.61,00:08:00.78
What if he really wants to die,[br]and he's just asking for help?

00:08:00.99,00:08:04.65
Yeah, like assisted suicide.[br]What about that?

00:08:05.69,00:08:08.96
I don't wanna touch that[br]with a 40-foot pole.

00:08:09.53,00:08:12.29
Why won't anybody talk about this?

00:08:12.50,00:08:15.96
I was not aware of this horrible show[br]until recently.

00:08:16.13,00:08:18.93
I have a clip to demonstrate[br]what I mean.

00:08:19.14,00:08:21.11
- Phillip, guess what?[br]- What?

00:08:21.31,00:08:23.50
Fart.

00:08:24.18,00:08:27.74
Now apparently, that's supposed[br]to be funny.

00:08:27.95,00:08:30.78
He farted right on his head.

00:08:31.58,00:08:35.31
Not allowing our kids to watch[br]this show is not enough.

00:08:35.52,00:08:41.52
We need to boycott the entire network.[br]All those in favor?

00:08:45.83,00:08:49.20
I think I've caught a touch[br]of the flu from Kenny.

00:08:49.40,00:08:54.00
- I've got the green-apple splatters.[br]- Green-apple splatters.

00:08:57.98,00:09:00.64
Hi, Grandpa,[br]I brought my friends over.

00:09:00.85,00:09:04.11
Billy, help me stick this fork[br]in the outlet.

00:09:04.32,00:09:07.25
- No, Grandpa.[br]- Kill me, goddamn it.

00:09:07.45,00:09:10.85
- I can't even kill a deer.[br]- Have your friends do it.

00:09:11.06,00:09:13.85
- You kill me.[br]- I would never kill somebody...

00:09:14.06,00:09:16.86
...unless they pissed me off.[br]- Is that a fact?

00:09:17.06,00:09:19.36
Let me tell you something, porky...

00:09:19.56,00:09:23.90
...your mom was over here earlier,[br]and I humped her like a bitch.

00:09:24.10,00:09:25.23
That's right.

00:09:25.44,00:09:30.14
And I dug up your great grandma's[br]skeleton and had my way with her.

00:09:30.34,00:09:33.94
- Choice piece of ass.[br]- Piece of crap, I'll kill you!

00:09:34.15,00:09:36.91
- That's the spirit, tubby.[br]- Come on.

00:09:37.12,00:09:40.71
- Don't talk about my mom like that![br]- Let's watch TV.

00:09:40.92,00:09:44.12
I ever tell you how[br]I boofed your dad, fatso?

00:09:44.32,00:09:48.45
- I can't believe that son of a bitch![br]- Have some Snacky Cakes.

00:09:48.66,00:09:51.13
- Dude, Snacky Cakes?[br]- What do I do?

00:09:51.33,00:09:53.92
- He really wants to die.[br]- It's okay.

00:09:54.13,00:09:56.40
- Ask the Lord for guidance.[br]- Yeah.

00:09:56.60,00:09:59.63
And now back to Jesus and Pals.

00:09:59.84,00:10:04.64
Yea, believe in me and ye[br]shall find peace. First caller?

00:10:04.84,00:10:09.78
- Is this Jesus?[br]- Yes. You need to turn your TV down.

00:10:09.98,00:10:13.14
- Sorry. This is Martin...[br]- From Aspen Park.

00:10:13.35,00:10:18.58
- How did you know that?[br]- Because I'm the son of God, brainiac.

00:10:18.79,00:10:22.16
- I have a cousin who cheated[br]on the SATs...

00:10:22.36,00:10:26.59
Tell little Gregory that cheating[br]is lying, and lying is wrong.

00:10:26.80,00:10:29.82
Okay. Thanks for the advice, Jesus.

00:10:30.03,00:10:32.09
- Next caller.[br]- Jesus?

00:10:32.30,00:10:35.90
- Yes, my son.[br]- Is it okay to kill somebody...

00:10:36.11,00:10:40.37
...if they ask you to,[br]like assisted suicide. Is that okay?

00:10:40.58,00:10:42.10
- My son...[br]- Yes?

00:10:42.31,00:10:45.15
...I'm not touching that[br]with a 60-foot pole.

00:10:45.35,00:10:46.82
- Goddamn![br]- I heard that.

00:10:47.02,00:10:51.28
- What's wrong with everybody?[br]- Hey, Terrance and Phillip is on.

00:10:51.49,00:10:54.65
- Think we'll get in trouble?[br]- Don't be a butthole.

00:10:54.89,00:10:58.09
Your mom's a bitch,[br]but we shouldn't suffer.

00:10:58.26,00:11:00.86
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!

00:11:01.03,00:11:05.53
Bitch.[br]Your mom is a bitch.

00:11:05.70,00:11:07.60
Back to Terrance and Phillip.

00:11:07.81,00:11:12.00
- Phillip, would you like some beans?[br]- Yeah, I love beans.

00:11:12.21,00:11:17.77
- I bet I know what's coming.[br]- Billy, would you hold this for me.

00:11:17.98,00:11:20.95
Okay, Grandpa, just get out[br]of the way.

00:11:21.15,00:11:25.15
- Those beans might make me fart.[br]- Well, don't fart on me.

00:11:25.52,00:11:28.46
Dude, he's gonna fart[br]on his head again.

00:11:28.86,00:11:31.52
Hey, you're gonna miss it, Kenny.

00:11:31.73,00:11:34.99
- You're such an asshole, Terrance.[br]- I sure am.

00:11:39.67,00:11:44.11
- Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.[br]- What the hell are you doing?

00:11:44.31,00:11:47.77
We're not watching[br]Terrance and Phillip, I swear.

00:11:47.98,00:11:51.81
No, I mean what the hell[br]are you doing to Grandpa?

00:11:53.79,00:11:56.95
Tug a little harder, Billy.

00:11:59.09,00:12:02.03
You jerk![br]You were trying to kill Grandpa.

00:12:02.23,00:12:05.63
- I'm telling Mom.[br]- Damn it, I was so close.

00:12:05.83,00:12:08.26
Four boys from South Park, Colorado...

00:12:08.47,00:12:12.06
...tried to viciously murder[br]an innocent grandfather.

00:12:12.27,00:12:17.30
Boys, what drove you to the edge[br]and changed you into demonic bastards?

00:12:17.51,00:12:20.60
We were watching[br]Terrance and Phillip and...

00:12:20.81,00:12:24.51
Terrance and Phillip?[br]So that show is to blame.

00:12:24.72,00:12:29.81
These boys' minds have been tainted[br]by the garbage on television...

00:12:30.02,00:12:32.65
...and we are fed up.

00:12:32.86,00:12:34.59
Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:12:34.79,00:12:37.99
We have to stop this smut from airing.

00:12:38.20,00:12:43.13
We will march to the network[br]and protest until our demands are met.

00:12:43.33,00:12:46.50
New York, here we come!

00:12:52.01,00:12:55.34
We are spreading the word[br]to this establishment...

00:12:55.51,00:13:00.61
...that we demand better television[br]for our children.

00:13:01.02,00:13:05.48
We want more quality television[br]like Full House.

00:13:07.93,00:13:13.73
- I think you gave me the stomach flu.[br]- No, it was that little Kenny bastard.

00:13:14.23,00:13:18.86
- Mary, you making gravy in there?[br]- I just had a brown baby boy.

00:13:23.11,00:13:29.10
- This is sweet without parents around.[br]- I hope they protest TV shows forever.

00:13:29.35,00:13:33.15
- Billy, I wanna show you something.[br]- Do I have to?

00:13:33.35,00:13:35.55
Yes, you do, you little pecker!

00:13:35.75,00:13:38.24
The reason you won't kill me...

00:13:38.46,00:13:41.48
...is because you don't understand[br]how I feel.

00:13:41.93,00:13:47.39
Now I've found a way to show you[br]what it feels like to be Grandpa.

00:13:48.60,00:13:50.53
What are you doing?

00:13:52.67,00:13:55.50
- What are they doing?[br]- I don't know.

00:13:55.71,00:14:00.37
You're about to see what it's like[br]to be as old as me. Are you ready?

00:14:00.58,00:14:02.60
I guess.

00:14:12.82,00:14:16.69
- Okay, you can let me out now.[br]- Not just yet.

00:14:16.89,00:14:19.36
Let me out, Grandpa!

00:14:19.56,00:14:22.26
I can't take it.[br]This music is terrible.

00:14:22.47,00:14:25.90
It's cheesy, but lame[br]and eerily soothing too.

00:14:26.10,00:14:29.63
That's it. Now you know how it feels[br]to be Grandpa.

00:14:33.04,00:14:36.10
Grandpa, I had no idea[br]how bad it was for you.

00:14:36.31,00:14:40.18
- Now I understand.[br]- So now will you kill me, Billy?

00:14:40.39,00:14:42.79
Sure, I will, Grandpa. I will.

00:14:44.42,00:14:48.98
- Our protest isn't working.[br]- It'll work. It has to.

00:14:49.46,00:14:51.89
It's the president of the network.

00:14:52.10,00:14:54.93
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm John Warson.

00:14:55.13,00:14:59.97
I've prepared a statement for you[br]on behalf of the network.

00:15:01.24,00:15:02.90
F* *k you.

00:15:03.84,00:15:06.33
Thank you.[br]If there are any questions...

00:15:06.54,00:15:10.04
...you may direct them[br]to that brick wall over there.

00:15:10.25,00:15:14.58
Hey, you will not get away with this!

00:15:17.42,00:15:21.32
That does it,[br]no more Mr. Nice Protesters.

00:15:21.53,00:15:23.89
It's time for plan B.

00:15:24.86,00:15:27.85
Carol, where are the porta potties?

00:15:28.07,00:15:32.06
Over there. You need to drop[br]some friends off at the pool?

00:15:32.27,00:15:34.93
Yes indeedy.

00:15:36.64,00:15:39.74
Okay, all you have to do is sit there.

00:15:39.94,00:15:42.64
- You got the cow all tied up?[br]- All done.

00:15:43.15,00:15:45.38
Okay, come on, guys.

00:15:46.75,00:15:50.15
- Why don't we shoot him?[br]- It has to look natural...

00:15:50.35,00:15:53.02
...or else we'll get busted.[br]- Yeah, stupid.

00:15:53.39,00:15:57.59
That's good, Billy,[br]a little higher now.

00:15:58.06,00:16:01.03
The network is not taking us seriously.

00:16:01.23,00:16:05.46
In the past, people have had to die[br]for what they believed in.

00:16:05.67,00:16:10.27
We are prepared to do the same.[br]Ready?

00:16:10.48,00:16:15.85
Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr[br]to us all. Godspeed.

00:16:16.05,00:16:21.78
We will not let these corporate[br]half-wits ruin our children's minds.

00:16:21.99,00:16:23.42
Launch!

00:16:27.26,00:16:33.25
We will all follow suit, one by one[br]if that's what it takes.

00:16:34.30,00:16:38.83
- Are you ready, Grandpa?[br]- Does a pope crap in the woods?

00:16:39.57,00:16:43.23
Code six. 1 05 northbound, Route 52.

00:16:47.61,00:16:49.41
Carry on.

00:16:50.18,00:16:53.34
Okay, here we go.[br]Bye, it was nice knowing you.

00:16:53.55,00:16:55.35
Cut the damn rope, already!

00:16:56.49,00:16:58.51
What is that?

00:16:58.79,00:17:02.19
It looks like Death.

00:17:03.76,00:17:07.39
It's about time,[br]you lazy-ass son of a whore!

00:17:07.60,00:17:10.47
Come on, let's go![br]What the...?

00:17:11.27,00:17:15.54
- Hey, he's coming towards us.[br]- Why is Death coming after us?

00:17:21.18,00:17:24.01
- Help![br]- Run, run, run!

00:17:25.72,00:17:27.81
What are we gonna do?

00:17:28.25,00:17:31.48
As the day progresses,[br]more South Park residents...

00:17:31.69,00:17:36.39
...slingshot their bodies into the side[br]of the Toon Central building.

00:17:36.59,00:17:40.12
Toon Central is now[br]under incredible pressure...

00:17:40.33,00:17:43.70
...and has already lost 20%[br]of their sponsors.

00:17:44.20,00:17:47.19
- Here, I think it's your boy.[br]- Thanks.

00:17:47.41,00:17:50.10
What is it?[br]Did you break something?

00:17:50.31,00:17:53.68
Mom, Death is here![br]He's trying to take us away!

00:17:53.88,00:17:56.28
You need to leave Mommy alone.

00:17:56.48,00:17:59.92
I'm doing something important[br]for your well-being.

00:18:00.12,00:18:02.48
- But, Mom...![br]- Talk to your father.

00:18:02.69,00:18:04.85
- Is the heat on?[br]- Death's coming!

00:18:05.06,00:18:07.89
Keep it under 70.[br]Take care of Grandpa.

00:18:10.39,00:18:14.30
If parents worried less[br]about what their kids watch on TV...

00:18:14.50,00:18:18.96
...and worried more about their kids'[br]lives, things would be better.

00:18:19.17,00:18:24.61
Parents get offended because they rely[br]on TV as a babysitter and educator.

00:18:34.79,00:18:36.84
- Totally, dude.[br]- Good point.

00:18:37.86,00:18:40.59
Quick, jump through the window!

00:18:46.16,00:18:49.93
Come back here,[br]you pompous son of a pansy!

00:18:51.07,00:18:53.90
Don't let him touch you, or you'll die.

00:18:54.11,00:18:56.30
I'm over here, son of a whore!

00:19:01.28,00:19:04.98
Terrance, what color is the wind?

00:19:06.08,00:19:09.28
I don't know. Why don't you check?

00:19:09.69,00:19:13.65
You farted! Oh, my!

00:19:14.43,00:19:17.05
Know what my space suit smells like?

00:19:17.23,00:19:23.22
- No, Terrance, why don't you tell me?[br]- Well, it smells like a dirty fart.

00:19:25.37,00:19:26.39
Hey, look!

00:19:27.84,00:19:29.36
There's one.

00:19:32.94,00:19:35.57
The die-hard South Park parents...

00:19:35.78,00:19:40.44
...are still killing themselves[br]in front of the Toon Central building.

00:19:40.65,00:19:44.52
Worse yet, the stomach flu[br]that is going around is...

00:19:44.69,00:19:49.89
Wait. The president of the network[br]is going to make a statement.

00:19:51.46,00:19:53.69
- Wait, wait.[br]- Ladies and gentlemen...

00:19:53.90,00:19:58.80
...your Nazi-ass tactics of trying to[br]stink us out with your rancid feces...

00:19:59.00,00:20:01.23
...has worked.

00:20:02.31,00:20:06.87
We will be taking Terrance and Phillip[br]off the network...

00:20:07.08,00:20:12.48
...and replacing it with She's the[br]Sheriff, starring Suzanne Somers.

00:20:12.68,00:20:16.45
Now get away from here[br]and take your diarrhea with you.

00:20:19.46,00:20:22.36
Now, at last, we can return[br]to normality.

00:20:22.56,00:20:24.53
- Hey, Phillip.[br]- Yes, Terrance?

00:20:24.73,00:20:29.67
- Is there a penny stuck in my butt?[br]- I don't know, let me check.

00:20:29.87,00:20:34.13
Don't look there, Phillip,[br]you're gonna get farted on.

00:20:35.54,00:20:38.98
We interrupt this program[br]to bring you loud static.

00:20:45.65,00:20:49.59
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]You bastard.

00:20:49.79,00:20:52.69
I guess Death was just coming[br]after Kenny.

00:20:52.89,00:20:56.59
Hey, you were supposed to kill me.

00:20:56.79,00:20:58.59
That's not fair, goddamn it!

00:20:58.80,00:21:02.76
My grandpa asked me to kill him,[br]and I did it.

00:21:06.04,00:21:09.44
Billy...

00:21:09.64,00:21:12.54
- Grandpa?[br]- That's right, Billy.

00:21:12.74,00:21:17.18
My name's not Billy, Grandpa.[br]Why do you look all haggard?

00:21:17.38,00:21:21.08
I asked you to kill me, Billy,[br]but I was wrong.

00:21:21.29,00:21:25.59
- Now I'm spending eternity in limbo.[br]- Limbo?

00:21:25.79,00:21:28.49
I was wrong to put you[br]in that position.

00:21:28.69,00:21:31.99
Just like you're wrong[br]to put little Billy in it.

00:21:32.20,00:21:36.90
You're so obsessed with ending your[br]life, you're not thinking about his.

00:21:37.07,00:21:42.73
- Wait to die of natural causes.[br]- But I've been waiting for 25 years!

00:21:42.94,00:21:47.00
Let nature run its course[br]or else end up in limbo.

00:21:47.21,00:21:52.67
Natural causes, Billy, natural causes.

00:21:55.69,00:21:58.25
Come on you guys, let's go home.

00:22:05.23,00:22:07.46
- Here they are.[br]- We did it, son.

00:22:07.67,00:22:11.23
- We won a battle for your well-being.[br]- What?

00:22:11.44,00:22:13.90
We got Terrance and Phillip canceled.

00:22:14.24,00:22:18.44
- You son of a bitch, your mom sucks![br]- But look what they put on.

00:22:19.41,00:22:24.18
- And now back to She's the Sheriff.[br]- No! God, no!

00:22:24.38,00:22:29.41
- You were behind all the shenanigans.[br]- You're the stupid ho who started it.

00:22:29.75,00:22:31.24
What did he say?

00:22:31.46,00:22:34.58
- Up yours, butt-munch.[br]- What?!

00:22:34.79,00:22:38.25
Come on, everybody, back to New York.

00:22:38.46,00:22:42.52
Hey, Stan, now what are we gonna do[br]for entertainment?

00:22:42.73,00:22:48.10
- We could start breathing gas fumes.[br]- My uncle says smoking crack is cool.

00:22:48.31,00:22:51.74
Why don't we go watch[br]those porno movie thingies?

00:22:52.91,00:22:56.37
- What are you doing, Grandpa?[br]- I'm going to Africa.

00:22:56.58,00:23:02.04
Over 400 people are eaten naturally[br]by lions in Africa every year.

00:23:02.25,00:23:05.09
That's my silly grandpa.
