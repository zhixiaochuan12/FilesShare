- Hi, I'm Trey Parker.[br]- I'm Matt. Matt Stone, that is.

00:00:30.57,00:00:33.63
You nut. You just caught us[br]doing what we love to do most...

00:00:33.84,00:00:38.21
...entertaining senior citizens.[br]Say "hi" to the South Park fans.

00:00:38.41,00:00:42.08
- Say "hi" to the South Park fans![br]- Hi.

00:00:42.28,00:00:47.05
This episode is called "Cartman's Mom[br]is a Dirty Slut." It's our favorite.

00:00:47.25,00:00:51.82
- It's what we call a cliffhanger.[br]- Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:00:52.03,00:00:55.15
- My chest hurts. I need my medication.[br]- You mean this?

00:00:55.36,00:00:58.16
- Yes, of course.[br]- Do the dog dance.

00:00:58.37,00:01:00.77
I don't wanna do the dog dance.

00:01:00.97,00:01:02.96
- Dog dance.[br]- Dog dance.

00:01:03.17,00:01:05.07
- Bark, bark...[br]- Good.

00:01:05.27,00:01:08.40
This episode is about a[br]boy's search for his father.

00:01:08.61,00:01:11.64
And a videotape[br]that might embarrass him.

00:01:11.85,00:01:14.94
- Can I have my medication now?[br]- Beep like a Jeep.

00:01:15.15,00:01:16.88
Yeah, beep like a Jeep.

00:01:17.08,00:01:19.38
- Beep, beep...[br]- That's it.

00:01:19.59,00:01:23.22
So now sit back and enjoy[br]"Matt's Mom is a Dirty Slut."

00:01:23.42,00:01:26.82
- Cartman's mom![br]- Right, right.

00:01:58.53,00:02:00.79
Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut

00:02:03.16,00:02:05.69
Cartman's not showing up for school.

00:02:05.90,00:02:10.03
Yeah, this is the third day in a row.[br]I wonder what's wrong.

00:02:11.54,00:02:15.77
- Yeah.[br]- Hey, maybe we should go check on him.

00:02:16.08,00:02:19.71
- Come on, we're running late.[br]- We're not getting on, you ugly bitch.

00:02:19.91,00:02:21.28
What did you say?!

00:02:21.48,00:02:24.11
I said,[br]we're not getting on, you ugly bitch.

00:02:24.32,00:02:27.05
Oh, all right then.

00:02:28.02,00:02:30.18
- Whoa, dude.[br]- I always wondered if that would work.

00:02:32.93,00:02:35.59
- Hello, boys.[br]- We were wondering why fat ass...

00:02:35.80,00:02:39.89
- I mean Cartman, isn't at school.[br]- He's under the weather.

00:02:40.10,00:02:42.16
Maybe you boys[br]can cheer him up.

00:02:42.37,00:02:45.00
- He's in the back yard.[br]- In the back yard?

00:02:46.07,00:02:48.70
Would you like more tea,[br]Polly Prissypants?

00:02:48.91,00:02:54.91
- I would love some tea, thank you.[br]- You're welcome, Polly Prissypants.

00:02:56.02,00:02:59.32
- Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?[br]- Yes, please.

00:02:59.52,00:03:04.22
- Why are you so cool?[br]- I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.

00:03:04.42,00:03:08.19
Yeah, you're strong and smart.[br]Everybody likes you.

00:03:08.40,00:03:11.56
Thank you, Polly Prissypants.[br]How nice of you.

00:03:12.13,00:03:15.16
Dude, this is pretty f* *ked up[br]right here.

00:03:15.64,00:03:18.73
- Let's go make fun of him.[br]- No, this looks really serious.

00:03:18.94,00:03:21.97
- I think we better get help.[br]- Really?

00:03:22.38,00:03:27.14
Eric, you are the coolest guy[br]in the world. This is tremendous tea.

00:03:27.35,00:03:30.54
Why, thank you, Peter Panda.[br]It's a distinctive Earl Grey.

00:03:30.75,00:03:33.48
- Eric is the best.[br]- Hurray for Eric.

00:03:33.69,00:03:35.18
Eric kicks ass.

00:03:36.29,00:03:38.52
Mr. Mackey, something's wrong[br]with Cartman.

00:03:38.73,00:03:42.46
- There's a news flash.[br]- We saw him having a tea party...

00:03:42.66,00:03:46.26
...with his stuffed animals.[br]- He was doing their voices.

00:03:46.47,00:03:52.23
Eric is obviously suffering from some[br]kind of emotional distress, m'kay?

00:03:52.44,00:03:56.77
- What do you mean?[br]- Has anything troubled him recently?

00:03:56.98,00:04:01.00
- No.[br]- Well, something is bothering him.

00:04:01.21,00:04:04.84
Oh, of course, my video camera.

00:04:05.05,00:04:07.99
If you could videotape[br]Eric's behavior...

00:04:08.19,00:04:12.72
...then I can study him psychologically[br]and find out what's wrong, m'kay?

00:04:12.93,00:04:15.02
- Is that legal?[br]- Oh, hell yes.

00:04:15.43,00:04:19.23
That's a lovely dress[br]you are wearing, Polly Prissypants.

00:04:19.43,00:04:22.40
Thank you, Eric.[br]You are a perfect gentleman.

00:04:22.60,00:04:27.84
- You are smart and cool.[br]- Yes, you are strong, smart and cool.

00:04:28.04,00:04:31.84
- Everybody likes you.[br]- That's nice, Peter Panda.

00:04:32.05,00:04:35.38
- This will be the funniest tape ever.[br]- How much do we need?

00:04:35.58,00:04:37.07
Just keep rolling.

00:04:37.28,00:04:40.31
- More tea, Rumper Tumpskin?[br]- Yes, please.

00:04:40.52,00:04:42.39
You are tough and handsome.

00:04:42.59,00:04:46.46
Thank you. What do you think[br]about me, Clyde Frog?

00:04:46.66,00:04:50.03
I think you're[br]a big, fat piece of crap.

00:04:56.57,00:04:59.37
No, Kitty,[br]this is my corned beef cabbage.

00:04:59.57,00:05:02.10
No, Kitty! That's a bad Kitty!

00:05:02.31,00:05:06.97
- How is your beefy roast, snookums?[br]- Mom, can I ask you a question?

00:05:07.18,00:05:11.48
- Sure, hon.[br]- You know how Stan has a dad?

00:05:12.89,00:05:16.65
And Kyle has a dad?[br]And Kenny has a dad?

00:05:16.86,00:05:19.19
Yes?

00:05:25.77,00:05:30.83
- Well, what's your question, hon?[br]- Goddamn it, do I have a dad?

00:05:31.14,00:05:34.07
I wanna know where I came from.

00:05:34.71,00:05:36.47
Well, you see, Eric...

00:05:36.68,00:05:40.94
...sometimes when a man and a woman[br]are attracted to each other...

00:05:41.15,00:05:44.84
...they want to be close[br]to each other.

00:05:45.25,00:05:48.69
And sometimes the man[br]puts his hoo-hoo-dilly...

00:05:48.89,00:05:51.98
...in the woman's cha-cha.

00:05:56.73,00:05:59.46
Who put his hoo-hoo-dilly[br]in your cha-cha?

00:05:59.67,00:06:03.83
Eric, the day I met your father,[br]it was like magic.

00:06:04.04,00:06:08.44
It was a beautiful autumn night,[br]when the aspen trees were turning...

00:06:08.64,00:06:12.77
...at the 1 2th Annual[br]Drunken Barn Dance.

00:06:17.35,00:06:20.18
I was young and naive then.

00:06:20.35,00:06:24.15
I've never seen a woman drink so much.[br]You're amazing, Miss Cartman.

00:06:24.32,00:06:27.73
Heck, I haven't even started yet.

00:06:27.93,00:06:30.73
I baked cookies.[br]Would anybody like one?

00:06:30.90,00:06:34.46
I wouldn't mind getting ahold[br]of your cookies.

00:06:34.67,00:06:39.73
Well, go right ahead,[br]Officer Barbrady.

00:06:40.01,00:06:43.17
That's a good cookie.

00:06:44.48,00:06:49.18
Come on, everybody,[br]let's do the drunken barn dance.

00:06:56.69,00:06:59.42
And then I saw him.

00:06:59.63,00:07:05.19
He was the most beautiful piece of ass[br]I'd ever seen in South Park.

00:07:05.40,00:07:08.49
His name was Chief Running Water.

00:07:22.95,00:07:25.71
I don't recall[br]the rest of the night...

00:07:25.92,00:07:31.41
...but the next morning, I was pregnant[br]with you, my little blueberry muffin.

00:07:31.62,00:07:34.46
Where is Chief Running...?[br]I mean Dad, now?

00:07:34.66,00:07:39.86
I never saw him after that.[br]I wasn't really that interested in him.

00:07:40.07,00:07:42.13
That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.

00:07:42.34,00:07:46.47
I heard he still lives on the Ute[br]reservation outside of town.

00:07:46.67,00:07:51.20
Wow, to think all this time[br]I'm actually a naive American.

00:07:51.41,00:07:53.14
No, Kitty! That's a bad Kitty!

00:07:55.75,00:08:01.52
Coming this Sunday, a television[br]event that will blow you away.

00:08:01.72,00:08:06.56
Terrance. Phillip.[br]In the harrowing made-for-TV drama...

00:08:06.76,00:08:09.89
...Not Without My Anus.[br]Based on a true story.

00:08:10.10,00:08:13.09
I have to go to Iraq and find[br]my kidnapped daughter.

00:08:13.30,00:08:16.36
Then I'm going[br]to go with you, Terrance.

00:08:17.90,00:08:21.77
See Canada's hottest stars[br]in the HBC Movie of the Week.

00:08:21.98,00:08:24.88
Dude, we have to tape[br]Not Without My Anus.

00:08:25.08,00:08:27.88
Yeah, dude, it looks riveting.

00:08:28.42,00:08:31.94
- We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.[br]- No, Billy...

00:08:32.15,00:08:34.81
...we're gonna watch[br]the Bob Saget show.

00:08:35.02,00:08:39.98
And now, America's Stupidest Home[br]Videos. Here's your host, Bob Saget.

00:08:40.19,00:08:43.99
I just flew into the studio.[br]Boy, are my arms tired.

00:08:45.30,00:08:49.74
Why didn't the skeleton cross the road?[br]He didn't have the guts.

00:08:50.10,00:08:51.66
Knock, knock.

00:08:51.87,00:08:53.50
Bob.

00:08:53.71,00:08:55.80
Bob Saget.

00:08:58.91,00:09:01.01
- This guy sucks.[br]- He's almost as bad...

00:09:01.21,00:09:03.24
...as that guy on Full House.

00:09:03.85,00:09:07.08
Cartman? What are you doing dressed[br]up like an Indian with a bear necklace?

00:09:07.29,00:09:10.78
Naive American, Stan.[br]The bear is important to my people.

00:09:10.99,00:09:12.75
What?

00:09:13.26,00:09:18.66
The white man has mocked my people[br]long enough. Keep your mouths shut!

00:09:18.87,00:09:23.27
- I need to bike to the reservation.[br]- What are you talking about?

00:09:23.47,00:09:27.70
My name is Eric Running Water.[br]Now, can I borrow your bike?

00:09:27.91,00:09:30.81
- Or do I have to steal it?[br]- Go ahead, dude.

00:09:31.01,00:09:35.85
- He's more screwed up than I thought.[br]- Let's get this video to Mr. Mackey.

00:09:36.05,00:09:39.38
Just a reminder,[br]send us your stupidest home videos.

00:09:39.59,00:09:42.78
The grand prize this month[br]will be for $ 1 0,000.

00:09:42.99,00:09:48.99
- Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes![br]- I wish we had a stupidest home video.

00:09:55.10,00:09:59.09
- And bear cried to eagle...[br]- Running Water, some kid's here.

00:09:59.31,00:10:01.27
- What kid?[br]- He says he's your kid.

00:10:01.47,00:10:03.44
- Hi, Dad.[br]- Who are you?

00:10:03.64,00:10:08.60
I'm your son, Eric. You put your[br]hoo-hoo-dilly in my mom's cha-cha.

00:10:08.82,00:10:10.75
- Your mother?[br]- Liane Cartman.

00:10:10.95,00:10:14.68
Cartman? Oh, boy, I was worried[br]there for a second.

00:10:14.89,00:10:18.72
- I'm not your father.[br]- But you were the guy she was with.

00:10:18.93,00:10:23.42
I hate to break this to you, but your[br]mother is what we refer to as...

00:10:23.76,00:10:26.49
..."bear with wide canyon."[br]- What do you mean?

00:10:26.70,00:10:30.19
She is "doe who cannot[br]keep legs together."

00:10:30.40,00:10:32.30
- Your mom's a slut.[br]- Hey!

00:10:32.51,00:10:36.03
Your mom was too drunk[br]to remember what happened.

00:10:36.24,00:10:37.94
Let me tell you.

00:10:40.31,00:10:44.15
We got tired of dancing,[br]so we found a private spot.

00:10:44.35,00:10:47.95
I knew she wanted me.[br]She kept saying romantic things.

00:10:48.15,00:10:54.06
- Chief, I want your hot man-chowder.[br]- Whoa, hello!

00:10:55.93,00:11:00.96
Wait, wait. Who is that?

00:11:10.64,00:11:15.77
- Could you excuse me for a minute?[br]- You gotta be kidding me.

00:11:15.98,00:11:20.18
Why, hello there. I don't think[br]I've seen you around before.

00:11:20.39,00:11:24.98
- No, I'm new in town.[br]- What's a nice, handsome...

00:11:25.19,00:11:29.63
...black man like yourself[br]doing in a pit like South Park?

00:11:29.83,00:11:34.10
- I'm gonna open up a restaurant here.[br]- My, how exciting.

00:11:34.30,00:11:37.10
Care to put your tongue[br]in my mouth?

00:11:37.30,00:11:40.57
Damn, baby,[br]you cut right to the chase.

00:11:40.77,00:11:43.26
I'm plastered!

00:11:44.44,00:11:47.28
His tongue? Chef? Chef is my dad?

00:11:47.48,00:11:50.07
He's the last person[br]I saw with your mom.

00:11:50.45,00:11:54.51
Oh, my God.[br]I'm a black African-American.

00:11:58.46,00:12:00.59
Come on, get the go-cart going.

00:12:00.79,00:12:04.29
- Did you send the videotape?[br]- I mailed it last night.

00:12:04.50,00:12:07.49
What sucks is now we have[br]to watch Bob Saget.

00:12:07.70,00:12:12.26
- Lf we win, we can buy a new go-cart.[br]- Here comes Cartman.

00:12:12.47,00:12:14.27
What's up, homeys?

00:12:14.47,00:12:17.93
I was just kicking it[br]with some G's on the west side.

00:12:18.14,00:12:22.77
- You live on the east side.[br]- I thought you were Native American.

00:12:24.18,00:12:27.41
Right, like I'm some hippie Indian.

00:12:27.62,00:12:33.08
You know what I'm saying, G? Check you[br]later. I'm gonna go chill with my dad.

00:12:34.09,00:12:39.05
Dude, we should be videotaping this.[br]We could make another $ 1 0,000.

00:12:41.67,00:12:43.86
Hold on, Kenny!

00:13:01.29,00:13:04.88
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]- You bastards!

00:13:07.86,00:13:10.49
- Hello?[br]- Yo, Pops.

00:13:10.70,00:13:16.29
- Boy, what the fudge are you doing?[br]- Just laying down some rhymes.

00:13:16.50,00:13:19.40
- Get in here![br]- West side.

00:13:19.61,00:13:23.17
- What's gotten into you?[br]- You're my dad, Chef.

00:13:23.38,00:13:26.97
You got together with my mom[br]at the Drunken Barn Dance.

00:13:27.18,00:13:30.38
What? No! Did I?

00:13:30.58,00:13:33.98
You kissed her[br]with your tongue.

00:13:34.32,00:13:38.52
Women don't get pregnant[br]from tongue kissing, children.

00:13:38.73,00:13:41.32
- So you're not my dad?[br]- Of course not.

00:13:41.53,00:13:46.93
Here, you children sit down and let me[br]explain about where babies come from.

00:13:47.13,00:13:50.86
Then you'll see why[br]I can't be your dad.

00:13:57.61,00:14:00.04
Actually, sometimes a man[br]doesn't love a woman...

00:14:00.25,00:14:03.77
...but he acts like he does[br]to get some action.

00:14:55.90,00:14:59.00
What? Who the hell did that to my mom[br]at the Drunken Barn Dance?

00:14:59.21,00:15:04.40
Children, that was a long time ago,[br]but I'll tell you what I remember.

00:15:07.91,00:15:10.85
Chef, you're so strong.

00:15:11.05,00:15:15.28
Hey everybody, look who's here,[br]the AFC Champion Denver Broncos.

00:15:15.66,00:15:19.11
- Are we late for the party?[br]- What town is this?

00:15:32.27,00:15:36.97
- Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?[br]- Whoopee!

00:15:37.91,00:15:42.14
- Garrison, what are you doing?[br]- You're drunk, Mr. Hat.

00:15:46.29,00:15:48.95
Oh, man, I'm out of here.

00:15:49.16,00:15:53.18
Come on, Chef, haven't you heard[br]of a "manage oh three"?

00:15:53.39,00:15:56.16
Yeah, when two women are involved.

00:15:56.36,00:16:01.93
Damn! Damn! I guess it will just have[br]to be you and me, Miss Cartman.

00:16:02.13,00:16:05.47
And that's who she was with last:[br]Mr. Garrison.

00:16:05.67,00:16:10.37
No. No. No, God, no!

00:16:11.68,00:16:14.41
And now,[br]America's Stupidest Home Videos.

00:16:14.61,00:16:17.88
Here's a video that shows[br]a very disturbed boy.

00:16:18.08,00:16:21.58
Thank you, Polly Prissypants.[br]You are my best friend.

00:16:21.79,00:16:26.82
You are one of the coolest people[br]in the world, and you are not fat.

00:16:27.03,00:16:30.99
- Really, you don't think so?[br]- No, you're not fat.

00:16:32.97,00:16:36.90
Stanley, we just heard[br]that your little friend Kenny...

00:16:37.10,00:16:40.73
...was killed by a train.[br]- Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:16:40.94,00:16:43.50
Is there anything we can do for you?

00:16:43.71,00:16:45.68
- How about ice cream?[br]- Yeah, with butterscotch.

00:16:45.88,00:16:50.71
- You bet, you poor dears.[br]- Now the moment you've waited for...

00:16:50.92,00:16:55.95
...when one of our lucky videos[br]qualifies for the $ 1 0,000 grand prize.

00:16:56.16,00:16:57.78
The winner is:

00:16:57.99,00:17:01.32
- "Little Boy's Tea Party. "[br]- We're in the finals.

00:17:01.53,00:17:04.83
- We're gonna win $ 1 0,000.[br]- Cartman will be famous.

00:17:06.77,00:17:11.86
- I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.[br]- One more cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.

00:17:12.07,00:17:17.74
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a[br]drinking problem. Another cosmo.

00:17:18.95,00:17:22.11
All this time...[br]Why didn't you tell me, Father?

00:17:22.32,00:17:25.55
- What are you talking about, Eric?[br]- It was you.

00:17:25.75,00:17:29.65
You were with my mother[br]at the Drunken Barn Dance.

00:17:29.86,00:17:33.76
- Garrison? Impossible, he's gay.[br]- I'm not gay!

00:17:33.96,00:17:35.76
Then you slept with my mom?

00:17:35.96,00:17:39.26
- He's gay.[br]- Okay, okay, I admit it.

00:17:39.47,00:17:44.84
I might have made love to your mother[br]at the dance, but who here didn't?

00:17:45.67,00:17:50.90
Now come on, honestly, who here[br]has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?

00:17:57.85,00:18:00.18
- I haven't.[br]- You don't count, Halfy.

00:18:00.39,00:18:03.01
- You don't have any legs.[br]- Oh, yeah.

00:18:03.22,00:18:09.22
Anyone here could be your father.[br]I'm afraid you're never going to know.

00:18:11.03,00:18:15.52
Don't feel too bad, kid.[br]I never knew who my father was either.

00:18:15.74,00:18:19.80
I mean, I knew who he was,[br]and we had great times together...

00:18:20.01,00:18:22.94
Well, hell, you know what I mean!

00:18:27.58,00:18:30.98
- Wait, I know a way to find out.[br]- How?

00:18:31.18,00:18:33.81
At my lab, we can do DNA[br]genetic testing.

00:18:34.02,00:18:38.35
I'll take blood from you and everyone[br]here and we can learn who your dad is.

00:18:38.56,00:18:40.99
- Really? You can?[br]- Yes, of course.

00:18:41.19,00:18:43.75
The testing will cost a pretty penny.

00:18:43.96,00:18:45.99
- How much?[br]- Three thousand.

00:18:46.20,00:18:50.93
- I don't have $3,000.[br]- Oh, never mind.

00:18:52.97,00:18:56.20
Dude, I can't wait[br]to win that $ 1 0,000.

00:18:56.41,00:19:00.81
- I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart.[br]- I'm gonna buy a Walkman.

00:19:01.01,00:19:02.84
- Hey, guys.[br]- How's it going?

00:19:03.05,00:19:06.92
Fine. How are you guys?

00:19:07.12,00:19:12.61
- Dude, what the hell is wrong?[br]- Nothing. It's just, nothing.

00:19:12.83,00:19:16.28
- What's the matter?[br]- I wanna know who my dad is...

00:19:16.50,00:19:20.96
...but to find out, they have[br]to do DNA tests and they cost $3,000.

00:19:21.17,00:19:25.87
- And I don't have $3,000.[br]- Wow, we're sorry your mom's a whore.

00:19:26.07,00:19:30.48
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know[br]who my father is, I just have to.

00:19:30.68,00:19:33.54
Maybe I can work in a[br]sweatshop for a while...

00:19:33.75,00:19:37.65
Well, see you guys.[br]I'm gonna go play in my back yard.

00:19:37.85,00:19:41.58
- We know how you can get $3,000.[br]- You do?

00:19:41.79,00:19:45.55
We're in the finals[br]for America's Stupidest Home Videos.

00:19:45.76,00:19:49.25
If we win, we'll give you 3,000[br]of our $ 1 0,000 prize.

00:19:49.46,00:19:52.30
You will? Wow, you guys are the best.

00:19:52.50,00:19:54.69
- Thanks, you guys.[br]- Yeah.

00:19:55.00,00:19:58.06
And now back to[br]America's Stupidest Home Videos.

00:19:58.27,00:20:01.50
- What kind of video did you make?[br]- You'll see.

00:20:01.71,00:20:04.64
It's time to crown the $ 1 0,000 winner.

00:20:04.84,00:20:06.84
It's down to three videos.

00:20:07.05,00:20:10.54
First, it's "Dog Who Puts Hat[br]on Master's Head."

00:20:10.75,00:20:13.74
I'm a little dog.[br]I'm just a little dog.

00:20:13.95,00:20:17.22
But I've gotta put a hat[br]on my master's head.

00:20:20.16,00:20:24.06
Now, our second finalist,[br]"Little Boy Has a Tea Party."

00:20:24.26,00:20:27.16
Polly Prissypants,[br]you are my best friend.

00:20:27.37,00:20:29.96
Thank you, Eric.

00:20:30.17,00:20:33.63
Boy, looks like this kid[br]needs some therapy.

00:20:33.84,00:20:36.14
We're sure to win, Cartman.[br]Then you'll get your DNA money.

00:20:36.34,00:20:42.08
I am so pissed off right now.

00:20:42.28,00:20:45.08
They laughed hardest at our video.[br]We're gonna win!

00:20:45.28,00:20:48.85
And, finally,[br]"Young Child Gets Hit by a Train."

00:20:49.05,00:20:55.05
I'm such a cute little kid. I wonder[br]if I can get this go-cart started.

00:21:00.37,00:21:04.56
I hope I don't get hit by a train.[br]I sure did.

00:21:05.87,00:21:09.31
- Oh, my God, they taped killing Kenny![br]- You bastards!

00:21:09.51,00:21:13.21
Now, that's what I call a joy ride.

00:21:13.41,00:21:18.44
And the winner is, naturally,[br]"Little Boy Being Hit by a Train."

00:21:19.05,00:21:20.78
- Dude, we lost.[br]- Damn it!

00:21:20.99,00:21:26.72
I am going to f* *king[br]kill you guys, seriously!

00:21:26.93,00:21:28.76
Take a bow, Mr. Marsh.

00:21:28.96,00:21:31.26
- I won, I won.[br]- Grandpa!

00:21:31.46,00:21:37.10
Our other finalists will get $3,000[br]runner-up prizes. See you next time.

00:21:37.30,00:21:41.33
Hear that? We get $3,000.[br]That's enough for your DNA tests.

00:21:41.54,00:21:46.48
Kill you guys.[br]Kill you guys!

00:21:49.92,00:21:53.98
From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed[br]down Eric's possible father...

00:21:54.19,00:21:59.02
...to the people in this room:[br]Officer Barbrady, Chef, Jimbo...

00:21:59.23,00:22:02.32
...Mr. Garrison, Ned,[br]Chief Running Water...

00:22:02.53,00:22:05.86
...Gerald Broflovski, myself,[br]my friend Kevin...

00:22:06.07,00:22:08.97
...or the 1 989 Denver Broncos.

00:22:09.17,00:22:11.97
I knew Cartman's mom was a slut,[br]but goddamn!

00:22:12.17,00:22:14.47
The results are in this envelope.

00:22:14.67,00:22:19.84
- Shall I open it?[br]- Yes, for God's sake, get on with it.

00:22:20.05,00:22:23.50
The father of Eric Cartman[br]is indeed someone in this room.

00:22:23.72,00:22:27.15
- The father is...[br]- Who is Eric Cartman's father?

00:22:27.35,00:22:30.95
Is it Chief Running Water?[br]Or is it Chef?

00:22:31.16,00:22:34.75
Is it Mephisto,[br]or that little monkey guy?

00:22:34.96,00:22:37.43
- Or is it Mr. Garrison?[br]- No, he's gay.

00:22:37.63,00:22:41.69
- You go to hell and you die![br]- Is it Jimbo?

00:22:41.90,00:22:44.89
- Or is it Officer Barbrady?[br]- Huh? Where?

00:22:45.10,00:22:47.13
- Or could it be Ned?[br]- Could be.

00:22:47.34,00:22:50.60
- Or Mr. Broflovski?[br]- Dad, how could you?

00:22:50.81,00:22:53.87
Or is it the 1 991 Denver Broncos?

00:22:54.08,00:22:58.04
The answer is coming on an all-new[br]South Park in just four weeks.

00:22:58.25,00:23:00.78
What? Son of a bitch!
