- Beefcake![br]- I'll tell you.

00:00:07.48,00:00:09.14
That's a hoot and a holler.

00:00:09.31,00:00:12.55
This next episode[br]is Trey and I's favorite:

00:00:12.72,00:00:14.88
"Big Gay Al's[br]Big Gay Boat Ride."

00:00:15.05,00:00:19.05
In it, Stan finds out that[br]his dog Sparky is a homosexual.

00:00:19.22,00:00:22.59
How did your preoccupation[br]with homosexuality develop?

00:00:22.76,00:00:26.32
We've seen that America[br]is preoccupied with gayness.

00:00:26.50,00:00:30.13
But there's a part of homosexuality[br]that's unexplored...

00:00:30.30,00:00:33.14
...and that's animal homosexuality.

00:00:33.34,00:00:35.57
People are curious about you two.

00:00:35.74,00:00:39.61
Are you guys a... A couple,[br]if you know what I mean?

00:00:39.78,00:00:41.77
You mean, are we gay?

00:00:41.95,00:00:43.51
Yeah.

00:00:44.45,00:00:47.85
- Well, I am, a little.[br]- We're all a little gay.

00:00:48.02,00:00:49.99
Even old Scratch here.

00:00:50.96,00:00:56.33
What kind of stuff do you get[br]in the mail from fans in general?

00:00:56.50,00:00:59.33
We have great fans[br]and great fan mail.

00:00:59.50,00:01:02.90
People write such fascinating[br]things every week.

00:01:03.07,00:01:05.37
Let me give you an example.

00:01:05.90,00:01:09.57
"Dear Trey and Matt,[br]I like your show."

00:01:10.28,00:01:13.34
That's from Tom in New Jersey.

00:01:13.51,00:01:16.54
Why does Kenny die[br]so often and so horribly?

00:01:16.72,00:01:19.48
- Because he's poor.[br]- Because he's poor.

00:01:19.65,00:01:23.25
Is there stuff you put into the show[br]that's subliminal?

00:01:23.42,00:01:26.05
A reward for fans[br]who pay attention?

00:01:26.22,00:01:31.92
We feel we owe it to our fans to put[br]subliminal messages into each episode.

00:01:32.10,00:01:35.33
They can find something new[br]every time they watch.

00:01:35.50,00:01:40.49
In this one, if you look hard, you can[br]see me having sex with Matt's mom.

00:01:40.67,00:01:41.87
What?

00:01:42.04,00:01:48.41
Now sit back, relax and enjoy[br]"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride."

00:02:20.68,00:02:22.74
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride

00:02:23.42,00:02:26.28
Where's the bus?[br]We'll be late for practice.

00:02:26.62,00:02:28.28
- Hi, Sparky.[br]- Who's that?

00:02:28.45,00:02:30.75
My new dog Sparky.[br]He followed me.

00:02:30.92,00:02:33.76
- Wow, cool![br]- Good boy. Who's my best buddy?

00:02:33.93,00:02:37.59
- Who's my buddy?[br]- You're making me sick, dude!

00:02:37.76,00:02:41.16
He's part Doberman and wolf.[br]He's the toughest dog.

00:02:41.33,00:02:46.24
No way! Everybody knows that Sylvester[br]is the toughest dog in South Park.

00:02:47.91,00:02:51.97
- He's not meaner than Sparky![br]- Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!

00:02:52.14,00:02:53.77
Sparky will kick his ass!

00:02:53.95,00:02:57.01
- I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.[br]- You're on!

00:02:57.18,00:03:00.31
That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!

00:03:02.65,00:03:05.05
He's doing something to his ass.

00:03:05.22,00:03:08.56
He's not kicking his ass,[br]but he's doing something.

00:03:08.73,00:03:11.79
Sparky, bad dog!

00:03:11.96,00:03:14.63
- What?![br]- I think your dog is gay.

00:03:14.80,00:03:18.70
- What do you mean?[br]- That dog is a gay homosexual.

00:03:18.87,00:03:20.13
He's just confused.

00:03:20.31,00:03:23.00
The other dog's the one[br]that's confused.

00:03:23.18,00:03:25.80
Sick! Shut up, dude!

00:03:26.28,00:03:30.18
Stan's dog's a homo![br]Stan's dog's a homo!

00:03:30.95,00:03:34.48
Okay, children, I know[br]you're excited and nervous...

00:03:34.65,00:03:37.95
...about the homecoming game[br]against Middle Park.

00:03:38.12,00:03:39.59
- Middle Park?[br]- Homecoming?

00:03:39.76,00:03:41.59
Remember what I taught you:

00:03:41.76,00:03:45.92
That football is like making love[br]to a really beautiful woman.

00:03:46.10,00:03:48.93
You can't always score,[br]but when you do...

00:03:49.10,00:03:52.80
...it makes all the trying worthwhile.

00:03:52.97,00:03:54.70
Now, let's start practice.

00:03:54.87,00:03:57.67
- Mr. Chef, sir?[br]- Yes, Pip, what is it?

00:03:57.84,00:04:02.14
- I still don't have a helmet.[br]- We can't afford helmets for everyone.

00:04:02.31,00:04:05.25
Couldn't we rotate[br]who doesn't have a helmet?

00:04:05.42,00:04:08.88
- Does it always have to be me?[br]- I'm afraid it does.

00:04:09.55,00:04:12.05
Sorry, son. Get your ass in there!

00:04:12.36,00:04:17.62
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.[br]Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

00:04:17.80,00:04:20.23
Hike the damn ball!

00:04:22.83,00:04:26.36
- How's practice coming there, Chef?[br]- Oh, fine.

00:04:26.54,00:04:30.98
I won't remind you how important[br]the game is to us South Park alumni.

00:04:31.14,00:04:34.17
- Elementary alumni?[br]- That's as far as most got.

00:04:34.35,00:04:37.91
Can we beat the spread[br]against Middle Park?

00:04:38.08,00:04:42.85
- I don't know. What's the spread?[br]- Middle Park by 70 points.

00:04:43.02,00:04:45.62
I got it! I got it!

00:04:45.79,00:04:47.59
We don't have a chance.

00:04:47.76,00:04:52.70
Nonsense! Not with my nephew[br]at quarterback. Right, Stanley?

00:04:56.74,00:04:58.93
- Attaboy![br]- Great pass, Stan!

00:04:59.10,00:05:01.94
Ned, we gotta get our asses[br]to the bookie!

00:05:03.64,00:05:08.08
That was a good practice, children.[br]We'll see you here tomorrow.

00:05:08.25,00:05:09.77
Stan, is that your dog?

00:05:09.98,00:05:13.78
He must have followed me.[br]You see, he is smart.

00:05:14.05,00:05:17.85
My dog Rex follows me[br]to football practice all the time.

00:05:18.02,00:05:21.69
But my dog found his own way.[br]That makes him smarter...

00:05:21.86,00:05:25.02
- Sparky, get down![br]- What's he doing to my dog?

00:05:25.20,00:05:27.86
- There he goes again.[br]- Get down, Sparky!

00:05:28.03,00:05:31.13
Stan didn't mention his dog[br]is a gay homosexual.

00:05:31.30,00:05:33.50
Make him stop!

00:05:35.81,00:05:37.90
I'm glad my dog isn't gay.

00:05:38.08,00:05:41.57
Maybe you should name[br]your dog Sparkette, Stan.

00:05:41.75,00:05:43.41
Gay dog.

00:05:44.88,00:05:51.08
So, Simon and Simon were not brothers[br]in real life, only on television.

00:05:51.26,00:05:56.63
Thank you, Eric, but the assignment[br]was on Asian cultures. D minus.

00:05:56.80,00:05:59.92
- Damn it![br]- Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?

00:06:00.10,00:06:03.43
How about Stan, our South Park[br]quarterback star?

00:06:03.60,00:06:06.26
Good idea.[br]Okay, Stanley, you're next.

00:06:06.44,00:06:10.27
- I'm not prepared either.[br]- Make something up, like Eric did.

00:06:10.44,00:06:16.07
Okay. Asian culture has plagued[br]our Earth for years. We must end it...

00:06:16.25,00:06:17.98
Excellent, A minus.

00:06:18.18,00:06:21.74
- Wow, cool![br]- Why the hell does he get an A minus?

00:06:21.92,00:06:26.79
Stanley might lead our team to victory[br]for the first time in decades.

00:06:26.96,00:06:30.72
Athletes are treated better[br]because they're better people.

00:06:30.90,00:06:34.23
- That's not fair![br]- Life isn't fair. Get used to it.

00:06:34.40,00:06:35.76
Stupid puppet.

00:06:35.93,00:06:39.96
Don't forget your assignments.[br]They're due for everyone but Stan.

00:06:40.14,00:06:43.70
- Mr. Garrison, can I ask a question?[br]- What is it?

00:06:43.88,00:06:47.54
- What's a homosexual?[br]- Oh, well, Stanley...

00:06:47.71,00:06:51.44
...I guess you came[br]to the right person. Sit down.

00:06:51.62,00:06:57.52
Stanley, gay people...[br]Well, gay people are evil.

00:06:57.72,00:07:01.49
Evil down to their black hearts,[br]which pump not blood...

00:07:01.66,00:07:05.15
...but a vomitous oil that oozes[br]through their veins...

00:07:05.33,00:07:10.73
...clots in their brains, which causes[br]their Nazi-esque violent behavior.

00:07:10.90,00:07:13.23
- Do you understand?[br]- I guess.

00:07:13.41,00:07:15.64
I'm glad we could have this talk.

00:07:15.81,00:07:20.11
Now you go and practice football[br]like a good little heterosexual.

00:07:21.45,00:07:25.08
You see me block that defense today?[br]I was kicking ass.

00:07:25.25,00:07:28.05
You need to kick more ass[br]to beat the Cowboys.

00:07:28.22,00:07:31.52
Speaking of pounding ass,[br]here comes Stan's homo dog!

00:07:31.69,00:07:36.18
Shut up, dude! Sparky,[br]where'd you get that pink scarf?

00:07:36.36,00:07:38.85
That's the gayest dog[br]I've ever seen.

00:07:39.03,00:07:42.69
He just needs some training,[br]that's all. Sit, Sparky.

00:07:42.87,00:07:45.03
Good boy. Now shake.

00:07:46.30,00:07:49.90
Good boy. Now, don't be gay!

00:07:50.08,00:07:53.24
Don't be gay, Spark.[br]Don't be gay.

00:07:53.41,00:07:55.07
- Did it work?[br]- I don't know.

00:07:55.25,00:07:56.58
He still looks gay.

00:07:57.15,00:08:00.81
Hey, Stan, your dog been[br]to any pride marches lately?

00:08:00.99,00:08:05.42
Yeah, maybe you should take him[br]to a Barbra Streisand concert.

00:08:05.59,00:08:07.49
- Stupid gay dog.[br]- Gay dog.

00:08:07.66,00:08:09.22
Come on. I have an idea.

00:08:15.47,00:08:19.30
- I want $500 on the South Park Cows.[br]- Are you crazy?

00:08:19.47,00:08:22.20
No siree, I tell you, I got the line.

00:08:22.37,00:08:26.07
My nephew's the best quarterback[br]the school's ever seen.

00:08:26.24,00:08:28.74
I guarantee they'll beat the spread.

00:08:28.91,00:08:31.25
I'll put all my money on the Cows.

00:08:31.42,00:08:36.51
- I'll put 300 on the Cows too.[br]- I wanna put money on the Cows too!

00:08:36.69,00:08:39.59
Don't get too carried away now.

00:08:39.76,00:08:45.03
- You better be right about this, Jimbo.[br]- Don't worry yourself.

00:08:45.20,00:08:49.69
- Are you sure Stan is that good?[br]- Not that sure.

00:08:49.87,00:08:52.77
We better come up[br]with a backup plan.

00:08:52.94,00:08:56.63
Let's see... Hey, bookie,[br]what's the halftime show?

00:08:56.81,00:09:01.94
John Stamos' older brother[br]Richard Stamos is singing "Loving You."

00:09:02.11,00:09:05.81
- I love that song.[br]- "Loving You"? That's perfect.

00:09:05.98,00:09:09.98
Middle Park will get a halftime show[br]they'll never forget.

00:09:10.92,00:09:13.82
Sparky, we got you a present.[br]Why don't...?

00:09:13.99,00:09:18.02
Where do you keep getting this?[br]No pink bandanna. Bad dog!

00:09:18.20,00:09:23.03
Now pay attention.[br]Sparky, this is Fifi.

00:09:23.60,00:09:26.13
- There he goes.[br]- Attaboy, get her!

00:09:27.24,00:09:28.97
Yes!

00:09:31.41,00:09:34.40
- Crap! Now what?[br]- Who cares if your dog's gay?

00:09:34.58,00:09:35.81
Maybe it's not bad.

00:09:35.98,00:09:38.71
No way. My mom says[br]God hates gay people.

00:09:38.88,00:09:43.75
That's why he smoked[br]the Sodomies in France.

00:09:43.92,00:09:48.19
I know. Mr. Garrison said homosexuals[br]are evil. But Sparky isn't.

00:09:48.36,00:09:51.06
Maybe he's wrong.[br]Ask somebody else.

00:09:51.23,00:09:52.49
Like who?

00:09:52.66,00:09:56.23
Now back to Jesus and Pals[br]on South Park public access.

00:09:56.53,00:10:02.67
Yea. Many of you are seeking answers[br]and I am the way for you, my children.

00:10:02.84,00:10:06.94
Let's open the phone lines up.[br]Hello, you're on the air.

00:10:07.11,00:10:09.48
- Is this Jesus?[br]- Yes, my son.

00:10:09.65,00:10:14.81
This is Robert from Torrey Pines.[br]I asked for advice on my ex-wife.

00:10:14.99,00:10:18.75
- Of course. How are things now?[br]- Everything's better.

00:10:18.92,00:10:22.48
She hasn't mouthed off since.[br]Thank you for the advice.

00:10:22.66,00:10:25.72
And for dying for my sins.[br]That was nice of you.

00:10:25.90,00:10:29.09
Blessed art thou.[br]Next caller, you're on the air.

00:10:29.27,00:10:34.60
Hi, Jesus, I have a dog[br]and he's a homosexual.

00:10:34.77,00:10:39.04
My son, many have wondered[br]what my stance on homosexuality is.

00:10:39.21,00:10:43.27
I'd like to state, once and for all,[br]my true opinion. You see...

00:10:43.45,00:10:47.78
That's all for Jesus and Pals.[br]Stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.

00:10:47.99,00:10:49.25
- Damn it![br]- What?

00:10:49.42,00:10:51.58
I got cut off[br]for Marty's Movie Reviews!

00:10:51.76,00:10:54.16
Marty's Movie Reviews are on?[br]Kick ass!

00:10:54.33,00:10:57.62
Can't anybody help me?[br]Doesn't anybody care?

00:10:57.80,00:10:59.32
We have to go practice.

00:10:59.50,00:11:01.99
It's not okay.[br]I don't want a gay dog.

00:11:02.17,00:11:06.26
I want a butch dog.[br]I want a Rin Tin Tin.

00:11:20.59,00:11:24.08
Now, children, we've got to handle[br]the ball better.

00:11:24.26,00:11:27.55
Hold the football like[br]you'd hold your lover.

00:11:27.73,00:11:31.16
Gently, yet firmly.

00:11:31.33,00:11:36.32
You want to be both nurturing[br]and clinging at the same time.

00:11:36.50,00:11:42.44
Oh, yeah. Just like making[br]sweet love to the football.

00:11:42.64,00:11:46.67
Being naughty with the football.

00:11:46.84,00:11:49.71
- Chef?[br]- Ever so gently.

00:11:49.88,00:11:51.37
- Chef?[br]- Spank it.

00:11:51.55,00:11:52.81
Chef!

00:11:52.98,00:11:55.75
Sorry, children.[br]Let's run some plays.

00:11:55.92,00:11:59.69
- Mr. Chef?[br]- We still don't have a helmet for you.

00:11:59.86,00:12:03.82
How about I use a helmet today[br]and someone else doesn't?

00:12:04.00,00:12:06.90
Would that be fair[br]to the other children?

00:12:07.07,00:12:08.40
I guess not.

00:12:09.40,00:12:11.96
We want to put a trigger[br]on that bomb...

00:12:12.14,00:12:15.57
...that makes it go off[br]at a specific moment.

00:12:15.74,00:12:17.23
What moment is that?

00:12:17.41,00:12:21.87
John Stamos' older brother is singing[br]"Loving You" during halftime.

00:12:22.05,00:12:24.91
We want it to go off[br]when he hits the high F.

00:12:25.08,00:12:27.02
- What high F?[br]- You know.

00:12:35.93,00:12:38.42
Put the trigger[br]on the "doot-en-doo"?

00:12:38.60,00:12:41.62
No, damn it. The:

00:12:45.20,00:12:46.80
Go ahead.

00:12:48.01,00:12:49.77
You got it.

00:12:52.21,00:12:53.87
All right. Yeah, okay.

00:12:54.05,00:12:56.24
What's wrong, Stan?[br]You seem down.

00:12:56.41,00:12:59.11
I can't concentrate[br]because my dog is gay.

00:12:59.28,00:13:03.55
You know what they say. You can't[br]teach a gay dog straight tricks.

00:13:03.72,00:13:06.78
Stop filling him with[br]queer-Ioving propaganda.

00:13:06.96,00:13:09.76
You of all people[br]should be sympathetic.

00:13:09.93,00:13:11.99
- What?[br]- You're gay, aren't you?

00:13:12.16,00:13:15.96
What the hell are you talking about?[br]I am not gay!

00:13:16.13,00:13:21.90
- Well, you sure do act like it.[br]- I do that to get chicks, dumb-ass.

00:13:22.61,00:13:25.08
- What's wrong?[br]- I can't find Sparky.

00:13:25.24,00:13:27.04
He usually follows me.

00:13:27.21,00:13:30.34
Maybe he went shopping[br]for some leather pants.

00:13:44.36,00:13:48.46
Hello there, little pup![br]I'm Big Gay Al.

00:13:48.63,00:13:51.19
Have you been outcast?

00:13:51.37,00:13:54.46
I'm glad you found[br]my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.

00:13:54.64,00:13:59.10
We're all big gay friends here.[br]Would you like to live with us?

00:13:59.28,00:14:04.01
Come on in, little fellow.[br]Nobody will ever oppress you here.

00:14:05.52,00:14:07.85
Have you seen Sparky?[br]He's not back.

00:14:08.02,00:14:10.75
- It's been two days.[br]- I think he ran away.

00:14:10.92,00:14:14.72
- Did you check the shopping...?[br]- We'll look after the game.

00:14:14.89,00:14:16.72
- I'm not playing.[br]- You what?

00:14:16.89,00:14:19.89
I'm not playing.[br]I have to find my dog.

00:14:20.06,00:14:23.19
Come on, Ned. And keep quiet.

00:14:25.04,00:14:28.30
- Hello there, Enrique.[br]- What are we doing here?

00:14:28.47,00:14:31.60
Well, we always kidnap[br]Middle Park's mascot.

00:14:31.78,00:14:34.47
But this year we're gonna[br]booby-trap it.

00:14:34.65,00:14:39.05
And when John Stamos' older brother[br]hits that high F, boom!

00:14:39.22,00:14:42.12
No more Middle Park players.

00:14:43.02,00:14:45.05
Goddamn, I love football!

00:14:46.09,00:14:49.99
Sparky, where are you?[br]Where could he be?

00:14:56.57,00:15:00.44
Hello, this is Frank Hammond,[br]South Park Radio, AM 900.

00:15:00.61,00:15:04.70
Tonight is the Middle Park Cowboys[br]against the South Park Cows.

00:15:04.88,00:15:07.74
Chef, the South Park Cows' coach,[br]is nervous.

00:15:07.91,00:15:10.90
It's because his quarterback[br]hasn't shown up.

00:15:11.08,00:15:13.24
Oh, come on, Stan.

00:15:13.42,00:15:16.44
If Stan doesn't show up,[br]can I use his helmet?

00:15:16.62,00:15:17.95
No, Pip.

00:15:18.12,00:15:21.58
Sparky! Sparky!

00:15:22.63,00:15:25.12
- Play ball![br]- You're quarterback, Kyle.

00:15:25.30,00:15:28.29
- I never practiced.[br]- It's late for that bullcrap.

00:15:28.47,00:15:32.56
Filling in for quarterback[br]is number 1 2, Kyle Broflovski.

00:15:32.74,00:15:34.71
Hey, where's little Stanley?

00:15:34.87,00:15:38.00
Why is that Jewish kid[br]playing quarterback?

00:15:39.14,00:15:43.77
Ned, look! They've got[br]Enrique on their sidelines.

00:15:43.95,00:15:46.88
- Looks like that bomb's still attached.[br]- Yay.

00:15:52.49,00:15:54.96
Hi, little fella, how are you doing?

00:15:55.13,00:15:58.22
- Fine, how are you?[br]- Super, thanks for asking.

00:15:58.40,00:16:01.13
My gay dog ran away.[br]Did he come here?

00:16:01.30,00:16:05.96
- Well, let's see. Come on in.[br]- Do you have lots of gay dogs here?

00:16:06.14,00:16:11.70
We have all sorts of gay animals here.[br]Over here we have a gay lion.

00:16:11.88,00:16:16.34
We have gay water buffalo.[br]Here's a gaggle of gay gooses.

00:16:16.51,00:16:19.45
Hi, fellas. It's so super to see you!

00:16:19.62,00:16:22.02
Wow, the animals are really happy.

00:16:22.19,00:16:27.06
Of course, silly buns! It's the one[br]place where they can be themselves.

00:16:27.23,00:16:29.39
Do you like to dance?

00:16:32.16,00:16:36.26
Hike me the ball, somebody run[br]and I'll throw. Ready? Break!

00:16:36.43,00:16:39.67
- You're toast.[br]- We're gonna pound your heads in.

00:16:39.84,00:16:42.17
We'll just see about that!

00:16:42.34,00:16:44.40
Set, set...

00:16:44.58,00:16:47.70
- Damn it, Cartman![br]- What's the matter?

00:16:47.88,00:16:50.75
- Cartman farted![br]- That was just my shoes.

00:16:50.92,00:16:53.71
Come on![br]We'll get a delay of game penalty.

00:16:53.89,00:16:56.25
- No way, dude![br]- Hike the ball!

00:16:56.72,00:16:59.32
- Dude, weak.[br]- You get back there.

00:17:00.09,00:17:03.03
The ball is snapped.[br]Middle Park blitzes!

00:17:03.19,00:17:07.19
Fumble! Middle Park gets the ball,[br]they run for a touchdown!

00:17:07.37,00:17:12.17
The score's 7-0 Middle Park,[br]with 1 4:57 remaining in the first.

00:17:12.34,00:17:13.74
Hell's bells.

00:17:13.91,00:17:16.37
Haven't seen a beating[br]like that since Rodney King!

00:17:16.54,00:17:19.14
That's not PC.[br]You'll get us in trouble.

00:17:19.31,00:17:21.18
Right, I gotta watch that.

00:17:21.35,00:17:25.41
If we lose money because of your[br]nephew, we'll hang you out to dry.

00:17:25.58,00:17:28.71
Don't y'all worry,[br]you just wait till halftime.

00:17:30.02,00:17:33.89
Sparky![br]Hi, Sparky, how's it going?

00:17:34.06,00:17:37.32
I miss you, old pal.[br]You really had me scared.

00:17:37.50,00:17:40.09
Let's go home.[br]I can still make the game.

00:17:40.26,00:17:44.93
We can work on making you[br]not gay together. Sparky?

00:17:45.10,00:17:49.33
- It appears you still don't understand.[br]- What don't I understand?

00:17:49.51,00:17:51.74
I have to show you something.

00:17:51.91,00:17:54.24
With a minute left in the half...

00:17:54.41,00:17:58.85
...the score is Middle Park Cowboys,[br]52. South Park Cows, 0.

00:18:00.35,00:18:04.58
I haven't seen an Englishman take[br]a blow like that since Hugh Grant!

00:18:04.76,00:18:08.32
- Dude! Now, that is not cool.[br]- Sorry, sorry.

00:18:08.49,00:18:11.69
Okay, Stan, get in line[br]for my Big Gay Boat Ride.

00:18:12.50,00:18:15.26
Step aboard, Stanley.

00:18:16.80,00:18:19.60
Welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride!

00:18:19.77,00:18:23.76
On this adventure, we'll see[br]the gay world throughout time.

00:18:23.98,00:18:27.57
The Cows are set to receive.[br]There's the kick.

00:18:27.75,00:18:30.01
It's taken by 23,[br]Kenny McCormick.

00:18:30.18,00:18:32.84
He's at the 50, the 40, the 30...

00:18:33.02,00:18:34.31
- Hold him![br]- Hold him!

00:18:34.49,00:18:38.44
The little running back is down![br]I think he's...

00:18:38.62,00:18:40.56
Yes, he's been decapitated!

00:18:41.26,00:18:45.70
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]You bastards!

00:18:45.86,00:18:48.33
- That's gotta hurt, Frank![br]- Oucheroo!

00:18:48.50,00:18:51.16
Hey, come on! That was roughing!

00:18:51.34,00:18:54.10
At least let us scrape him[br]off the field!

00:18:54.27,00:18:59.27
Looks like the Cows won't beat the[br]72 point spread, not by a long shot.

00:18:59.44,00:19:03.07
Gayness has existed since[br]the beginning of time.

00:19:03.25,00:19:07.18
From the Egyptian pharaohs[br]to the shoguns of Japan.

00:19:07.35,00:19:10.29
Uh-oh, look out, it's the oppressors!

00:19:10.45,00:19:14.08
Christians and Republicans[br]and Nazis, oh, my!

00:19:14.26,00:19:16.49
Oh, gosh, that was close.

00:19:16.66,00:19:22.26
Let's steer our boat out of here and[br]into a place where gays live freely.

00:19:33.68,00:19:36.44
- What do you think, Stan?[br]- This kicks ass.

00:19:36.61,00:19:40.02
I'm sorry I tried to change you.[br]I didn't understand.

00:19:40.18,00:19:41.62
Isn't this precious?

00:19:41.79,00:19:48.06
Now here to sing "Loving You" is[br]the one and only John Stamos' brother!

00:19:48.23,00:19:50.22
All right, Richard!

00:20:04.98,00:20:07.54
What the hell?[br]He didn't sing the high F.

00:20:07.71,00:20:11.31
Richard can't sing a high F,[br]he always screws it up.

00:20:11.48,00:20:15.28
Ned, we are gonna get[br]our asses kicked!

00:20:15.49,00:20:18.79
It's obvious where the talent[br]in that family went!

00:20:19.89,00:20:22.19
Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al.

00:20:22.36,00:20:26.46
No problem. Are you sure[br]you don't want cheese sandwiches?

00:20:26.63,00:20:29.93
I gotta get to the football game.[br]Come on, boy.

00:20:30.10,00:20:35.44
Oh, Stan. When you get back to town,[br]tell them about us, will you?

00:20:35.61,00:20:39.94
Tell them there are gay animals here[br]who need homes desperately.

00:20:40.11,00:20:42.91
I will, Big Gay Al, I will.

00:20:44.12,00:20:46.02
Oh, my carrot cake!

00:20:46.68,00:20:49.68
The Cows are being molested[br]by Middle Park!

00:20:49.85,00:20:52.35
I haven't seen so many children[br]molested since...

00:20:52.52,00:20:55.75
You said beating the spread[br]was a sure thing!

00:20:55.93,00:20:58.72
We all put our life savings[br]in this game!

00:20:58.90,00:21:00.59
You're a dead man, Jimbo!

00:21:00.77,00:21:04.53
This should just about wrap it up...[br]Wait, what's this?

00:21:06.34,00:21:08.67
It's Stan, the star quarterback.

00:21:08.84,00:21:10.74
Where the hell have you been?

00:21:10.91,00:21:14.07
- Getting my best friend back.[br]- Get in there, boy.

00:21:14.25,00:21:16.84
Give them hell, Stanley!

00:21:17.01,00:21:21.38
Jesus, I haven't asked for much.[br]All we need is one little score.

00:21:21.55,00:21:24.61
- Please. Please, Jesus![br]- Leave me alone.

00:21:25.49,00:21:27.46
Stan steps back to pass...

00:21:27.63,00:21:29.99
Hey, Stan. I'm open, I think.

00:21:30.16,00:21:33.79
And he throws it to Kyle,[br]the little Jewish kid.

00:21:33.96,00:21:38.49
Oh, my! I haven't seen a Jew run[br]like that since Poland, 1 938!

00:21:38.67,00:21:40.33
Dude!

00:21:41.31,00:21:43.77
Touchdown!

00:21:43.94,00:21:49.31
The final score is Middle Park[br]Cowboys, 73. South Park Cows, 6.

00:21:49.48,00:21:51.95
South Park beats the spread!

00:21:54.85,00:21:55.98
Speech!

00:21:56.15,00:22:01.18
What do you want to tell the world[br]about this stunning almost-victory?

00:22:01.36,00:22:04.23
It's really cool that[br]we beat the spread.

00:22:04.40,00:22:05.49
Yeah, all right!

00:22:05.66,00:22:09.66
And maybe we can beat them[br]even more next year.

00:22:09.83,00:22:14.13
- And it's okay to be gay.[br]- What?

00:22:14.31,00:22:17.40
Being gay is part of nature[br]and a beautiful thing.

00:22:17.58,00:22:19.37
What is he talking about?

00:22:19.54,00:22:23.41
Stanley, you arrived late.[br]Where were you that whole time?

00:22:23.58,00:22:25.71
With my new friend, Big Gay Al.

00:22:25.88,00:22:29.55
He showed me his sanctuary[br]and took me on a boat ride...

00:22:29.72,00:22:33.09
...where I learned all about[br]the wonders of gaiety.

00:22:33.26,00:22:35.02
It's true, I'll show you.

00:22:37.90,00:22:41.99
But it was here, right here.[br]There was a techno dance club.

00:22:42.17,00:22:46.69
You need to lay off the cough syrup.[br]Seriously. I'm worried about you.

00:22:46.87,00:22:51.14
Oliver! I thought you ran away[br]all those months ago.

00:22:51.31,00:22:53.04
- Sidney![br]- Willie!

00:22:53.21,00:22:54.44
Carlos!

00:22:54.61,00:22:57.58
Thank you so much[br]for bringing everybody here.

00:22:57.75,00:23:02.24
- There you are. How's it going?[br]- I'm super, thanks for asking.

00:23:02.42,00:23:05.65
It looks like now[br]my work here is done.

00:23:06.59,00:23:09.89
Goodbye, Stanley! Peace be with you.

00:23:13.40,00:23:15.99
- You guys, I can do it.[br]- Do what?

00:23:21.74,00:23:23.00
No!
