- Howdy ho, all you South Parketeers.[br]- Howdy ho.

00:00:08.18,00:00:11.58
- I'm rootin'-tootin' Trey Parker.[br]- And I'm Matt Stone.

00:00:11.78,00:00:14.58
- And this here's old Scratch.[br]- Hi, Scratch.

00:00:14.79,00:00:19.16
Trey and I are right excited because[br]this is our favorite episode.

00:00:19.36,00:00:23.52
It's called "Pink Eye."[br]It aired as our Halloween special.

00:00:23.70,00:00:28.10
It's all about an epidemic[br]and the boys having to save the day.

00:00:28.30,00:00:32.70
We wanted to do an episode on disease.[br]Pinkeye was the right one.

00:00:32.87,00:00:36.40
Pinkeye is a real disease[br]and anybody can get it.

00:00:36.61,00:00:39.74
So kids, be careful who you bed with.

00:00:39.95,00:00:44.91
To fight this disease, all proceeds from[br]this video go to pinkeye research.

00:00:45.08,00:00:47.38
- Yeah, right.[br]- As if we'd do that.

00:00:47.55,00:00:51.55
- Like we're gonna give away money.[br]- Look, it's Indian Companion.

00:00:51.76,00:00:53.55
Hello, Indian Companion.

00:00:53.76,00:00:55.99
Someone coming.

00:00:59.06,00:01:00.59
Thanks.

00:01:03.47,00:01:08.34
Anyway, all of y'all sit back,[br]relax and enjoy "Pink Eye."

00:01:08.54,00:01:10.27
Hooray!

00:01:43.08,00:01:45.10
Pink Eye

00:02:14.94,00:02:18.10
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny![br]- You bastards!

00:02:18.31,00:02:21.18
- What the hell is that thing?[br]- A UFO.

00:02:21.35,00:02:23.61
There's no such thing as UFOs.

00:02:25.52,00:02:27.51
Let's get him to the morgue.

00:02:32.96,00:02:36.59
Wait till you see my Halloween[br]costume. It kicks ass.

00:02:36.76,00:02:41.96
- Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.[br]- We ought to get our costumes ready.

00:02:50.58,00:02:54.20
I think death is least funny[br]when it happens to a child.

00:02:54.38,00:02:57.21
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:02:58.75,00:03:03.41
- Marty, you put that on everything.[br]- It makes everything taste so English.

00:03:03.62,00:03:06.09
Well, let's let him drain.

00:03:22.17,00:03:26.17
So then the necrophiliac says,[br]"If this ain't a cadaver..."

00:03:29.11,00:03:31.88
- Goddamn, that little turd bit me.[br]- Me too.

00:03:41.79,00:03:44.28
- You look like a pansy.[br]- Shut up, Kyle.

00:03:44.46,00:03:47.26
- What are you supposed to be?[br]- Raggedy Andy.

00:03:47.47,00:03:51.27
- Why did you dress like Raggedy Andy?[br]- Wendy's Raggedy Ann.

00:03:51.47,00:03:57.67
- This way we'll win the contest.[br]- I'll win with this Chewbacca costume.

00:03:57.84,00:04:01.30
- First prize is two tons of candy.[br]- Wow, cool.

00:04:01.51,00:04:04.41
- Hey, dudes.[br]- What kind of costume is that?

00:04:04.62,00:04:08.42
It's a Adolf Hitler costume.[br]Sieg Heil. Sieg Heil.

00:04:08.59,00:04:11.18
- Where'd you get it?[br]- My mom. It's cool.

00:04:11.36,00:04:14.88
- No, it's not cool![br]- Are you supposed to be Howdy Doody?

00:04:15.06,00:04:21.23
- No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass.[br]- Oh, wow, you look pretty cool.

00:04:21.40,00:04:23.30
- Sissy.[br]- I'll kick your ass.

00:04:23.50,00:04:29.07
- Look out, Holly Hobbie's pissed off.[br]- Hey, look, Kenny's not dead.

00:04:29.24,00:04:33.18
- You forgot to wear a costume.[br]- Couldn't your family afford one?

00:04:33.35,00:04:37.30
- Why is your family so poor?[br]- Kenny's family is so poor...

00:04:37.48,00:04:41.25
...they had to put their cardboard[br]box up for mortgage.

00:04:45.66,00:04:51.36
I said your family had to put[br]a cardboard box up for mortgage, Kenny.

00:04:51.53,00:04:54.12
I'm talking to you, Kenny![br]Achtung!

00:04:54.30,00:04:55.70
Poor piece of crap.

00:04:57.34,00:05:01.27
- Come on, we're running late![br]- We always run late, you skank.

00:05:01.44,00:05:05.03
- What did you say?[br]- I can't wait to own a fishing tank.

00:05:05.68,00:05:07.14
Neither can I.

00:05:09.48,00:05:12.38
- Very interesting.[br]- What is it, doc?

00:05:12.55,00:05:17.15
Your temperature is 55 degrees.[br]You have no pulse, no heartbeat.

00:05:17.36,00:05:21.66
- And your eyes are puffy and sticky.[br]- Oh, no, you mean...

00:05:21.83,00:05:25.23
Yeah, I'm afraid the two[br]of you have pinkeye.

00:05:25.40,00:05:28.06
I'd give you topical medicine,[br]but I don't want to touch you.

00:05:28.23,00:05:32.50
I'm so hungry and all I can[br]think about eating is brains.

00:05:32.67,00:05:36.66
Don't touch your eyes.[br]I'll prescribe some antibiotics.

00:05:38.54,00:05:43.50
Wait till everyone sees my Chewbacca[br]costume. They're gonna be so jealous.

00:05:45.05,00:05:46.98
Everyone came as Chewbacca?

00:05:47.15,00:05:50.78
It sure does seem to be[br]a popular costume this year.

00:05:52.92,00:05:54.48
- Damn it![br]- Wendy.

00:05:54.69,00:05:58.42
- Hi, Stan.[br]- We were gonna be Raggedy Ann and Andy.

00:05:58.60,00:06:01.53
- Yeah.[br]- We were gonna enter the contest.

00:06:01.70,00:06:06.33
I know, but then I guess I just[br]realized how stupid we would look.

00:06:06.50,00:06:09.70
- You what?[br]- I thought you'd agree...

00:06:09.91,00:06:12.78
...so I came as Chewbacca.

00:06:13.81,00:06:19.15
- Stan, you look pretty enough to kiss.[br]- Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend?

00:06:19.32,00:06:23.31
There, you see? All of a sudden[br]my costume is pretty bad-ass.

00:06:23.49,00:06:26.95
- Dressing like Hitler is not bad-ass.[br]- You're jealous.

00:06:27.13,00:06:30.53
- Go to Endor, wookiee![br]- Wookiees don't live on Endor!

00:06:32.23,00:06:34.99
My mom's not on the[br]cover of Crack Whore magazine.

00:06:35.17,00:06:39.10
- What did you say?[br]- Okay, Chewbaccas take your seats.

00:06:39.70,00:06:41.70
Since today is Halloween...

00:06:41.91,00:06:45.71
...we should learn about[br]the horror writer Jackie Collins.

00:06:45.88,00:06:49.28
You see, when Jackie Collins[br]first wrote her novel...

00:06:50.35,00:06:52.58
Is there a problem, Kenny?

00:06:52.75,00:06:55.55
Let's keep our hands[br]to ourselves, okay?

00:06:56.96,00:06:59.52
I'm never gonna win that candy.

00:07:08.77,00:07:14.00
- Hello there. Happy Halloween.[br]- Must eat brains.

00:07:14.77,00:07:16.64
Brains.

00:07:18.71,00:07:22.11
Oh, God! No! Stop!

00:07:22.68,00:07:26.01
I'm gonna make a new costume.[br]I can still win.

00:07:26.18,00:07:28.74
Kenny, are you gonna[br]eat your pudding?

00:07:28.92,00:07:32.95
No, Eric, go ahead and take[br]my pudding if you'd like.

00:07:33.12,00:07:35.75
Why, thank you, Kenny.[br]How nice of you.

00:07:35.93,00:07:37.90
Aren't you hungry, Kenny?

00:07:38.06,00:07:41.23
- He hasn't moved or said anything.[br]- Hello, children.

00:07:41.40,00:07:42.96
Hey, Chef.

00:07:44.47,00:07:48.43
- What're you doing dressed like that?[br]- Eating Kenny's pudding.

00:07:48.61,00:07:51.60
Hello there.[br]Love the Elvis costume, Chef.

00:07:51.81,00:07:56.04
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel.[br]Why the hell would I dress like Elvis?

00:07:56.21,00:08:00.55
Why the hell would you dress like[br]Evel Knievel? I hope you are...

00:08:01.82,00:08:04.52
Eric, what do you think you're doing?

00:08:04.69,00:08:08.02
He said I could have[br]his pudding. Ask him yourself.

00:08:08.19,00:08:13.72
That's right, Principal Victoria.[br]It's okay with me because Eric is cool.

00:08:13.90,00:08:19.77
- Where did you get that costume?[br]- My mom made it. Sieg Heil. Sieg Heil.

00:08:19.97,00:08:24.53
God bless America. You get into my[br]office before anyone else sees you.

00:08:24.71,00:08:27.44
I have to show you[br]an educational video.

00:08:27.61,00:08:30.41
I don't want to see[br]an educational video.

00:08:33.39,00:08:35.98
- You bit my arm![br]- Kenny's back to normal.

00:08:36.15,00:08:40.35
- Watch the video, Eric.[br]- Adolf Hitler was a very naughty man.

00:09:02.95,00:09:06.58
So remember, kids, dressing up[br]like Hitler isn't cool.

00:09:06.75,00:09:11.09
- Do you have any questions?[br]- Can I see that again, that was cool.

00:09:11.26,00:09:16.52
- You must remove that costume.[br]- I can't. I have to win the candy.

00:09:16.69,00:09:20.60
Well, how about we make you[br]a new costume? Let's see now...

00:09:21.50,00:09:24.99
How about we make you[br]a nice, scary ghost costume?

00:09:25.17,00:09:29.16
- I don't want to be a stupid ghost.[br]- And let me just make...

00:09:29.34,00:09:34.90
...a few quickie alterations.[br]And there you go, young man.

00:09:38.78,00:09:43.31
Looks like they got a touch of that[br]pinkeye that's going around.

00:09:47.93,00:09:51.99
- Boo, I'm a ghost.[br]- Oh, man, I feel like a total choad.

00:09:52.20,00:09:55.43
That's just because[br]you look like a total choad.

00:09:55.63,00:09:59.47
- Hello, children.[br]- Hey, Chef.

00:10:00.11,00:10:03.63
- Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?[br]- Where's Kyle?

00:10:03.94,00:10:06.47
- Check this out.[br]- Whoa, dude.

00:10:06.64,00:10:08.91
- What is that?[br]- I'm the solar system.

00:10:09.08,00:10:12.71
The planets revolve the right way.[br]That candy is mine.

00:10:13.15,00:10:15.68
Okay, let's get lined up[br]so the judge...

00:10:15.85,00:10:18.65
...can get a look[br]at your stupid costumes.

00:10:18.82,00:10:25.09
We have a celebrity judge, the star[br]of Family Ties, Miss Tina Yothers.

00:10:25.26,00:10:27.75
- Who?[br]- Dude, I thought she was dead.

00:10:27.93,00:10:30.53
Thank you, Miss Yothers.[br]Okay...

00:10:30.70,00:10:34.60
The second-place award[br]for best costume goes to...

00:10:35.01,00:10:38.87
...Kenny for his Edward[br]James Olmos costume.

00:10:40.35,00:10:43.78
And the award for the[br]very best costume goes to...

00:10:44.88,00:10:47.85
Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume.

00:10:48.85,00:10:54.09
What? But she looks just like everybody[br]else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!

00:10:54.26,00:10:57.19
The award for worst costume[br]this year goes to...

00:10:57.40,00:11:00.66
...Stan, for his stupid[br]little clown-thing costume.

00:11:00.87,00:11:04.06
Let's all point at Stan[br]and laugh, children.

00:11:04.54,00:11:07.00
Thanks a lot, you ruined[br]my Halloween.

00:11:07.17,00:11:10.84
Relax, you'll feel better once[br]we're trick-or-treating.

00:11:11.01,00:11:13.41
I don't wanna trick-or-treat[br]with you.

00:11:13.58,00:11:16.88
Let's all gather around[br]and bob for stupid apples.

00:11:17.22,00:11:19.41
You go first, Bebe.

00:11:19.58,00:11:22.78
Use those mouth muscles[br]like the girls in Beijing.

00:11:22.95,00:11:24.39
Brains.

00:11:26.09,00:11:27.65
Wait your turn, Clyde.

00:11:32.60,00:11:35.40
Johnson, what the hell's[br]gotten into you?

00:11:35.77,00:11:38.13
Pinkeye.

00:11:38.30,00:11:43.33
Get the hell out of here, Johnson.[br]I don't want no goddamn pinkeye.

00:11:43.81,00:11:46.74
And the president responded[br]by saying, quote:

00:11:46.91,00:11:50.68
"Screw the commie bastards,[br]and screw their space station. "

00:11:50.85,00:11:55.15
In other news, a pinkeye epidemic[br]is sweeping South Park.

00:11:55.32,00:11:57.62
With a report,[br]a midget in a bikini.

00:11:57.79,00:12:00.78
Thanks, Tom. More than[br]half the townspeople...

00:12:00.96,00:12:03.36
...have been infected[br]with the virus.

00:12:06.36,00:12:09.80
Symptoms include a complete[br]loss of heart functions...

00:12:09.97,00:12:13.27
...lung activity and, of course,[br]sticky, puffy eyes.

00:12:13.44,00:12:16.84
Pinkeye, my ass.[br]I've seen this before.

00:12:19.04,00:12:21.91
Where is Kyle?[br]We don't have all night.

00:12:22.08,00:12:26.41
- I bet I get more candy than you.[br]- You crazy? I'm the candy master.

00:12:26.58,00:12:29.42
You're the ass master.[br]There's a difference.

00:12:29.59,00:12:32.99
I'm not the one who looks[br]like Pippi Longstocking!

00:12:33.16,00:12:36.49
My mom's not on the cover[br]of Crack Whore magazine.

00:12:36.66,00:12:40.10
My mom is not on the cover[br]of Crack Whore magazine!

00:12:40.27,00:12:43.23
- Hey, dudes.[br]- Make sure we've got everything.

00:12:43.40,00:12:44.73
- Flashlight?[br]- Check.

00:12:44.90,00:12:46.23
- Pumpkin pails?[br]- Check.

00:12:46.40,00:12:47.74
- Taser.[br]- What's that?

00:12:47.91,00:12:50.31
For shocking people[br]who give granola.

00:12:50.48,00:12:52.34
Yeah, granola pisses me off.

00:12:52.78,00:12:53.97
Hey, Kenny.

00:12:55.71,00:12:58.98
- You stink![br]- You still didn't get a costume, Kenny?

00:13:00.32,00:13:03.08
Too bad drinking scotch[br]isn't a paying job...

00:13:03.25,00:13:05.98
...or Kenny's dad[br]would be a millionaire.

00:13:06.16,00:13:09.65
I said your dad would be[br]a millionaire. Get it? Kenny!

00:13:09.83,00:13:13.85
Your family is poor, Kenny.[br]Your family is poor!

00:13:14.03,00:13:17.49
I don't like Kenny anymore.[br]He doesn't communicate.

00:13:18.77,00:13:20.47
- Hi, guys.[br]- Hi, Wendy.

00:13:20.64,00:13:24.94
- How's your barrel full of candy?[br]- I didn't want that sweet stuff.

00:13:25.11,00:13:28.04
I gave it away to hungry[br]children in Nairobi.

00:13:28.21,00:13:32.21
- You what? Are you insane?[br]- Let's go trick-or-treat.

00:13:32.38,00:13:35.28
I don't think so.[br]You've had enough candy.

00:13:35.45,00:13:40.76
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed[br]up like Raggedy Andy. Don't be mad.

00:13:40.93,00:13:43.66
How could he be mad[br]with such pretty hair?

00:13:43.83,00:13:46.59
- Trick-or-treat with yourself.[br]- But, Stan...

00:13:46.76,00:13:50.20
No buts, Wendy.[br]I wish you were dead!

00:13:54.77,00:13:56.80
- Doctor.[br]- Why, hello, Chef.

00:13:56.97,00:14:02.11
- Let me guess, pinkeye, right?[br]- No, doctor. I've seen this before.

00:14:02.28,00:14:06.51
- It's the living dead.[br]- What the hell are you talking about?

00:14:06.68,00:14:09.35
Dead people getting up[br]and walking around...

00:14:09.52,00:14:13.15
...and Tina Yothers in town...[br]Coincidence? I don't think so!

00:14:13.32,00:14:16.45
The pinkeye has[br]made you a little delirious.

00:14:16.63,00:14:20.36
- Let me give you some topical cream.[br]- Damn it, don't you see?

00:14:20.53,00:14:26.33
These people have been zombiefied.[br]They got no feeling. I'll show you.

00:14:27.11,00:14:31.27
Mr. Torres was here[br]for a routine checkup, Chef.

00:14:31.44,00:14:36.78
Sorry, but my point is, topical cream[br]ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.

00:14:36.95,00:14:42.55
There have been a lot of advances[br]in topical creams the last few years.

00:14:42.72,00:14:45.55
Who was the first one[br]to come in here sick?

00:14:45.72,00:14:50.52
Well, it was the mortician[br]and his assistant at the morgue.

00:14:54.53,00:14:59.99
Now, let's form a line. I've got[br]enough topical cream for everybody.

00:15:01.07,00:15:03.20
Trick or treat.

00:15:03.88,00:15:06.37
Oh, how cute.

00:15:09.25,00:15:12.88
- Dude, Kenny.[br]- Oh, my God, call 91 1!

00:15:13.08,00:15:17.11
- Call 91 1![br]- Kenny, she was going to give us candy.

00:15:17.29,00:15:20.95
- She had Sweetie Pops.[br]- You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole.

00:15:22.93,00:15:28.30
- Mayor, we've got a big problem.[br]- Why, Chef, what a surprise.

00:15:28.77,00:15:33.67
You're wondering why we're here[br]with a pile of money and no pants on.

00:15:33.84,00:15:36.31
- Actually...[br]- Well, I can assure you...

00:15:36.47,00:15:39.91
...it has nothing to do[br]with the Japanese mafia.

00:15:40.08,00:15:43.01
- Not a thingy-dingy.[br]- I don't give a crap.

00:15:43.18,00:15:48.68
- Do something about the living dead.[br]- You mean Tina Yothers?

00:15:50.46,00:15:54.22
No! The zombies that have[br]taken over South Park.

00:15:54.39,00:15:59.85
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump[br]over them with your rocket cycle?

00:16:01.33,00:16:03.93
To hell with you both.

00:16:04.34,00:16:06.80
- Well, let's get back to it.[br]- Right.

00:16:08.47,00:16:09.46
Trick or treat!

00:16:09.64,00:16:13.70
Hope you kids like chocolate[br]peanut butter cream puffies...

00:16:13.88,00:16:17.14
Get it off, get it off me!

00:16:22.45,00:16:25.79
We'll never get candy[br]if Kenny keeps eating people.

00:16:25.96,00:16:30.49
Yeah, that's it, Kenny. You can't[br]trick-or-treat with us anymore.

00:16:31.00,00:16:32.26
Oh, God!

00:16:34.23,00:16:35.43
Trick or treat.

00:16:36.83,00:16:40.07
Hey, they're all dressed up[br]like ghosts too.

00:16:40.87,00:16:43.50
One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards.

00:16:45.74,00:16:48.14
Oh, my God! Stop!

00:16:50.38,00:16:51.85
Trick or...

00:16:52.02,00:16:55.51
Get off my property,[br]you brain-eating zombie bastards.

00:16:55.69,00:16:57.12
- Hey, Chef.[br]- Chef, no.

00:16:57.29,00:17:00.05
Sorry, I thought you[br]were one of them.

00:17:00.22,00:17:04.85
- Can we have some candy now?[br]- What are you doing dressed like that?

00:17:05.06,00:17:08.93
- I'm trying to trick-or-treat.[br]- Remind me to whip your ass.

00:17:09.10,00:17:12.43
Now get in here before[br]those zombies get you.

00:17:12.90,00:17:15.37
- What are you talking about?[br]- Zombies.

00:17:15.54,00:17:20.77
South Park is overrun with living dead.[br]Haven't you noticed anything strange?

00:17:21.35,00:17:23.94
Kenny keeps eating people's brains.

00:17:24.12,00:17:28.64
Don't you see? Kenny's a zombie.[br]Along with everyone else in town.

00:17:28.82,00:17:31.75
- That means...[br]- Lf everyone's zombies...

00:17:31.99,00:17:35.29
Then there won't be anyone[br]to give us candy.

00:17:37.26,00:17:39.89
- You've gotta help us.[br]- I'm working on it.

00:17:41.10,00:17:44.03
- Where are we going?[br]- The first people treated...

00:17:44.20,00:17:46.53
...were the mortician[br]and his assistant.

00:17:46.77,00:17:49.97
We'll get to the bottom[br]of this at the morgue.

00:17:52.94,00:17:53.93
That was Kyle.

00:17:56.35,00:17:59.04
- I don't know about this.[br]- Yeah, I'm scared.

00:17:59.22,00:18:03.28
Remember candy, focus on the candy.

00:18:03.45,00:18:07.86
- What are we doing here, Chef?[br]- Just look for anything suspicious.

00:18:08.03,00:18:09.39
I found it.

00:18:09.59,00:18:12.06
- What?[br]- See, your mom is on the cover.

00:18:14.90,00:18:17.20
We told you, dude.

00:18:17.40,00:18:19.70
You better let me take that, Kyle.

00:18:19.87,00:18:21.96
Hey, Chef. Look.

00:18:28.01,00:18:32.54
- I gotta call this hotline number.[br]- Pinkeye.

00:18:32.72,00:18:36.41
It's the British kid.[br]He's a little limey zombie now.

00:18:36.59,00:18:39.15
Look out, children!

00:18:46.83,00:18:51.03
Okay, Chef, dial the[br]hotline number. Chef?

00:18:51.94,00:18:53.67
Chef!

00:19:13.59,00:19:15.06
Let's get out of here.

00:19:17.93,00:19:21.73
- We got to call that hotline.[br]- Hey, there's a pay phone.

00:19:21.90,00:19:25.10
- Call the number, Kyle.[br]- The zombies are coming.

00:19:25.30,00:19:27.00
We'll hold them off.

00:19:28.11,00:19:30.67
Welcome to the[br]Worcestershire hotline.

00:19:30.84,00:19:36.51
For recipes, please press one.[br]For product placement, press two.

00:19:36.81,00:19:39.75
If sauce has been[br]used in embalming, press...

00:19:40.25,00:19:44.24
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats[br]and gets away with it.

00:19:44.42,00:19:47.12
- Yeah, cool.[br]- Sweet.

00:19:51.80,00:19:56.73
This call might be monitored to ensure[br]quality service. How may I help you?

00:19:56.90,00:19:59.67
- There's zombies here.[br]- Please hold.

00:20:08.38,00:20:09.90
Wendy?

00:20:10.92,00:20:14.35
- Finish her, dude, she's a zombie now.[br]- I know, but...

00:20:14.52,00:20:17.89
Remember how she dissed[br]you at the costume contest?

00:20:18.06,00:20:19.85
Hey, yeah.

00:20:21.06,00:20:24.05
You need to make sure[br]you do not just go out...

00:20:24.23,00:20:30.13
...and start decapitating zombies left[br]and right. Do you understand?

00:20:30.30,00:20:31.89
Okay, then what?

00:20:32.60,00:20:35.07
Wendy, I know I wished[br]you were dead.

00:20:35.24,00:20:37.64
- But I didn't mean it.[br]- Kill her, Stan.

00:20:37.81,00:20:40.87
Kill the original zombie[br]that started the mess.

00:20:41.05,00:20:44.14
All the other zombies[br]will turn back to normal.

00:20:44.32,00:20:47.65
How the hell do we know[br]who the original zombie is?

00:20:47.82,00:20:50.95
You have a choice in[br]Worcestershire sauces. We...

00:20:51.49,00:20:55.95
Wait, that thing landed on Kenny[br]and they took him to the mortuary.

00:20:56.53,00:20:58.96
I can't.

00:21:06.74,00:21:10.43
Oh, my God, I killed Kenny.[br]You bastard!

00:21:11.64,00:21:14.54
What happened? Stan?

00:21:14.71,00:21:19.21
- Babe, everything's gonna be okay.[br]- They're turning back to normal.

00:21:19.38,00:21:23.32
- You did it, children.[br]- Okay, let's go trick-or-treat now.

00:21:23.49,00:21:26.72
I'm sorry I dissed you[br]at school like that, Stan.

00:21:26.89,00:21:29.95
I wasn't very considerate[br]of your feelings.

00:21:30.13,00:21:32.72
I'm sorry I wished you were dead.

00:21:32.90,00:21:37.70
Maybe we could actually[br]kiss tonight, Stan.

00:21:40.60,00:21:42.50
Gross, Stan. Sick.

00:21:43.17,00:21:44.64
Barf is gross.

00:21:49.15,00:21:53.85
- Man, I can't believe he's gone.[br]- He was too young to be taken from us.

00:21:54.02,00:21:56.32
You're the one who cut him in half.

00:21:56.49,00:22:02.29
Let us remember the good times.[br]Kenny would have wanted it that...

00:22:05.23,00:22:09.72
I learned something today. Halloween[br]isn't about costumes or candy.

00:22:09.90,00:22:12.96
It's about being good,[br]and giving and loving.

00:22:13.14,00:22:15.54
No, dude, that's Christmas.

00:22:15.71,00:22:19.70
- Then what's Halloween about?[br]- Costumes and candy.

00:22:21.15,00:22:23.17
Well, let's go eat that candy.

00:22:23.35,00:22:26.37
We can eat at Cartman's[br]and see naughty pictures of his mom.

00:22:26.55,00:22:29.75
Knock it off. She was young[br]and needed the money.

00:22:29.92,00:22:33.52
Cartman, those pictures[br]were taken, like, last month.

00:22:33.96,00:22:36.26
Screw you guys!
