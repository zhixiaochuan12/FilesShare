10
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:36,180
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny
versus you two assholes.

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,288
Fine.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,659
Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?

13
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,937
Sir, could you move a little, please?
- Spare some change?

14
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,140
Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.
Get out of here!

15
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,770
You guys, that's not cool.
These people have nowhere to go.

16
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,500
They don't have food or shelter.
We have to do something.

17
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,512
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
- Yeah, what are we supposed to do?

18
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:04,843
No, Kyle's right, you guys.
We should do something.

19
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,332
Really?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,453
I know what you're thinking, Kyle
and I'm with you.

21
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:10,991
I know exactly what we should do.

22
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:17,221
Gather around and witness the glory as
Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateborad

23
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:18,662
over the homeless.

24
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,500
Thank you, thank you.
The ramp ready?

25
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,300
Yeah, it's all set.

26
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:24,281
He won't make it.

27
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:27,401
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what
I had in mind!

28
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:29,882
All right, here we go! Jimmy?

29
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:43,050
Yes! I did it!
I jumped over the homeless!

30
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,553
Yes!
- Yes, yes!

31
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:48,571
That was a sweet idea, Kyle.
- Goddamnit, that wasn't my idea!

32
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,551
All right, people, we need to come up
with answers.

33
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:55,901
There are homeless sprouting up all over town.
What are we supposed to do?

34
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,622
Well, I short of had an idea.
- Please, Mr. Valmor.

35
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:04,543
We could give the homeless all
designer sleeping bags and makeovers.

36
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,621
At least that way they'd be pleasant
to look at.

37
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,550
Oh, that's a good one.
- Good idea. I like it.

38
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,693
Well I was thinking:

39
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,352
We could turn the homeless into tires

40
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,072
so that we'd still have homeless,
but we could use them, on our cars.

41
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:19,881
Oh, that's a good one.
- Nice one, Randy.

42
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,370
Like it.
- That's like recycling.

43
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,730
All right, enough!

44
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:26,432
I find this whole conversation
to be extremely offensive!

45
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:31,653
The homeless aren't monsters,
they are people, like you and me!

46
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:35,582
You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.

47
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,051
Excuse me.

48
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:40,592
I am the top researcher of homeless
studies for Park County.

49
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,532
I don't know why more homeless people
are showing up in town, but I do know...

50
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,861
that we must be extremely careful.

51
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,671
If we give them anything,
there could be more.

52
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,381
Spare change?

53
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,471
Hi.

54
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:11,341
I've been saving up for a new
X-Box game but...

55
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:14,573
but I think you could use the money
a lot more than I could.

56
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:18,663
Listen, I want you to take this.
It's twenty dollars.

57
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:23,221
Got any more?

58
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,823
No, that... I thought that was a lot.

59
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,573
Spare any change?

60
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,192
You're welcome.

61
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,411
Oh crap.

62
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,842
Dude, what are all these homeless
people doing in front of your house?

63
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,701
I don't know.
- There's a bunch outside my house too.

64
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:01,590
Spare any change, sir?
- No! Fuck off!

65
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:05,233
I don't get it. My dad said as long as
nobody gave them money, they'd move on.

66
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,223
He did?
- Well this is bullcrap!

67
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,773
Somebody has to be responsible!

68
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:12,181
Well, I kind of gave a homeless guy
twenty dollars last night.

69
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:13,121
You what?

70
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:16,440
Oh come on, that can't be why they're all here.
There has to be another reason.

71
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,983
Kyle, what were you thinking?

72
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:21,131
Yeah! I can't possibly jump these
many homeless people!

73
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,620
I won't risk it!

74
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:25,092
I could jump two homeless people, maybe three

75
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:28,251
but asking me to jump this many
is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!

76
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:31,002
I don't want you to jump them, retard!

77
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,923
Spare some change?
- No, sorry, I don't have any change.

78
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:41,272
Got any change?
- No, sorry.

79
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,373
Can you spare some change?

80
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,300
Change?

81
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,660
I don't have any change.

82
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,890
Change?
- No!

83
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:54,010
Change?

84
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:58,771
Spare some change?
- Leave me alone I don't have any change!

85
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:00,871
All right, God bless you, sir.

86
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:04,041
Oh, now I feel bad. Here!

87
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:07,421
Change?
- Change?

88
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,791
No, that was really all the change I had.

89
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,862
Spare some change?
- I just gave you change!

90
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:18,100
Change?

91
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,673
I don't have any more change!

92
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:32,143
No! I don't have any change!
I don't have any change!

93
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,210
Okay, that'll be great.

94
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:39,790
Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in
the community center for everyone to attend.

95
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:45,330
Stay away! Stay away!

96
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:48,561
Randy? Randy, what happened?

97
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:53,772
I don't have any change!
I don't have any change!

<i>This is a News 5 Special Bulletin,

Oh my God.

106
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:22,133
In the meantime, South Park citizens
are being advised to stay indoors

107
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,341
and protect their change.

108
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,351
Spare some change?

109
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,411
What the? You can't be in here.

110
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,862

- No, I don't have any change.

00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:38,221
No, please. I don't have any change.

114
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,273
Honest I don't. I don't have any!

What the hell were you doing outside?!

123
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,441
Our parents are stuck on top of
a building in town.

124
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:10,572
You aren't getting into town!
It's completely overrun with these things.

125
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:18,173
No! I don't need my windshield cleaned!
Stop it! Stop it!

126
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:23,212
Look, our only hope is to talk to
the homeless researcher out on Travis Street.

127
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:27,503
He understands what's going on better
than anybody. Just stick with me, kids.

128
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:38,300
Holy shit, dude!
- Over here!

129
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,391
Jump down! Go!

130
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:46,053
Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's
house down here.

131
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,933
Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!

132
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,770
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude.
We need to work together.

133
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,520
Come on, we gotta
get to that scientist's house.

134
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:07,463
No sign of anybody else.

135
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,760
That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.

136
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:13,290
Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never
get through all those homeless people.

137
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,042
And even if you did, what then?
You can't drive anywhere.

138
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:21,402
If I can make it through them, maybe I can
catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.

139
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:24,143
You won't make it through, Gerald!

140
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:32,402
Change? Change sir?
- You got some change?

141
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,600
Don't have any change.
- Change!

142
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,753
Don't have any change.

143
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,480
Damnit! All right, you want change? Here.

144
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:51,188
There! There's some change.
All right, a little bit.

145
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,079
There you go. Take the change.

146
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:57,507
Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have
any change left for the bus.

147
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,281
Hold on. Can I just get back some
of that change, please?

148
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,151
Change, sir?

149
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,763
Can I have just a little change for
the bus, please?

150
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:07,252
I need a little anybody have some change?

151
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:10,910
Change? Got any change?

152
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:19,253
What happened?
- He's become one of them.

153
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:38,613
Go away, I don't have any change.
- Are you the head of Homeless Studies?

154
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:42,132
Yes. Who are you?
- We think this may be our friend's fault.

155
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,241
He gave one of the homeless
twenty dollars yesterday-

156
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:48,613
Oh my God. Get in here!
Tell me what's going on?

157
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:51,492
There's a bunch of people trapped in the
middle of town surrounded by homeless people.

158
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:52,742
We can't get to them.

159
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,691
All right, all right, look!
I didn't wanna risk it, but...

160
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:57,390
I think I know what to do.

161
00:09:57,428 --> 00:10:00,300
I'll try to jump all those homeless
and get to the people on that roof.

162
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,743
Jump them?
- I jump the homeless professionally.

163
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:06,062
If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to
jump that homeless crowd and save those people.

164
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,860
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did
was jump over one homeless guy.

165
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,740
I easily could have cleared another
thirty or forty.

166
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,683
You barely made it over one, fatass!

167
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:16,421
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless
people isn't gonna solve anything right now!

168
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,202
God-damnit!
I don't want him to jump over more a-

169
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:23,600
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite
understand how the homeless function.

170
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:28,292
Perhaps you should come downstairs.
To my laboratory.

171
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,133
We don't have any change! Go away!

172
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,142
Anything, Steven?
- No.

173
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,790
All the phone lines are completely down.

174
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:56,330
Hello? It's Steve Garrett from the libraray.
Please let us in.

175
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:58,660
Find another place to hide, Steve!

176
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:03,223
I have others with me. We we have nowhere
else to go. One woman here is pregnant.

177
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,970
We can't just leave them out there.

178
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:10,290
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming!
No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.

179
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,093
You have to let them in, Randy.

180
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,591
There isn't enough food for more people
up here!

181
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:19,342
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.
We're gonna have to give him some change.

182
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:23,823
This isn't happening!
- All right all right, fine!

183
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:30,451
Could you spare some change, sir?

184
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:36,911
I've dissected several homeless to see
what make them tick.

185
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,733
Their anotomy is shockingly similar to ours.

186
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,912
See? Everything is there:
heart, lungs, kidneys.

187
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:46,090
They're almost identical to us in every way.

188
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,421
Except for one.

189
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:55,893
The homeless can survive solely on change.

190
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,512
Change?

191
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:01,391
They feed on our change.
They need it in order to keep them moving

192
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,181
Is that some spare change?

193
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:08,162
Somehow they're able to take our change
and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.

194
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,343
Spare some of that change, sir?
- But now watch.

195
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,360
Spare some change?

196
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:20,522
It has already completely forgotten
that I've given it change.

197
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:24,343
It just wants more, change.

198
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,121
Look over here.

199
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,102
This one I've kept deprived of change
for over three days.

200
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:32,071
Change?

201
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,322
What's it doing?
- It's dying.

202
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:35,403
Cool.

203
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:39,930
I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen
had a homeless problem just before we did.

204
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:42,213
And they were able to stop it.

205
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:46,353
Excuse me, the front door was open.
Can I borrow some change?

206
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:49,553
Change?

207
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,272
Oh my God, they're coming in!

208
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:54,142
Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!

209
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:56,093
What about you?

210
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:59,570
Get to Evergreen and find out how they
got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!

211
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,332
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.

212
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:05,042
Hello? I'm sorry, I just really
need some change for the bus?

213
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:07,390
Change?
- Spare some change?

214
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,652
Stop it! I really do need change!

215
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,851
Me too. Change?
- Change?

216
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:16,871
Hello? Do you have any change?

217
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,592
Sorry to take the easy way out.

218
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,012
Ow! Oh, fuck!

219
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,832
Ah! God!

220
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,640
No. No, damnit!

221
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:03,913
That's it. That's it, everyone.
We're out of Pop-Tarts.

222
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:07,383
No. We can't be.
- Face it, we're gonnna starve!

223
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:11,343
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
- Those are cherry!

224
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,893
Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal.

225
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,722
What? You do?
- How? Call the fire department.

226
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,812
I'm calling my wife.

227
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,221
Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?

228
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:24,052
Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
- Ask her what's happening.

229
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:27,512
Mary, what's going on out there?
Nobody's coming for us.

230
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,883
They what? No! That's impossible.

231
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,040
But how can that be? We didn't even-

232
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:36,802
Hello? Mary. Mary!

233
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,150
What happened, Glen?

234
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:41,092
There's no help coming! She said...

235
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,441
because of all the homeless...

236
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:47,072
because of all the homeless in South Park
property values have plummeted.

237
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,810
I had two liens against my house
and so the bank is foreclosing!

238
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:53,361
I don't have a home anymore.

239
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,422
Randy, what are you doing?

240
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,941
He's homeless now. We aren't safe.

241
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:03,840
I'm not like them.
- Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

242
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,513
And what are you gonna do, huh?
Just blow his head off?

243
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:08,953
If we have to! Siddown Glen!

244
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:13,183
Randy, you can't just-
- Sit down!

245
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,053
This is crazy.
How can they just take away my house?

246
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:19,611
Where am I supposed to put all my things?

247
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,550
I don't have a place for all my stuff,
where am I supposed to put all my stuff?

248
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:26,201
I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow
some money to put my stuff in storage?

249
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:28,803
Come on guys.
If you all just help me out a little bit.

250
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,742
Each one of you just put in a little change?

251
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:33,401
Change?

252
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,660
What the hell happened here?

253
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:53,322
That's far enough! Just march
your butts right back out of our town!

254
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,283
We, just came to ask a question.

255
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:58,523
You homeless or homeowners?
- We're nine.

256
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:02,101
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless,
so get out of here before you die!

257
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:04,481
Look, we just need help with our
own homeless problem.

258
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:07,011
Yeah. This Jew here made them take
over our town.

259
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,932
Shut up, Cartman!

260
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:10,231
Cartman?

261
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,850
Eric Cartman?

262
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:17,080
The kid who jumped thirty homeless people
on a skateboard?

263
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,391
You heard about that?
- Heard about it?

264
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:23,630
They said you could have easily cleared
fifty homeless with that jump.

265
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,973
Thirty was hard enough.

266
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,003
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one!

267
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:30,921
He jumped over one homeless person
with his stupid skateboard

268
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,631
and he barely made it over that guy!

269
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,923
Kyle, knock it off!

270
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:35,590
We're here to find out how to get rid
of the homeless

271
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,410
not how many homeless Cartman can jump!

272
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:41,032
Please, we just want you to tell us how
you got rid of the homeless in your town.

273
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,482
Well, that was easy.

274
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:51,620
The homeless first started arriving
in Evergreen about three months ago.

275
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:56,063
At first there were only a few of them,
asking for change, sleeping in the parks.

276
00:16:56,105 --> 00:17:00,623
But then more showed up and we realized
there was something different about them.

277
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:06,380
They fed off of our change to the point that
they could actually start renting apartments.

278
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:10,521
We knew it wouldn't be long before the
homeless actually started buying homes.

279
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:14,403
And then we'd have no idea who
was homeless and who wasn't!

280
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,033
The people living in the house right
next door to you could be homeless

281
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,102
and you wouldn't even know!

282
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,803
Nobody could trust anybody!
Fights broke out. War!

283
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,291
That's when I started suspecting
that my own wife...

284
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:30,780
who I'd been living with for twenty years,
was actually homeless.

285
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,080
So I had to burn her.
In her bed while she slept.

286
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:38,351
After she died I vowed I wouldn't let
the homeless destroy our town!

287
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:42,261
So we came up with a plan to get
rid of them once and for all.

288
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:46,183
<i>"Haven for the homeless.
Try South Park!"</i>

289
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:50,561
You son of a bitch.
You didn't solve your homeless problem.

290
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,460
You just sent all your homeless to South Park!

291
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,872
That's right, yes.

292
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:56,553
What?
- I knew it!

293
00:17:56,595 --> 00:18:00,641
It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty
dollars! The homeless all came from here!

294
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:02,933
And it was Texas who sent them to us!

295
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,220
People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless

296
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,631
by telling them what a great place
Evergreen was!

297
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,130
But then you didn't solve the problem,
you just moved it!

298
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:13,110
Right. But we survived.

299
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:17,202
Dennis!

300
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:24,443
Christine!
- You sonofabitch! You tried to kill me!

301
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:30,150
I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
- No, I wasn't homeless you stupid asshole!

302
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,373
Christine, I can't understand you.

303
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:37,560
Yeah! Because you burned my lips off!
- I nurned your rip sauce?

304
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:41,542
No! You burned my lips off!

305
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:44,141
I have no idea what you're saying!

306
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:54,142
Dude, our parents are just as stupid
as these people.

307
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:56,102
Our town is gonna end up just like this!

308
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,622
No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.

309
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,740
No no no, we're not having Cartman
jump any more homeless people, Kyle!

310
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,153
That isn't my idea!

311
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:06,810
I saw a bus in a garage a couple of
blocks back! We need to modify it!

312
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,051
What are we gonna do?

313
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,883
We're gonna save our parents
before they all kill each other!

314
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:41,920
A bus! A bus is coming!

315
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:47,331
It's the boys! They've modified
a bus to get us out of here!

316
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:48,962
I knew they'd come back for us!

317
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,403
All right!
- Yeah.

318
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:53,290
Look, Glen. We're saved.

319
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,733
All right, I'm turning around.

320
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:01,113
Why are they turning?
- What are they doing?

321
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:05,061
Don't leave us!

322
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:08,162
All right, hit it.
- Let's hope to Christ this works.
