South Park - Season 11 Episode 5
"Fantastic Easter Special"

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,907
...In my Easter Bonnet,
with all the frills upon it,

3
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:38,499
I'll be the grandest
lady in the Easter parade.

4
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:40,362
Look at that one, huh?

5
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:43,731
Half purple and half yellow
with a chikadee sticker.

6
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,931
I'm good.

7
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,485
Uh, can I ask a question?

8
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,099
Why do we do this?

9
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:53,291
Wha... what do you mean,
"Why do we do this?" It's Easter!

10
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,941
Right, so, why do we color eggs?

11
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:00,948
Wulll, ssso that the
Easter bunny can hide them.

12
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,548
Yeah, but why?

13
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:05,886
Stanley, Easter celebrates
the day that Jesus was resurrected

14
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:08,536
after being crucified for our sins.

15
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,419
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar
and a giant rabbit hides them?

16
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,342
That's right.

17
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:15,742
You don't see the missteps
in logic with that?

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,884
Look, I'm just saying that somewhere
between Jesus dying on the Cross

19
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:22,093
and a giant bunny hiding eggs there
seems to be a, a gap of information.

20
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,376
Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!

21
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:27,416
I don't feel like coloring eggs!
I don't get it!

22
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,178
What is wrong with him?!

23
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:31,312
Well, he's just getting older, Randy.

24
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:34,862
Maybe he figured out
the Easter bunny isn't real.

25
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:39,415
You know so little!

26
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:44,198
<i></i>

27
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,009
And I want a Baltor
soldier doll for Easter,

28
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,903
and five Crash'n'Go RC cars,
you got that?!

29
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:50,800
Do you HAVE that?!

30
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,990
- Ahh, don't you think that's-
- Nono! You don't ask me questions!

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,954
You are a rabbit! I am a human.

32
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,597
So if you don't bring me what I
want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!

33
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:00,797
Smile!

34
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,890
Bye, Easter bunny!

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,090
Oh My God.

36
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:07,766
All right,
can you explain to me what's going on?

37
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:08,578
Huh?

38
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,150
What is the deal with the coloring the
eggs and you hiding them and all that?

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,150
What does that have to
do with Jesus dying on the Cross?

40
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:15,625
It is symbolic?

41
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:18,731
Are you trying to reference something
that happened in Biblical times?

42
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:19,732
Answer me!

43
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,055
Look, kid ahh,
I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.

44
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,101
I know that!

45
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:26,359
But I figure you must have
some knowledge of what Easter's about

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,927
if you're playing the
Easter Bunny at the mall!

47
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:31,582
Easter's just Easter.
Just, just go with it, kid.

48
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:35,782
NO, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm
gonna find out what's behind all this!

49
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:38,808
I need a break. Can I have a break?

50
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,569
We have a problem.

51
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,327
Somebody's onto us.

52
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,627
Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions.

53
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:55,697
Only a matter of time before
he finds out what Easter's really about.

54
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:58,312
Yes, I understand what must be done.

55
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,500
Call the others.

56
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:14,008
<i></i>

57
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:42,558
Mom? Dad?

58
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,685
Anybody home??

59
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:48,578
Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet!

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,380
- Dad! You've gotta help me!
- Hang on, I'm taking a crap.

61
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,339
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!

62
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,139
What?

63
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,740
They chased me from the mall!
I don't know what they want!

64
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:00,090
They're coming in! Dad, open the DOOR!

65
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:05,635
Dad??

66
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,476
We... need to talk, Stan.

67
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:11,083
Ih, it's okay guys.

68
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,390
- Randy?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,339
'Cause it turns out the
kid we're after is my son.

70
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:18,892
Ohhh.

71
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,889
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay.

72
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,407
I'll take it from here.

73
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:27,473
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan.

74
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:30,499
I really wanted to wait
until you were older but...

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,557
you just had to keep asking questions!

76
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,677
Why were those other
rabbit guys chasing me?!

77
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:37,749
We have to be careful when
we think somebody's onto us.

78
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,856
We are all part of
a secret society, Stan.

79
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,703
A very ancient,
very important society of men

80
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:48,330
who follow the way of the Rabbit, and
protect the secret of the Easter bunny.

81
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,670
We are called... the Hare Club For Men.

82
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,095
Does Mom know about this?

83
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,288
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men.
Chicks wouldn't understand.

84
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:00,895
I don't understand!

85
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,698
I belong to a secret society that
has been around for thousands of years!

86
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:06,798
Our identities have to be protected!

87
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:08,948
Could, could you,
take off, the ears, please?

88
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:11,524
Stan, you don't seem to
understand how serious this is!

89
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,100
The secret of Easter that we protect

90
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,080
is something that could rock
the foundation of the entire world!

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,970
So what is the secret of Easter?

92
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,470
I can't tell you. You have to be
allowed into the Society first, but...

93
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,258
but perhaps... it's time.

94
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,913
I always knew this day would come,

95
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,519
when my son would be
brought into the society.

96
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,830
Reminds me of the day
I was brought in by my father.

97
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,221
- Grandpa's in it too?
- Of course.

98
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,154
Marshes have been in the
Hare Club For Men for generations.

99
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:42,754
All the way back to the beginning.

100
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,353
Dad, do I have to wear this
bag over my head the entire time?

101
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:49,804
You aren't a member yet. You can't know
where our secret meetings take place.

102
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:51,937
We're going to a distant location,

103
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,717
an old building near
a lake about 40 minutes away.

104
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,967
You mean the old Galveston Lodge?

105
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,045
Damnit.

106
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,841
- Hey Bill.
- Evenin' Marcus.

107
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:11,741
- Heh heh hey, look at you!
- Hey everybody.

108
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,830
Stan Marsh, welcome!
You must be very excited.

109
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,666
Must I?

110
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:22,299
There he is! There's my grandson!

111
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:25,321
- Hi Grandpa.
- I'm proud of ya, Billy.

112
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,171
...Stan.

113
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:51,612
Tonight, we determine if a new member
is worthy of protecting the Secret.

114
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,791
Bring out... the rabbit.

115
00:06:55,518 --> 00:07:02,183
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.

116
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:07,023
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.

117
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:13,586
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.

118
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:19,386
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.

119
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:27,523
All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!

120
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,488
Hail Snowball.

121
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:30,853
Stan Marsh,

122
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:34,103
are you ready to hear
the secret of Easter?

123
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,552
- Yeah.
- Are you sure, son?

124
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:40,135
Once you hear the secret, you will be
bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.

125
00:07:40,185 --> 00:07:41,835
Yeah, I wanna know already.

126
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,409
Very well.

127
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:47,103
At the Last Supper,
Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples.

128
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:48,408
It was there that-

129
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:54,793
- They found us!
- Protect Snowball!

130
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,641
They're everywhere!

131
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,670
Come on, we've gotta go!

132
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,258
Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!

133
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:21,058
- Where am I supposed to go?
- JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!!

134
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,122
Where is the rabbit?!

135
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,825
Where are you taking us??

136
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,070
No! I'm not goin' anywhere!

137
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:45,748
Jesus Christ!

138
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,671
Who did you give the rabbit to?!

139
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:55,158
Search the area!
The boy could not have gotten far!

140
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:56,399
Oh no...

141
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,041
Help.

142
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,740
What happened?

143
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,630
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping
cult called the Hare Club For Men

144
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:18,311
they protect the secret of
Easter but before they said what it was

145
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,832
they were attacked by ninjas
and put me in charge of Snowball.

146
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,646
...I'm kind of fingerpainting right now.

147
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,862
Dude, they took my Dad away.
They even shot one of his fellow hares.

148
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:29,509
And now they're after me!

149
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,697
Do you know anything about Easter?

150
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:33,533
What is the connection between
Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?

151
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:37,177
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.

152
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:45,645
Nelson.

153
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,605
Nelson? Nelson, say something.

154
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,882
My legs. I... I think they're broken.

155
00:09:53,185 --> 00:09:55,945
Nelson, do you know where we are?
Where did they take us?

156
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:00,995
Don't know... we traveled for hours...
kept blacking out...

157
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,285
You...

158
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,945
Hi, we'd like to speak
to a Professor Teabag?

159
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:19,402
- What is it in regard to?
- The history of Easter.

160
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:24,574
Sorry boys, it's a little
late for me to be giving lectures.

161
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:28,564
Please? Do you know anything
about the Hare Club For Men?

162
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:33,888
The Keepers?
The Guardians of the Secret?

163
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,104
My Dad is in it.
This... rabbit is too somehow.

164
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:38,204
Come on in.

165
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,125
The Hare Club For Men
has been around for centuries.

166
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:47,675
One of its most famous
members was Leonardo da Vinci.

167
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:51,973
Behold the Last Supper.

168
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:56,615
The dinner Christ had with his disciples
the night before he was crucified.

169
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:59,541
What food do you see on the table?

170
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,567
- Just bread...
- Really?

171
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,720
Look to Jesus' right.

172
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,070
The food which is a little
different color than the others.

173
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,449
It kind of looks like... an egg.

174
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,318
Yes. The egg marks the secret.

175
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,675
It lies directly in front of...
Saint Peter.

176
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,375
Who is Saint Peter?

177
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,111
He was the disciple that
Jesus made into the first pope.

178
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,386
Eggsactly.

179
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:25,812
But there's something
the Church didn't tell you.

180
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,812
In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all.

181
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,058
Saint Peter... was a rabbit.

182
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,164
Peter Rabbit.

183
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:38,255
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow
da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit,

184
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:42,653
so he painted him as a man,
but left clues. Look closely.

185
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,646
- I don't see it.
- Look closelier.

186
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:50,418
- He looks like a guy.
- Look more closelier.

187
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:56,261
With laser technology
we can look beneath the paint,

188
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,013
the way da Vinci originally painted it.

189
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,661
That... is Saint Peter.

190
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,909
The original Pope of Christianity.

191
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,251
I don't believe it.

192
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:11,818
Proof is everywhere. Look
at the Pope's hat. It makes no sense,

193
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:15,418
except that it was originally
designed... for a rabbit.

194
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:18,380
But why would Jesus want
a rabbit to run his church?

195
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,672
Because Jesus knew no one man

196
00:12:20,722 --> 00:12:22,851
could speak for everyone in a religion.

197
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,889
Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure.

198
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:29,127
But the Catholic Church buried
the truth, put a man in charge,

199
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:32,032
and the Hare Club For Men
has been decorating eggs ever since

200
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:35,352
to keep the secret in
da Vinci's painting alive.

201
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:38,802
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?

202
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,790
You dare to mock God by telling
people St. Peter was a rabbit?

203
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,290
You monster!
You have no right to wear that hat!

204
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,030
Trying to tell people that St.
Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy!

205
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:01,684
You must admit you
are wrong or burn in hell!

206
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,574
It's saying stupid things like that

207
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,992
that made Jesus wanna
put a rabbit in charge.

208
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,414
I'm sorry I couldn't bring
you the rabbit, Your Holiness,

209
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:10,021
but they know where it is!

210
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:13,015
The rabbit you call Snowball
is a threat to Christ's Church.

211
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,637
Where is the rabbit?!

212
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:18,433
I don't know! And even if I did know...

213
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:21,676
well, I'd probably tell you
because I don't wanna be here anymore.

214
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:25,442
- Take him to be tortured!
- Tortured, huh, but Bill,

215
00:13:25,492 --> 00:13:29,653
all this... torturing and ninjas,
it just doesn't seem very Christian.

216
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:32,260
You asked for the help
of the American Catholic League,

217
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,724
let us do our job! Take him!

218
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:38,941
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards!
Don't do this!

219
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:45,230
I don't get it. Why would the pope
be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?

220
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,059
I believe Snowball must be a
direct descendant of St. Peter himself,

221
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:51,695
and therefor the true
heir of the pope's throne.

222
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,884
Mr. Teabag! Get out!

223
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,827
- They found me!
- Boys, get out of here!

224
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:06,982
Head to the woods!
I'll try to buy you some time.

225
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:08,441
Check upstairs!

226
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:10,085
<i></i>

227
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,733
Upstairs clear! Try the office!

228
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:22,371
In here!

229
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,266
What's that?

230
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,005
PEEEEPS!

231
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,100
So what now?

232
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,900
If the pope has my Dad...

233
00:14:41,685 --> 00:14:43,220
I have to give him what he wants.

234
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,022
You aren't just gonna
hand Snowball over?

235
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:48,768
What choice do I have?!
There's nobody left who can help us!

236
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:49,718
Wait...

237
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:51,708
unless...

238
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,049
maybe there is.

239
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,127
Here, hold this.

240
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,210
Jesus,

241
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,651
I know we haven't talked in a long time,

242
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:09,424
and I know that every time you appear
we end up killing you somehow, but...

243
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,274
I don't know what to do.

244
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,879
And I could really use your help.

245
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,341
I think the rabbit
just crapped on my jacket.

246
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:31,493
<i>Live, from the Vatican,
it's our Easter Vigil coverage.</i>

247
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:36,611
As Holy Saturday comes to an end,
the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins.

248
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:41,383
Thousand have turned out to hear
the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.

249
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,824
For this Easter vigil the
Pope is also showing his divine grace

250
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:48,624
by feeding the poor,
with a massive rabbit stew.

251
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,833
NOOO!

252
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:52,626
Noo! No, don't put m-

253
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:55,831
Bill, this seems extreme.

254
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,580
The child who has the rabbit has to know

255
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,984
that we are willing to kill
the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.

256
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:04,184
Your Holiness,
a child has arrived witha the rabbit!

257
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,539
Ya see?

258
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,728
Oh thank God!

259
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,822
Hand it over, Stan! They're
gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!

260
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,324
Yes, hand it over!

261
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,459
First, you have to
promise you won't hurt it!

262
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,260
And that you'll let everybody go!

263
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,548
- We promise.
- We swear it, on the cross.

264
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:24,831
JUST HAND OVER THE BUNNY, STAN!!

265
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,331
Okay, fine.

266
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,226
Stanley, why did you do that?

267
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:33,264
I would have proudly
died for that rabbit.

268
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:35,380
- You said "hand over the bunny."
- No!

269
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,192
That is NOT the way
we're remembering it!

270
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:38,993
Take them into custody!

271
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,541
Hey, what the hell!

272
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,995
Bill, we have zeh rabbit,
it's all we need.

273
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:44,731
Don't be soft, Your Holiness!

274
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:47,391
These "whores" must be
punished in front of everyone!

275
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,510
You swore on the cross, fatso!

276
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,832
Yeah. Too bad for you...

277
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,732
it was a double cross!

278
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,867
Oh, we should've seen that coming!

279
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,903
Bill, I'm not sure that double
crossing people is very Christian.

280
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,303
IT IS WHAT CHRIST WOULD'VE WANTED!

281
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:05,723
Who are you to say that?!

282
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,036
It... can't be.

283
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,203
Jesus!

284
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:18,417
<i>	He is risen. He is risen.</i>

285
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:24,201
<i>Let the voices sing
his praises on this holy day.</i>

286
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,676
<i>He is risen!</i>

287
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:29,876
Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.

288
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:33,328
I have the power of resurrection.
Or have you forgotten?

289
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,997
You all seem to have
forgotten a lot of things.

290
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,724
Jesus, you did answer my prayer!

291
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,462
Actually, I was answering
the prayer of Nick Donovan.

292
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,312
Ohh, that's me Neato!

293
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:46,259
This is exactly why I put a rabbit
in charge of the Church, Benedictus!

294
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,001
Because men are so easily led astray.

295
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:53,187
St. Peter was a rabbit.
And a rabbit should be Pope.

296
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,456
- Kill him!
- WHAT?!

297
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,523
He goes against the Church. He must die!

298
00:17:58,524 --> 00:17:59,729
All right, that does it, Bill.

299
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,782
I'm pretty sure that killing
Jesus is not very Christian.

300
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:07,132
You are soft!
Weak! You leave me no choice: take them!

301
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,710
What are you doing?!

302
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,960
I am the Pope!

303
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,293
You are no longer able to
fulfill your duties to the Lord!

304
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,722
The Easter vigil will go on as planned!

305
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,977
Every Hare Club member, young and old,

306
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:20,805
will watch as their
precious savior dies!

307
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:22,650
What is your problem, guy?!

308
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,140
Lock up those two Jews!
We'll deal with them later.

309
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:27,920
No! No!

310
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,774
A strange turn of events
here at the Vatican:

311
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,988
Pope Benedictus has stepped down,

312
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,991
ushering the new era of...
Pope Bill Donohue

313
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:37,663
My people!

314
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:40,935
This Easter I'm gonna
start by making our rabbit stew

315
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,985
ten times meatier!

316
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,942
No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!

317
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:51,436
Forgive me, Jesus.

318
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:53,475
We'll never get out in time to stop him!

319
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:55,505
Don't you have any superpowers?

320
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:58,644
Not as a mortal. Only in death.

321
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,313
Wait. That's it.

322
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:04,136
We have no choice, Kyle.
You're going to have to kill me.

323
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,456
- What??
- Stab me with this.

324
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,718
If I die I can resurrect
outside the bars.

325
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,968
N-no way! Do it yourself.

326
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,146
Suicide is blasphemy.
There's no choice here, Kyle!

327
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,050
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I
have a few hangups about killing Jesus.

328
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,050
Just make it quick. Through the neck.
I'll arise again immediately.

329
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,212
Don't make me do this.

330
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:28,713
My son, there is no time! DO IT!

331
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,627
Eric Cartman can never know about this.

332
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,963
I understand. And Kyle,

333
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,141
- happy Easter.
- Happy Easter, Jesus.

334
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:52,837
...Jesus?

335
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:58,464
Behold, no longer will Easter
be about bunnies and colored eggs!

336
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:00,453
Kill the rabbit!

337
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,845
Sorry, little bunny.

338
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,740
Snowball!

339
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,531
Jesus?

340
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:15,676
Stop!

341
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:18,193
That rabbit is of holy descent!

342
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:20,846
Why won't you go away?!

343
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,310
One man cannot be
the voice of the Church!

344
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,602
Enough of this blasphemy!
I'm the Pope now!

345
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:31,173
That means I am the voice of God!!

346
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:35,167
Not anymore.
I'm removing you from your position.

347
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,916
YAAAY!!!

348
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,368
All right Jesus!

349
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:03,777
<i>Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.</i>

350
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:08,890
<i>Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.</i>

351
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,518
Your Holiness,

352
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:14,218
what should we tell the world
about how to run their lives?

353
00:21:16,581 --> 00:21:18,269
It isn't saying anything.

354
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,176
Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.

355
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,604
Stanley, I'm so proud of you.

356
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,700
You've learned so very much this Easter.

357
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,581
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions.

358
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:31,382
Just dye the eggs
and keep my mouth shut.

359
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:32,784
That's my boy.

360
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:37,193
<i>Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.</i>
