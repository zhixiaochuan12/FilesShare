00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,500
..:: SOUTH PARK 1103 ::..

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,207


3
00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:11,485
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,802
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,145
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

6
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,492
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,683
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,047
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,282
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,200
All right students, let's take our seats.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Appearently we have a little problem here at the school, which we need to talk about.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,200
Ah yes, you mean the jew problem.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,800
Good good. I'm glad, we're
finally gonna do something about it.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
No, I mean the problem of head lice.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,200
There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver,
and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,200
- Somebody might have lice?
- Ewww!

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,100
So today you're all going to
the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,300
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary.
Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice..

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,900
The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.

20
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,901
(What? Fuck you!) 

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone HAS the lice,

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
we can stop it before it spreads.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,800
Lice can live in anybody's hair.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,800
You mean me or the little one?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
I mean both.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting
for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,000
How did a louse like me get so
lucky to have a louse like you?

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,700
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
You okay?

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,500
Sometimes... I just worry what kind of
world our babih is gonna grow up in.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,000
I need to run up to the forest
and do another sediment analysis.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,900
All students, make sure you're
in line according to your grade.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,200
When you reach the front of the line
you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked.

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
What do you think happens if you do have it?

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,500
They drag you out of here,
put you in this big containment facility,

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,800
where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass
with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice!

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,600
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can
send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.

42
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,601
(Hey! Fuck you!)

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,800
Have a seat on the stool.

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,200
- Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
- What?

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,300
You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,100
Oh my God. Oh Christ no!

47
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,100
Now now, it's all right. We're going to call
your parents and get you to your doctor.

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Please, ya-you don't understand.
The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,400
- I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
- Yes they are!

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. President! Mr. President!
I believe we have a serious problem!

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,400
The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,400
And what do you base this on?

53
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Look, this is the world, right?

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,500
But now, think of the world as... a living being.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,400
If it were somehow conscious, then it would
ultimately become aware of our effect on it.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,600
Huh right, the world is conscious.
It makes perfect sense.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
Hello. Anybody?

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,600
If we have made too much of an impact,
then that consciousness would try to snuff us out!

59
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,500
I think we're looking at a global catastrophe,
the likes of which we've never seen!

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,300
Poodiggery and poppycock!

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,800
I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation,
perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.

62
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,100
Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival.
Do you know how much money we would lose?

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,300
Escort Mr. Mayfield out.
The President can't be bothered any further.

64
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,600
Damn you Vice President Craig!
You could be killin' us all!

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,500
This is so... embarassing.

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,100
I have an ear infection.
What are you seeing the doctor for?

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I have... I have AIDS.

68
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,300
Clyde Harris?

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,700
Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there.
Good thing they pulled you out of school.

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,400
But why me, doctor?? Why me?!
How did I get this?!

71
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Well, believe it or not, some lice can
actually attach themselves to flies,

72
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,600
and then wait for the fly to land on
someone's head where they can reproduce.

73
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,500
And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.

74
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,500
- ...SICK!
- This shampoo should take care of it.Use this in the shower.

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,500
Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but...
it should kill... every last one of them.

76
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Travis? Everything okay?

77
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih.
I want to name her... Hope.

78
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,300
- Hope?
- Hope for a... chance at tomorrow?

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,200
It's raining? Now?

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,500
"RID-X. KILLS INSTANTLY LICE & THEIR EGGS."

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Woohoo! I love the rain!

82
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh my God.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
- We have to get out of here!
- What it, it's just rain.

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,300
We have to get out of here now, Kellih!

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,100
What is that?

86
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Whoa!

87
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,300
Everyone get up into the trees!
We have to get up high!

88
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Come on, Kelly!

89
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,700
My God, Travis, they're all dying!

90
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!

91
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,600
- What the hell is it?!
- Well it's okay, we're safe up here!

92
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,300
I don't think so!

93
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,200
- Travis!
- Kellih! Hang on!

94
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
I can't... hang on!

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
You have to! For the babih!

96
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Kehhhllihhhh! NO!

97
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,200
NOOOO!!

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Okay, kids, today we're going to
review some Civil War history.

99
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,400
- Who can tell me what year the war started?
- Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?

100
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,500
- With what?
- With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice?

101
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,500
Y-yes, some lice was discovered
and the proper action has been taken.

102
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,700
- Somebody in this class?
- Uh, yes.

103
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,500
Well who was it? It was Kenny, right??

104
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,800
That doesn't matter, it's over.

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites
in their hair, we need to know who!

106
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,300
- It was Keeny, wasn't it?
- I wanna know who it was, too.

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,700
It's being kept confidential!

108
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,900
There's a policy in the schools not to single out
a kid who has lice, because of the embarassment it can cause, okay?!

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
That is bullcrap!

110
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,600
You are denying our rights as children to totally rip
on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!

111
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,300
- Yeah!
- And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!

112
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,000
How do we know it was a boy?
It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!

113
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Yeah! Dumb girls!

114
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,200
The case is closed!
Whoever had the lice, they're dead now!

115
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,000
We're moving on to Civil War history.
Ulysses S. Grant...

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,900
Hope. Hope, you're alive.

117
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,300
My God...

118
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,800
Help me... Help meeee...

119
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,600
Travis. Over here!

120
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,300
Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.

121
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,100
How many survivors?

122
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,700
Just the six of us. And the vice president.

123
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,400
You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this!

124
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,500
So help me, if we live through this,
I'm gonna see you rot in prison!

125
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,700
- What do we do now?
- We aren't out of this yet!

126
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,000
You two look for other survivors.
You get whatever food you can and bring it back here.

127
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Who put you in charge?!

128
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
God did! When he killed my wife!

129
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,600
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now,
so that we know to stay away from you!

130
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,700
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.

131
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead,
you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!

132
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
- You know what? I'll bet it was you!
- Me??

133
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,700
This is exactly what you would do
if they found lice in your hair!

134
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,900
Try to lead the charge against
somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,700
I don't think so, Kyle!

136
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,000
But you know what?! This is exactly
what YOU would do if YOU had had head lice!

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Try to get everyone to blame me!

138
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
You guys stop it!
This isn't getting us anywhere!

139
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,500
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan.

140
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace
so it doesn't seem like a big deal.

141
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
And this is exactly what Kenny would do:
stand here and say nothing!

142
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,200
Heh hey guys, what would I do?

143
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,100
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.

144
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,100
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.

145
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,500
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.

146
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,400
There's a way! There's a way to find out
who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it!

147
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,000
It was him. It had to have been him!

148
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Yeah...

149
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
Or you.

150
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.

151
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,000
This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us!
If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.

152
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,300
- How?
- First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,500
It's the only way we might even see another planet!

154
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,700
The forbidden zone...
We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.

155
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,000
We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!

156
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,900
Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?

157
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!

158
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,700
- I'm not leaving my husband.
- Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.

159
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,200
You can all stay here;
I'm gonna try to save my babih.

160
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
I'll go with you.
There's nothing left for me here.

161
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,700
- I wanna go too.
- Not a chance.

162
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,400
Look, I know I messed up, all right?
But I think you're right.

163
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,600
If we can get out of the forest,
we might find another place to live.

164
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,700
If we find anything,
we'll try to send help for the rest of you.

165
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Let's go. Come on
if you're comin' Mister Vice President!

166
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
Yeah. Right behind you.

167
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
All right, lock that door, Craig!

168
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,400
What's this about, Cartman?

169
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,000
I've come up with a test that can determine
if it was any of us who had the head lice.

170
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,400
We're gonna find out once and for all
who had head cooties.

171
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes
they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream.

172
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,700
That saliva, is monochromagnic.

173
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,400
So if an infected person's blood is touched by...
this hot metal coil, say...

174
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
that person's blood will jump
10 meters into the air.

175
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,400
- Ur ur re- ur really?
- That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!

176
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,900
- This is a scientific test, designed to..
- You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!

177
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
I thought you might say that, Kyle.
Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!

178
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,200
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!

179
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
If it isn't going to work,
then what are you afraid of?

180
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,000
The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody
who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with LICE!

181
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,700
Yeah. That's true.

182
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,100
I have no problem taking the test.
I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide

183
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,900
- Yeah. Me neither.
- All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.

184
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,300
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe.
We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.

185
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,900
All right, now everyone back over there!
We'll start with what I already know.

186
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,500
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the onen with head lice.

187
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,500
- It doesn't proe anything!
- Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!

188
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Huh, I guess you're clean.

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Ye-you guys,
we'd better go. Recess is almost over.

190
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
It's all right,
it won't take much longer, just...

191
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
What the hell?!

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,800
- Kenny!!
- No way.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.

194
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Of course I was right!
I told you only poor people get lice!

195
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,500
We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.

196
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,300
I've always heard stories about this place.
Never thought it was real.

197
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,700
It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.

198
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,400
So what exactly is your plan, Travis?

199
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,300
Our ancestors came here from another world.
Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us.

200
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,300
Maybe there's even a world where they've
learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.

201
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,300
Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong.

202
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,600
If we make it out of this,
I'd like to... be with you.

203
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:04,400
Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in
permanent ink with the name Kelly.

204
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,800
- She was a lucky woman to have you.
- Luck had nothin' to do with it.

205
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,600
Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!

206
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Why you murdering bastard!

207
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,800
Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!

208
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,800
- What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
- WALK!

209
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Clyde, dude, get down to the park.
We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it!

210
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
What? What are you gonna do to him?

211
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,100
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind!
We all know what has to happen.

212
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,800
Grab a sock and a bar of soap,
and meet us at the park!

213
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
You guys, wait.

214
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
What, Clyde?

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,300
I... nothing.

216
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,900
- All right, see you there!
Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!  -Yeah!

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah! We're gonna fu-, fu-, fuck him up!

218
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,200
- Yello?
- Mrs. Garrison,

219
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
one of your students is about to be
attacked at the park by all the other students.

220
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,700
What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!

221
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,600
Please just hurry to the park!
You have to stop them!

222
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
That's good! That's far enough!

223
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,400
What are you going to do?

224
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm gonna go back to the village,
start to rebuild,

225
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,300
mate with the females,
become... President!

226
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,400
Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here!
It's not gonna stop until you're dead!

227
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,600
It was a disaster! Disasters happen!

228
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,500
Then go ahead and die there,
I'm leavin' with my babih!

229
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,800
Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis!

230
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,600
Damn you! Why?!

231
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,200
Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive!

232
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,400
You're an idealistic fool!
The world is not "conscious," we are conscious!

233
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,000
If the world was alive, it would feel this!

234
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
You die he...

235
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,000
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school,
and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!

236
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,001
(Not guilty!) 

237
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
Guilty! I thought so!

238
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,100
- All right, let's do this!
- You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?

239
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen!

240
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,400
SOCK BATH!

241
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,700
Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks!

242
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Wait... stop it, stop it!

243
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,000
I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.

244
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,200
- He had cooties and he lied about it!
- Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!

245
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
-  It was me.
- What?

246
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,600
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything,
but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.

247
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,600
Why are you saying that, Kyle?
You can't be the one who had head lice.

248
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,600
Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad
because you figured that out, didn't you?!

249
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,600
- Wait a-wait a minute, what?
- Oh I get it. This is some kind of big trick on me!

250
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
You had head lice??

252
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,500
Of course! Why do you think I went through that
elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!

253
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,000
You all had head lice! Every single person in the class!

254
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,400
The boys aaand the girls!
Lice spreads fast, you dumbasses!

255
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,700
- I thought I was the only one.
- Me too.

256
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,100
But that means... that means Kenny WAS lying!

257
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,200
- Sock bath!
- Yeah. Sock bath!

258
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,300
Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih?

259
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I don't know if you can.

260
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,000
But... I wanted you to know I tried.
I tried to save our babih.

261
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
But I let you down, babe.

262
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,700
Keh... k-Kellih?

263
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,300
You are welcome here.

264
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,200
You're safe now. We've lived here for
generation after generation, never being disturbed.

265
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,000
Heh. We made it, Hope.
WE MADE IT, KELLIH!!

266
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,700
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie!

267
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,500
Hello everyone!

268
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Hello!
