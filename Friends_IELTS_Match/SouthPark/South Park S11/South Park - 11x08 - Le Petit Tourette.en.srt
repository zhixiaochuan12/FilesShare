Asshole! Shit, shit! Cock!

12
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,670
Ma'am, is that your son over there?

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,820
Yes, I'm sorry.
My son has Tourette's Syndrome.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,120
Tourette's Syndrome?

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,880
It's a neurological disorder.
He-he can't control what he says.

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,850
Oh!

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,320
Shiit! Dumb shiiit!

18
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,490
A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,460
All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,310
Here, let's buy you
a nice toy to take home.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,260
Dude, that mom is kewl.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,750
Cockbutt! Augh... Stupid shit!

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,960
Are you talkin' to me?!

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,750
No. Cocknose!

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,200
What's your problem, kid?!

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,880
Oh, a-I'm sorry.
My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome.

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,650
What?

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,680
Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,640
People with Tourette's can't control
certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,130
Asshole ASSHOLE.

31
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,680
Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa.

32
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,390
You're telling me there's an illness
that makes you blurt out obscenities?

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,190
Mom, can we just go home, please?

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,330
It's okay, Thomas. They understand.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,010
I want tuh go!

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,150
Poor kid!

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,810
Yeah!

38
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,610
All right, hold on just a second here:

39
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,370
Are you telling me that if you have
this Tourette's Syndrome

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,510
you can say whatever you want,

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,430
all the time, and never get in trouble?

42
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,380
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,350
Yeah!

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:25,220
I've got a golden ticket.. I've got a golden
twinkle in my eye.

45
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,670
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?

46
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,430
I don't need the toy!
I've found something better!

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,070
'Cause I've got a golden ticket!

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,380
I've got a golden change to make my way!

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,090
It started about four days ago, Doctor,
and every day he seems to get worse.

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,970
- Puh-Pussy!... Pussy! Cock! Shit!
- Oh dear!

51
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,190
I was checking out
the Internet and ih,

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,590
it almost seems like his symptoms are
like those in something called

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,750
"Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,920
Tourette's Syndrome?

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,140
What is that, Mommy?
Butthole! Titties! Balls!

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,290
That doesn't seem likely.

57
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,580
Tourette's is a hereditary disease;
it doesn't just suddenly start.

58
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,980
..Cocksucker!

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,850
On the other hand, Tourette's
does often develop later in a child's life,

60
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,640
getting progressively worse.

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh wuh, well that's it!

62
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,940
Shithead! Asshole!
Mexican sticky balls!

63
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,820
Oh Doctor, can you help him?

64
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,430
We don't know very much
about Tourette's I'm afraid.

65
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,950
But we will give your son
all the help we can.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,600
But what about school, Doctor?

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,230
The teachers and the principal, they won't
understand that I can't control what I say.

68
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,720
Don't worry, young man.

69
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,350
We'll make sure everyone understands your disease
and gives you the compassion you deserve.

70
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,840
Ohohh, that's awesome.
Thank you. Faggot!

71
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,820
Shit! Butthole!

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,760
Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.

73
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,480
Titties! Cock!

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,830
Ginger retard!
Asslicker dickface!

75
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,550
Dude, you'd better watch it.
The principal's right over there.

76
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,110
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria.

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,280
Shitballs!

78
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,730
Good morning, Eric.

79
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,070
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?

80
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,020
Huhyou didn't hear?

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,540
Well Cartman has some, mental disease
called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.

82
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,310
What?

83
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,010
He's the luckiest kid in the world.

84
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,480
If I could say "shitballs" to
the principal I'd be sooo happy.

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,970
Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I,

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,450
I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics.

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,430
Asshole! Pussy asshole!

88
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,070
Ach, augh, I just want you to know
that I can't control it.

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,720
It's okay, Eric. We all understand
and we think you're very brave.

90
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,050
He's faking.

91
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,060
Excuse me everyone, I need to have
a moment alonen with my good friend Kyle?

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,320
Asscheeks!

93
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,710
Kyle, apparently you missed
the school assembly yesterday,

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,460
but I've been diagnosed with a
very serious mental condition.

95
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,160
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!

96
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,590
Oh, okay, you figured me out.

97
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,100
Bravo, Kyle, bravo.

98
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,650
Don't you see how awesome this is?

99
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,370
It's like, a magic cloak that makes
me impervious to getting in trouble.

100
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,020
- Who cares about saying whatever you-?
- Of course, if you want to be Sgt Buzzkill once again,

101
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,710
and spoil my fun because you're jealous you
didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.

102
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,040
Grrhh, whatever.

103
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,380
Good morning, Mr. Mackey.
Asspussy!

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,450
If I could say "asspussy"
to the counselor I would be sooo happy.

105
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,670
Okay, so what do we get when
we multiply a negative number-?

106
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,570
Dicktits!

107
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,450
-when we multiply a negative
number by another negative-?

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Shit! Asshole!

109
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,110
'Scuse me.

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Ih if we apply what we've just learned,
we see that all negatives can-

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,790
Spooge balls bloody vaginal belch.

112
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
You guys, don't laugh.

113
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,820
It makes me feel insecure about my illness.

114
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,030
All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?

115
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,920
Now all you need to remember
here is that negative numbers

116
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,190
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,870
Will you knock it off already?!

118
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,540
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could?
I'd give anything to be normal like you.

119
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,040
Kike!

120
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,830
Don't push me, asshole!

121
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,720
Kyle, watch your language!

122
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,770
If I could yell "tampon dickshit"
in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.

123
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,910
Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has
become such a distraction I,

124
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,150
I don't think I can teach my class anymore.

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,350
I understand it's been difficult,
Mrs. Garrison, and so,

126
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,800
Mr. Donaldson has come

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,690
from the Tourette's Tolerance
and Understanding Foundation.

128
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,130
Hello Mrs. Garrison-

129
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,180
Ass. ASS!

130
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,640
I want to help your class better
understand this illness. PISS!

131
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,450
- No! Up yours, fatboy!
- Kyle please! I'm sorry!

132
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,890
Principal Victoria,
there's something you need to know!

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,740
Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!

134
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,810
Faking?

135
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,130
You think people with Tourette's are faking?!

136
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,770
N-no, I'm just saying that I think-

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,960
Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?

138
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,700
Ass! ASS!

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,990
We aren't "faking", young man. Trust me,

140
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,400
nobody wants this illness, ass. Piss!

141
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,760
PIISS!

142
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,590
That's right, Kyle.
Crap-filled vagina!

143
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,410
This is the kind of intolerance you teach
at this school, Principal Victoria?!

144
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,020
No.

145
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,210
This if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to take this "bully"

146
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,730
to see that Tourette's is very real. Piss!

147
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,220
Kids, today during therapy class
we have a special visitor.

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,210
ASS!

149
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,660
I, I wanted him to meet all of you
so he could try to understand Tourette's

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,680
Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.
It isn't contagious like some people think.

151
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,270
A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics.
My tic...

152
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,190
is that I have to bend my neck and snap my fingers.
But a lot of people don't even notice it.

153
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,670
Aw shit! COCK!

154
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,750
Sometimes it can be embarrassing
to have Tourette's, but I... Boop!

155
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,710
I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.

156
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,790
You see? These kids
can't control their actions.

157
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,240
Ass! Piss iin the ass!

158
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,530
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe
this one person could control what he said,

159
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,810
but just didn't, for fun.

160
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,710
Fun?

161
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,240
This really isn't all that fun. Brrrr!

162
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,680
Aw shit!

163
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,740
Boop!

164
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,590
Piss coming from my ass!

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
Yee-you wanna know about fun?

166
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,130
Going to public places knowing
you're going to make a fool of yourself.

167
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,260
Embarrass your parents. Aw shit!

168
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,580
My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore.

169
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,590
He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around,

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,870
but I only see him at Christmastime now.
S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit!

171
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,300
The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is.

172
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,620
A lot of times I know
she'd be better off if I was dead.

173
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,810
Dude!

174
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,900
Your mom would not be better off
if you were dead, Thomas.

175
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,520
Even if people like Kyle here think so.

176
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,890
Aw, come on!

177
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,620
So then you apologize
for what you said before?

178
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,110
Ah I was just trying to...

179
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,760
just, just in one instance...

180
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,060
No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

181
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,030
Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has
learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful

182
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,800
for making fun of people with disabilities.
Piss. PISS!

183
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,350
Our son is a good kid.

184
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,470
He just didn't understand
Tourette's was a real disease.

185
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,860
Well, I think the only thing left now is
for your son to apologize to his little classmate.

186
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,610
Well Kyle?

187
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,100
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,730
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't
quite make that out, Kyle.

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,540
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,210
You're starry?

191
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,510
I, I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle.
You're starry because uh I don't want it?

192
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh-

193
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,890
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle.
Now I understand.

194
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,470
I've learned to deal with intolerance.

195
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,960
Dumbshit douchebag!

196
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,760
And it means a lot that you're standing here
apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.

197
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,040
Fat Jew! Jew bitch!

198
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,330
Oh thank you Eric!

199
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,540
Thank you. Big-nosed kike!

200
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,410
Well I think we can all put this behind us now.
Piiiss out my aaass!

201
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto
Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!

202
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,410
Oh goodness, 'scuse me.
Jeez, that was a bad one.

203
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,640
Well, gotta run, everybody.
Got some big things in the works.

204
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,560
Isn't having Tourette's awesome?

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Next week on Dateline NBC:
it's a Dateline special report.

206
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm Chris Hansen

207
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,760
You probably know me from To Catch A Predator,
where we bust men looking for sex with children.

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Go ahead and take a seat.
Take a seat right over there.

209
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,220
Oh God, Whoa no.

210
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
What are you doin' here?

211
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,200
I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.

212
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,650
But now we're switching our focus
from pedophiles to Tourette's syndrome.

213
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,370
It all started when I received this touching letter
from a brave little boy in Colorado.

214
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,830
Dear Mr Hansen, I have Tourette's and
I want the world to understand what it's like.

215
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,870
Won't you do a special report on me,

216
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,500
so the world can learn
to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh?

217
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,190
Donkey Boner!!!

218
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,100
This Saturday on Dateline I'll
be bringing you Eric's story, live

219
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,790
and uncensored,
from his home in Colorado.

220
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,770
Livingn with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story.
This Saturday on Dateline NBC

221
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,410
Finally, my wish of going public
with my illness can come true.

222
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,630
Goddamn Jews!
Suck my ass barf!

223
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,170
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!

224
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,100
What's this about you going
on live television on Saturday?!

225
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,490
Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.

226
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,040
The final cog in my... master plan.

227
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,750
This Saturday I will go
on national television, live.

228
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,750
I will say ...horrible things on the air.
Unspeakable things.

229
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,430
And people will call me brave.

230
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,050
Cartman, there are people in the world
who really have Tourette's Syndrome.

231
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,710
This isn't funny!

232
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,570
Not funny?

233
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,450
I have free rein to say anything I want
and you get into trouble if you try and stop me.

234
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,940
Care for a Scotch?

235
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,770
Scotch?

236
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,120
Kyle I've won!
No matter how you look at it!

237
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,870
I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever
I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table,

238
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,610
but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want...

239
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,020
on national television.

240
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle.

241
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,660
I'm going to call them every name in the book,
and people wlll call it brilliant television.

242
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,400
They'll probably give me an Emmy.

243
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,150
You are not going to go on national television and
spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people!

244
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,410
I WON'T LET YOU DO IT, CARTMAN!

245
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,530
Then the game is on, Kyle.

246
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,310
It's not a game, you derelict!

247
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,710
And this isn't Scotch!
It's apple juice!

248
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,320
Do you have any idea how liberating
it is to say whatever comes to mind?

249
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,180
"Big titties! Buttmumch!"

250
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,590
There's no walls anymore! "Shit!"

251
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,860
Whatever enters my brain I can
just say without thinking about it.

252
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
"I wet my bed last night."

253
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,710
What did you say?

254
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,880
Uhh nuh-nothing...

255
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,200
You aren't gonna get away
with this you stupid asshole!

256
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,174
Hm. That was... weird.

257
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:23,380
We are here today
to congratulate a brave little boy.

258
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:26,573
Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television

259
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,249
and become the spokesman
for Tourette's Syndrome.

260
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,950
Piiiss out my aaass!

261
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:35,843
The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...
Cock!

262
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,785
Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!

263
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,782
You've all been so understanding
and supportive of my illness.

264
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,453
Jews bomber dick sneeze.

265
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,109
And it is because of you...

266
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,874
that I have the courage to go
on national television tonight.

267
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,234
Titty sprinkles.

268
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:57,000
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national
television I would be sooo happy.

269
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,548
And I also just want to say that...
I'm making this all up!

270
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:10,380
Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you,
for putting up with my mental disorder.

271
00:14:10,513 --> 00:14:12,509
I cry at night because I don't have a dad.

272
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:15,614
What the hell is going on?

273
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,881
Uhit's okay, Eric.
We understand your illness, m'kay?

274
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:22,533
No hey ut what, what I meant
to say was "asslicker cumballs".

275
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:25,046
And I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson.

276
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,175
I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson!

277
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:30,147
Eewwww!

278
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,390
Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet!
Bathroom! Bathroom!

279
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:40,600
Uh hey Eric!

280
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,425
Butters, do you think it's possible that you
can lose the ability to filter what you say?

281
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,156
I mean, if somebody got used to
saying whatever came to their mind,

282
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,802
could they start saying things
that they would normally never say?

283
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:55,443
Wuh who are you talking about?

284
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:56,744
Uh, my cousin.

285
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,731
My cousin one time
my cousin and I touched wieners.

286
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,059
You... you and your cousin
touched wieners?

287
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:10,169
I didn't say that YES I DID
BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it!

288
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,983
Excuse me! Excuse me,
I gotta go! I gotta run!

289
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:15,491
Is there a problem, sweetie?

290
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:16,970
No, no problem.

291
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:19,646
I just need to... Argh!
My cousin and I touched each other's-

292
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,549
I just... no I...

293
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,654
I just want to thank everyone for coming-
my cousin and I touched wiener-

294
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:30,675
we wiener we, weenter!
Winter is a cold time of year.

295
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:32,449
Ah, I need to be going now.

296
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:35,436
Well all right Eric.
Well good luck on Dateline tonight.

297
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,801
Dateline. Right.

298
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,028
I wet my b-AAA!

299
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:41,305
I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH!

300
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:44,011
This sure has been fun! G'bye!

301
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:51,566
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome.

302
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,473
I'm Chris Hansen.

303
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,474
I'm Chris Hansen.

304
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,908
Ah, Mr. Hansen?

305
00:15:58,115 --> 00:15:59,963
I'm afraid I can't do the show.

306
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,265
Why not?

307
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:03,172
My uh, my grandma just died,

308
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:06,277
so I have to go to Memphis-
That's not true. My grandma's fine.

309
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,411
Why don't you have a seat?

310
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,791
No I just need to get home.
I'm not doin' the show.

311
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,077
Go ahead and take a seat.

312
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:13,846
But I'm not gonna do the-

313
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,354
Take a seat, right over there.

314
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,706
What are you doing here?

315
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:24,003
I'm, I'm telling you that
I'm not doing the show?

316
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:25,289
But you are doing the show.

317
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:28,660
You don't understand!
All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.

318
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,691
Well of course you can't coontrol
what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.

319
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,096
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse!

320
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:36,274
Before I just blurted out cool stuff
about Jews being lame and stuff.

321
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:37,797
But now it's gotten really bad.

322
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:41,301
So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin'
the show, that's it. Goodbye.

323
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:42,824
Why don't you take a seat?

324
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:43,874
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!

325
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:44,642
Have a seat.

326
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,663
No, I'm just gonna go-

327
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:46,934
Take a seat, right over there.

328
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,630
How does he do that?

329
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,986
You know, one tiiime, I was doin'
a show called "To Catch A Predator".

330
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:58,451
We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan
from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline.

331
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:02,399
So we tracked him down to his hoouuse.
And you know what he did?

332
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,690
He shot himself.

333
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:08,919
It'd be a shame if...
you didn't wanna go on Dateline.

334
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:14,286
Be a shame if we had to track you
down and you "shot" "yourself."

335
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:24,664
Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado.
This! ...is Dateline.

336
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:27,887
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome.

337
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:32,766
I'm Chris Hansen.

338
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,679
In a few minutes, you will
meet little Eric Cartman,

339
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,251
who wants the world
to understand his affliction.

340
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,297
Five minutes, kid.

341
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:44,032
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?

342
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:48,970
God? Please uh, I know I screwed up.

343
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:53,287
I should have never pretended to have
Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now.

344
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:55,712
You can't just walk around
saying whatever you want.

345
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:59,127
You gave us a filter because,
people don't wanna hear things like

346
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,951
"I touched penises with my cousin!"
Ahaab, ahaabuh!

347
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:06,032
And, and I learned, you especially can't
say whatever you want on national televison,

348
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:07,909
'cause, there could be kids watching.

349
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:11,399
Please, God, don't make me
embarrass myself on national television.

350
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,050
You... must see how this is all
somewhat your fault, right?

351
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,155
Please. I need a miracle.

352
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:25,873
Tango, this is Foxtrot.
Are you in position?

353
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,844
Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position.

354
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:30,057
Awww, shit!

355
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:32,008
You sure you don't wanna back out?

356
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,699
Nono, you were right.
The fat kid is faking it!

357
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,242
If he goes on TV, more people will think
that having Tourette's is fun.

358
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:38,632
Asshole shit!

359
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:41,559
All right, then we go with the plan.
Just like "To Catch A Predator."

360
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:45,640
The first guy is here.
This is probably HotForBoys219.

361
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:51,213
Hi, are you CuteBilly182?

362
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,889
Yeah. I was chatting
with you online. SHIT!

363
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,344
Oh God, I'm so turned on right now.

364
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:59,079
This is your house?
Your, your parents aren't home, are they?

365
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:03,115
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside.
I made brownies. SHIT!

366
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,309
I'm just gonna slip into something
more comf'table. COCK!

367
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:09,605
Okay. Cock! Don't take too long.

368
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:15,800
So now let's meet a child who
haaas Tourette's Syndrooome,

369
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,146
and who must fi-

370
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:20,576
Ho, whoa, wait a minute.

371
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,054
This ain't no house.

372
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,666
What are you doing?!

373
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,416
Chris Hansen?!

374
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:28,426
Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!

375
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:30,274
Sir, why don't you take
a seat, right over there.

376
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,817
Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv!

377
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,367
Aw, not again.

378
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:42,649
Kyle?

379
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,142
Surprise, fatass!

380
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,458
Kyle, what are you doing?

381
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,001
I went online posing as a boy
who would have sex with older men,

382
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:49,273
and told them to meet me here.

383
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,165
My plan worked perfectly!

384
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,800
Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.

385
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:06,260
Yeah yeah, go on in.
There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!

386
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:07,842
Score!

387
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,494
Oh no, it's Chris Hansen!

388
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:16,772
What the hell is going on?!

389
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,965
Wait a minute.
Oh God, it's Chris Hansen!

390
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,153
Chris Hansen!

391
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:24,356
Dateline?!

392
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,998
I knew it!

393
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:28,792
There aren't really brownies!

394
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,681
Hey! Do you have something to do with this?

395
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:36,790
Answer meee!

396
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:39,052
Stupid shit! Cock!

397
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:41,832
What?! Nobody talks to me like that!

398
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,168
Why don't you take a seat?
Take a seat, right over there.

399
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,829
Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!

400
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:49,535
Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you!

401
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,793
Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world.

402
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:58,243
If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking
dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.

403
00:20:58,405 --> 00:20:58,849
You would?

404
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:03,181
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime?
Like, do your laundry maybe?

405
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:08,281
Take a look, fatass! I beat you!

406
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,810
You aren't going on Dateline;
what have you got to say now?!

407
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,718
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!

408
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:16,738
What?

409
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:19,651
I asked God to send someone
to help me, and you came, Kyle!

410
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,041
I love you man!

411
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:22,519
No ah I beat you!

412
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,145
You totally saved my ass, Kyle.

413
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:25,993
You must... really care about me.

414
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,176
See you Kyle!

415
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,985
I gotta get to a psychiatrist
and learn to control what I say!

416
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:35,382
I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle!
I got a golden twinkle in my eye!

417
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:40,527
Aww, shit!
