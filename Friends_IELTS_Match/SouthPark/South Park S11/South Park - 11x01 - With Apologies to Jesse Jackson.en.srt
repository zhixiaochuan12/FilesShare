<i>Friendly faces everywhere

<i>I'm goin out to south park

<i>Ample parking day or night

00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:24,355
<i>I'm heading out to south park

6
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:27,675
<i>I like girls with big fat titties

7
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:30,857
<i>So come on out to south park

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>Episode 11x01

00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,835
<i>And now back to, Wheel of Fortune.</i>

10
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:42,270
Allright, Randy. Congratulations on
making it all the way to the bonus round.

11
00:00:42,304 --> 00:00:45,440
Thanks, Pat.
- You got some family here watching tonight.

12
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, they're all rooting for me.

13
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:49,720
And I'm sure you have lots of friends
watching back home?

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,803
Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park.

15
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:56,740
That's us.
- Good luck!

16
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:59,100
Well let see if you can make everyone proud.

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,640
The category is:
"People who annoy you."

18
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:03,673
Okay.

19
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:08,570
As always we give you the letters,
"R", "T", "S", "L" and "E".

20
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,863
We just need three more consonants
and a vowel.

21
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,261
Okay, I'd like a "B".

22
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:16,673
A "N" and a "G".

23
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:19,500
And the vowel?
- An "O", please.

24
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,422
Okay well, looks like you're gonna
get a lot of help here.

25
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:27,421
The category is: "People who annoy you."
Audience keep quiet please.

26
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,031
Uh...

27
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,810
Well, uhm...

28
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,371
Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.

29
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:39,672
I know it, but I don't think I should say it.
- Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.

30
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,302
Allright, I'd like to solve the puzzle.

31
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:45,210
Niggers.

32
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:03,362
Oh, naggers, of course.
Naggers. Right.

33
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,743
Uh, can we cut to a...

34
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:08,203
<i>Could we cut to a-</i>

35
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,512
Well, I gave it my best shot.

36
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,281
At least we had a fup trip, huh gang?

37
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,821
I can't believe you said the "N" word
on national television.

38
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:30,070
What?

39
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:35,003
Well, what i was supposed to do, Sharon?
I thought I was gonna make $30.000!

40
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:40,091
Stanley, the only reason daddy used that word,
is that he thought he would win money!

41
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,570
Dude, did your dad know
the show was being broadcast live?

42
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:49,751
Dude, the funniest thing I've ever seen.
I watched it on YouTube about 60 times.

43
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:52,763
Can we just drop this, please?
I don't wanna talk about it.

44
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,561
Yeah, well, it's not us
you have to worry about.

45
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:57,313
It's Token.

46
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:05,931
He is gonna wanna kick your cracker teeth in.
- No, he's not. Is he?

47
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:08,401
I don't know.
- I just need to explain things.

48
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,590
Hey, Token.

49
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:15,210
Look, I don't know if you saw
Wheel of Fortune last night, but...

50
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,980
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family.

51
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,322
And then we saw all the replays
this morning on the news.

52
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:22,863
Listen, Token, my dad isn't an racist.
He's just stupid, allright?

53
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,840
He just blurted out the "N" word,
and it's no big deal, okay?

54
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,392
Uh, well, actually it is kinda a big deal, Stan.

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,791
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand
how it feels when that word comes up.

56
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,321
So don't say it isn't a big deal.

57
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:39,951
Oh, shit, here we go. It's on! Race war!

58
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,571
Race war! Race war!

59
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:47,263
Race war is on, everybody!
It's going down! Shit is going down!

60
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:50,511
Token my dad wasn't trying to be
offensive, just forget about it.

61
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,032
That's easy for you to say, Stan.
- Yeah, come on. Here we go!

62
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:55,532
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger
or anything like that.

63
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:59,152
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
- Race war, come on. Race war!

64
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:02,442
If you really think it's not a big deal,
then you really are ignorant.

65
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:05,443
That's all. I'm not fighting anybody!

66
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,660
Token forefits!

67
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:11,612
Whites win! Whites win!

68
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:15,071
Race war is over again, everybody!
Whites won again!

69
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:21,962
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely
for using the "N" word on Wheel of Fortune.

70
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:27,043
And I want to assure you that I'm not
a racist, reverend Jackson.

71
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:34,530
The puzzle you were solving was:
"People who annoy you?"

72
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,950
Well, like anybody else thought it was naggers,
I mean, right?

73
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:43,291
Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to
understand African-American culture.

74
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,491
Visit black museums, see black
performers and artists.

75
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:51,173
Oh, I will.
I'm really down with African-Americans.

76
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:56,903
Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

77
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:01,821
Very well. If you want to apologize.
I will accept.

78
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,082
Oh, thank you, Mr. Jackson.
Thank you.

79
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:08,083
Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing.
- Ready to go, sir.

80
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,971
Kiss it.
- Uh?

81
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,981
Apologize. Kiss it.

82
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:21,780
You want me to kiss your-
- That's right, apologize.

83
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:25,280
Ah, okay. I'll uh...

84
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:27,252
Let's hear uh...

85
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,071
Apologize.

86
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:40,071
Hey, Token, I just wanted to let you
know, that everything is cool now.

87
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,881
My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.

88
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,351
Oh, I see. So I'm supposed
to feel all better now?

89
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:48,443
Well, yeah.
- You just don't get it, Stan.

90
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,623
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay.

91
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:54,313
Jesse Jackson is not
the emporer of black people!

92
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:58,221
He told my dad he was.

93
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:05,231
Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk
to us about sensitivity and the power of words.

94
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:08,132
In a moment, you will meet Dr. David Nelson.

95
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,023
Who has firsthand experience
in overcoming slander,

96
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:14,302
because David is himself a little person.

97
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,772
Who knows what a little person is?

98
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:20,993
Yes, over there?
- A midget?

99
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,382
Not exactly. That term is actually
considered offensive.

100
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:28,202
And that's why Dr. Nelson goes
from school to school

101
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:31,492
getting us all to think about what we say.

102
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:37,820
He has two Ph. D.'s and has published
six books. Please welcome David Nelson!

103
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,863
Good morning, students.
How are we all feeling today?

104
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:57,400
I would like to share with you all my-

105
00:06:57,988 --> 00:07:00,870
No, dude! No, fucking way!

106
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:03,872
Dude.

107
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:09,432
That words are like bullets
and if you give-

108
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,320
Just stop, stop, stop!

109
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,262
Eric, be quiet.
- No, no, it's okay.

110
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:22,053
He will run out of steam here pretty soon.

111
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:38,772
Look, look, look!
They put a little suit on him!

112
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,380
So I said to my wife:

113
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:48,903
"You told me to kill the damn cockroach,
don't yell at me for making a mess!"

114
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:56,040
We got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how
many people here are actually from Colorado?

115
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:02,353
Got nothing better to do on a friday night
than to go to a comedy club, uh?

116
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:07,672
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

117
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:14,511
Yeah, I know you. You're the guy that
said nigger on Wheel of Fortune!

118
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:20,033
Look, everybody, it's the nigger guy.

119
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:22,752
Hey, it is him.

120
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:28,773
Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave
to the nigger guy, say "Hi, nigger guy."

121
00:08:28,827 --> 00:08:30,622
Hi, nigger guy!

122
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,150
That's allright, nigger guy,
you know we just playing.

123
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,793
Yeah. No problem.

124
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:43,553
Have y'all seen these navigation systems
in these cars, these days?

125
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:47,670
Damn things look like
they're right out of space nuts.

126
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,693
Maybe nigger guy has one,
you got one, nigger guy?

127
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:02,362
Hey, look, Patty. It's that nigger guy.

128
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,273
Nigger guy, nigger guy.

129
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:22,321
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

130
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,431
I just need some aspirin.

131
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:27,831
You aren't welcome in this store, nigger guy.

132
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,002
Fine.

133
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,880
Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned
about the behavior of one of your students.

134
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:45,833
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's
behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.

135
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:49,403
Why? I don't feel terrible.
It doesn't bother me at all.

136
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:52,533
Words are like bullets
and I let them pass right through me.

137
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:56,572
I just know that with some one-on-one
time together with this Eric Cartman.

138
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,590
I have a chance to change the way he thinks.

139
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:04,893
It might be best if you just let it go,
OK?

140
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,222
You don't understand.
You see, words are like bullets.

141
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:12,300
And if you take away the gun powder-
- Yeah, yeah, we get it, Mr. Nelson.

142
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:17,152
Very well, Mr. Nelson. Stacy,
go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.

143
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:29,950
Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about
how you respond to little people.

144
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:34,160
Did I hurt his little feelings?

145
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:38,090
You know, you think you have
the power to make me insecure.

146
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,330
But your words are actually
completely powerless.

147
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,103
We should get like eight of these. We can
dress them all up like little beavers, right?

148
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:47,243
And then put them in a pond
and see if they build a dam!

149
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:54,021
You see, no matter what you say,
I'm still standing.

150
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,501
Barely!

151
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,881
No matter how you act,
I can rise above it.

152
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:02,782
Rise above it. Get it?

153
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,762
Like he can rise above anything!

154
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:08,582
Shut your fucking mouth!
- Mr. Nelson!

155
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:15,163
He didn't get to me.
I was just joking.

156
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:21,113
Look, look how it's face gets all red.
He's like a little strawberry.

157
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,742
<i>words with venom,
words that bind.</i>

158
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:36,723
<i>words used like weapons to cloud my mind.</i>

159
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:38,873
<i>I'm a person, I'm a man</i>

160
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,282
<i>but no matter how hard I try</i>

161
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:45,420
<i>people just say:
"Hey, there goes that nigger guy."</i>

162
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:50,383
<i>everywhere I go it's always the same,
I can't get away from that terrible name.</i>

163
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,351
<i>hey, nigger guy, nigger guy, nigger guy stop!</i>

164
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:56,413
<i>now go.</i>

165
00:11:56,446 --> 00:12:00,790
<i>call me nigger guy, fill me with your hate,
try to bring me down, oh, you're to late.</i>

166
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:04,680
<i>someone just beat you to it,
but my dream will not die.</i>

167
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:09,862
<i>to be thought of as more,
than just nigger guy.</i>

168
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,791
Respect.

169
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,361
Token, hey, wait up.

170
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,623
I just wanted to say,
I get it now.

171
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,713
You know, after that little person
talked at that assembly the other day.

172
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,951
I understand how you feel about
somebody saying the "N" word.

173
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,802
So... black people are midgets?

174
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:34,260
Goddammit!

175
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:39,230
Excuse me, over here please.
I need all students to join me over here.

176
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:45,642
I've called you here because it's time that we
taught Eric Cartman a lesson, once and for all.

177
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,713
And in a few seconds Eric will be sent in,
when we walk through that door.

178
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:54,762
I want you all at the same time to yell,
"Hello, fatso."

179
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,270
I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.

180
00:12:58,308 --> 00:13:02,141
He has to learn his lesson,
you see, words are like bullets.

181
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,140
Allright, allright, here he comes.

182
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,880
Good morning fatso!

183
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:13,652
Hey, what the hell is that?
You think that's fucking funny?

184
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:18,003
Kyle, did you put everybody up to this.
I bet you did, what the hell is going on?!

185
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,951
Now you know how it feels.

186
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,692
You didn't like it when the
tables were turned, did you?

187
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,222
Allright, allright, who is the freaking genius
who dressed up it in little suspenders.

188
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,740
Clyde, was that you?

189
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:38,050
You can't to me. Words are like bullets!

190
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,153
And so it is my honor...

191
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,382
to announce today the Randy Marsh
African-American scholarship foundation.

192
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:50,022
It is my hope that this
foundation will prove...

193
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:53,721
my commitment to the education
of African-American students.

194
00:13:53,766 --> 00:14:00,432
And erase, once and for all
my identity as the nigger guy.

195
00:14:02,038 --> 00:14:03,592
You really...

196
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:06,801
you really don't know how hard it is to
be constantly reminded of something

197
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:09,051
lame that happened in your past.

198
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:14,210
I mean I... just wanna move on from what
happened on Wheel of Fortune, you know.

199
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:17,453
When people call me nigger guy...

200
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:19,862
they're bringing up a painfull
chapter of my history

201
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:22,412
and the negativity that went along with it.

202
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,600
You just, you can't imagine how that feels.

203
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,932
Is this nigger guy serious?

204
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:34,370
Anyway, here is to a new start
for us all, thank you!

205
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:44,791
Hey, look, Skeeter, that's
that guy from the tv.

206
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:49,383
Well, well, well. Looks like
we got ourselves a nigger guy.

207
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,353
Whoa !

208
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,341
Where you going, nigger guy?

209
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:10,343
Please, I don't want any trouble.
- Well, you got trouble!

210
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:15,011
When you first decided to slander an entire
race of people on Wheel of Fortune.

211
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,712
Yeah, you like making
fun of minorities, nigger guy?

212
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:21,713
We don't take kindly to social ignorance.

213
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,160
You tell him Skeeter, you tell him!

214
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:27,652
What do you want?
- What do we want?

215
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:35,431
We want to live in a world without people like
you who are intolerant of African-Americans.

216
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,820
Leave him alone.

217
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,913
Hey, that's that other nigger guy.

218
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:46,411
That's the guy from Seinfeld used
the "N" word a whole bunch of times.

219
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:50,140
Michael richards, well, son of a bitch.

220
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:55,563
Looks like it's our lucky day,
we done got us two nigger guys.

221
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,771
Make that three.

222
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,592
Mark Fuhrman.
- Who?

223
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:02,482
He done said the "N" word
in the O.J. case.

224
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,412
What is this a nigger guy convention?

225
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,933
We aren't being pushed around anymore.

226
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,001
Leave!

227
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:15,393
Come on, Skeeter, these nigger guys
ain't worth our trouble.

228
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,290
Damn nigger guys, we will be back!

229
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,302
You better come with us.

230
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,592
Come on in, Mr. Marsh, we'll make you coffee.

231
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:30,011
What's going on here?

232
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:33,100
We've been following your story
since we first saw it on the news.

233
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:35,930
Don't worry, you're with friends now.

234
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:39,030
Dale here used the "N" word
in a racial joke at work.

235
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:43,231
Scott used the plural "N" word to refer to
a group of gardeners who broke his fence.

236
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:46,561
They were Mexicans, I was being ironic.

237
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,701
We're all just like you.

238
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:52,672
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
but I'm not like you.

239
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:55,510
I just said the "N" word
by mistake to win money.

240
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,463
I made a mistake to,
I was trying to be funny!

241
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:02,381
I got frustrated and thought I
would get some shock laughs.

242
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:06,731
I'm just... not that good of an comedian
if you wanna know the real truth.

243
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,453
You said the "N" word to a black man's face.
That's way worse than what I did.

244
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:14,213
You really think that matters?

245
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,483
You really think all those people
out there see a difference?

246
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:23,651
Oh, they might see your racial slur was more
accidental, they might even laugh about it.

247
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:29,402
But at the end of the day, all you are
to them is just an another damn nigger guy.

248
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,490
Oh, you don't like that, do you?

249
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,423
No.
- Randy, we want you to join us.

250
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:41,380
We have a plan to make this all go away,
once and for all.

251
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,632
Now, look, token. I've done
everything I can to make this right.

252
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,230
You have no reason to still be mad.

253
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,752
I have every reason to be mad.
You just don't get it.

254
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,731
I'm not responsible for what my dad did.

255
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,272
No, but you can't just pretend
it never happened either.

256
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,363
What the hell do you want from me?
- Nothing.

257
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,681
Then stop being mad.
- No!

258
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:05,731
Fellas, fellas, come quick!
Cartman is gonna fight the midget!

259
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,691
Hey, come on now!

260
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:20,463
Dude, you sure you wanna do this?
Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.

261
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,091
It's a midget, dude.

262
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:26,933
Students, I am going to beat the crap
out of this kid to prove a point.

263
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:31,291
No, no, dude, it can't talk.
That isn't fair, I'll laugh to much.

264
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:51,800
Senators, I know it's not normally
considered American to ban words.

265
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:55,063
But there is one slur that's
caused so much damage...

266
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,621
that we believe it should
finally be made illegal.

267
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:03,222
I'm talking of course
about the term nigger guy.

268
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,431
Nigger-guy?

269
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:09,350
Two words which by themselves can
be harmless, but which together...

270
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,800
form a verbal missile of hate.
- Yeah, that's right.

271
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,021
Oh, sure, some people
just use the term in guest.

272
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,021
Tell a nigger guy joke or two,
thinking it's no big deal.

273
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:24,192
But they don't realise it can lead to people
using the term as an excuse for violence.

274
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:27,863
Goddamn nigger guy is trying
to be all political right now.

275
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:34,052
Senators, I've learned to admit I'm capable of
having slightly racist thoughts once in a while.

276
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,393
Can anybody say they never do?

277
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:40,571
How long will it be, before
you're all called nigger guys?

278
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,443
Hold on a second, are you suggesting
that nigger guy could become

279
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:48,013
a slur that refers to all white people?

280
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:51,561
I'm certainly not a nigger guy,
I've never thought a racist thought.

281
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,560
Oh, come on, you're the
biggest nigger guy in Washington.

282
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:57,243
Mr. Marsh, we see now the
importance of your bill.

283
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:59,511
All those in favor to ban the term nigger guy.

284
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,782
Aye.
- Opposed?

285
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:03,391
Nay.

286
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:05,883
The motion is passed!

287
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,690
Allright!
- Allright!

288
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,170
We did it!

289
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:17,823
For the first time in American history
a word has been officially banned from use.

290
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:21,510
From now on, if a person uses the word nigger

291
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:25,553
it must be atleast seven words
away from the word guy.

292
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:33,030
Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic
is over. Oh, dammit, I said it, didn't I?

293
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:40,121
Okay, okay, you win!

294
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:42,932
Say uncle!
- Uncle!

295
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:48,273
Now say, Carol Anne don't go into the light.
- Carol Anne don't go into the light.

296
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,262
Man, that is hysterical!

297
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:56,452
There, now you all see...

298
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:59,200
that I am not limited by my size!

299
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,460
I have proven my point.
My work here is done.

300
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,971
What was his point?
- I have no idea.

301
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,993
Dude, I don't get it.
- I don't get it either.

302
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:17,752
Wait a minute. That's it.
I don't get it.

303
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,580
Don't you see, Kyle?
I don't get it!

304
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:25,301
Token, I get it now.
I don't get it.

305
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:29,522
I've been trying to say that I understand
how you feel, but I'll never understand.

306
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:33,483
I'm never really get how it feels for a black
person to have somebody use the "N" word.

307
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,261
I don't get it.

308
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:39,272
Now you get it, Stan.
- Yeah, I totally don't get it.

309
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:40,403
Thanks, dude.
