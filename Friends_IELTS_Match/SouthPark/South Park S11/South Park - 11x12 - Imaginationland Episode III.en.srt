"Imaginationland Episode III"</i>

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,479
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,885
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:18,232
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

6
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:21,492
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

7
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,733
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

8
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:28,085
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

9
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:31,591
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

10
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:38,708
<i>Imaginationland used to be a happy place.</i>

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,899
<i>But then the terrorists attacked.
And so many of us were killed.</i>

12
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:50,450
<i>The Barrier came down and all the most
evil imaginary characters were unleashed.</i>

13
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,290
<i>Now our final battle will take place.</i>

14
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:58,675
<i>The evil characters are marching toward us.</i>

15
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,787
<i>With the intent to wipe us all out.</i>

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,390
This is gonna be fun, huh?

17
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:09,395
<i>We prepare for a battle we cannot win.</i>

18
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:12,612
<i>Sweet and cuddely imagninary characters,</i>

19
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:18,287
<i>many who have never held a weapon,
must now fight for their very lives.</i>

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,186
<i>We are too few in number,
but we have one hope.</i>

21
00:01:23,202 --> 00:01:29,209
That is where you come in, young boy.
Only you can help us win this battle.

22
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,082
What can I do?

23
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:35,544
You have a power here
that you have yet to understand.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode III

25
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:48,496
<i>Help!</i>

26
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,290
<i>Back it up!</i>

27
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,900
<i>Look!
Right there!</i>

28
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:55,243
<i>See that?!</i>

29
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:56,354
<i>Help!</i>

30
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:59,184
<i>What does that look like to you?!</i>

31
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,439
It's ManBearPig!

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,677
I told you it was real!
Look again!

33
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:12,346
There! half man, half bear, and half pig!
Do you see it?!

34
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:15,115
Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.

35
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:20,898
Something big is going on and the American
people need to know what! I'm off!

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,240
Washington D.C.
Memorial Hospital

37
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:30,802
He's recovering, but there's been
some trauma to his brain.

38
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,586
The boy says he's been hearing
imaginary voices.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,508
<i>Hello?</i>

40
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:40,080
<i>Hello? Anybody?</i>

41
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:42,517
Stan?

42
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:44,216
<i>Hello?</i>

43
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,168
Stan?

44
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:50,213
Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
- Cartman, what's happened?

45
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,237
What's happened?
Well, let's see:

46
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,832
You bet me that I couldn't prove
that leprechauns were real.

47
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,261
And if I could prove it,
you had to suck my balls, I believe.

48
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:01,864
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
- You just rest, Kyle.

49
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,736
Look what I made for you. A sundae.

50
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,744
It has hot fudge and whipped cream
and a cherry.

51
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:11,204
But I feel like something
is missing don't you, Kyle?

52
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:15,986
What else belongs on a sundae besides
hot fudge and whipped cream, let's see.

53
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:21,123
Hot fudge, whipped cream,
what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?

54
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:25,469
What else goes on a sundae besides
hot fudge,whipped cream, and...

55
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,814
Oh, that's right!
My balls!

56
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:31,959
Cartman, what is going on out there?!
What happened to Stan?!

57
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,627
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing
and they're gonna nuke it now.

58
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,059
So are you all set for
your big photo shoot, Kyle?

59
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,893
Wait, what do you mean?
Stan's in danger?

60
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,664
Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.

61
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:45,178
You've done a really good job of getting out
of this bet, but it's finally time to settle.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,711
Get ready for your sundae, Kyle.
With extra nuts.

63
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:54,457
Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!

64
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:57,349
Get everyone to the battlefield!
Defend the castle walls!

65
00:03:57,381 --> 00:04:00,019
Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!

66
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,629
What powers? I don't understand.
- You are real. You are a creator.

67
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:09,770
That means you can imagine things
into existence here.

68
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,119
I can?

69
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,295
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack.

70
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:18,078
The first thing we need is for you
to bring him back.

71
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:21,121
How?
- You just have to focus your mind.

72
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,265
Imagine Santa and nothing else.

73
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:25,965
How am I supposed to focus with
all this crap going on?!

74
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:29,714
Think only of one thing.
Imagine it. Believe in it.

75
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:34,269
Whatever is most prominent in your mind
will come to be.

76
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:42,230
Butters! You are grounded, mister!
You hear me?!

77
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,504
Grounded!

78
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,253
No, no, no!

79
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:51,590
What are you doing?! We need Santa!
- I'm trying!

80
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,895
Come on, kid, imagine Santa!
Believe in Santa!

81
00:04:54,927 --> 00:05:00,105
You must believe in Santa!
- Believe in Santa! Right now!

82
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,218
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that
too, okay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split.

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,980
Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying
to find out what's going on.

84
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:17,154
<i>A new terrorist attack seems to have
taken place. This time, in our imagination.</i>

85
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:20,217
<i>Al Gore brought this video to
the public's attention,</i>

86
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,790
<i> sparking demands by everyone who
wants to know exactly what's going on.</i>

87
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,936
We were hoping to keep this quiet
until it was all over,

88
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:33,100
but, two days ago there was
a terrorist attack on our imagination,

89
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:37,013
and now our imaginations are running wild.

90
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:42,376
Our imaginations are running wild
and we weren't told?!

91
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:46,415
By attacking our imagination the terrorists
have found our most vulnerable spot.

92
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,556
And we've determined that the best course
of action is to nuke our imagination.

93
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,893
Is nuking our imagination really prudent?

94
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:59,115
Aren't there other, more peaceful ways
to get our imagination under control?

95
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,877
Couldn't we trying sending
Kurt Russell into a portal

96
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,416
to our imagination to try
and reason with the-

97
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,317
We tried that! And Kurt Russell
was raped by Christmas Critters!

98
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,771
Ouch.

99
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:16,064
The Pentagon claims that because
imaginary things are not real,

100
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,207
the military doesn't need Senate
approval to nuke them.

101
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:23,293
That's bullcrap, man!
You can't nuke our imagination!

102
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,849
Don't nuke our imagination bro!

103
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,910
Mike, does the military have
the authority to nuke our imagination?

104
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,850
Clearly they don't, Steven
and they're gonna have a big problem,

105
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:38,541
because state government has already set
a precedent that imaginary characters are real.

106
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,801
I cite a famous case of Cartman v Broflovski.

107
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:45,066
In which a U.S. found for the plaintiff
who saw a leprechaun.

108
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,716
Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck
the plaintiff's balls in that case.

109
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,218
<i>That's right, Steven, yeah.</i>

110
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:51,975
Oh for the love of God!

111
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,544
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?</i>

112
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,221
Stan! Dude, is that you?

113
00:06:58,013 --> 00:07:00,965
<i>Kyle? Where are you? I don't see you.</i>

114
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:05,556
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital.
I'm hearing you in my imagination.

115
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,565
<i>Oh that makes sense.</i>

116
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,962
Dude, what's happening?

117
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,990
I'm in like a gumdrop forest.

118
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:16,530
I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up
and dead with pee in her eye.

119
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:23,011
Wait, hang on. I think something
really big is about to go down.

120
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:31,576
The evil characters are here.
- There are so many of them.

121
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,124
There's no time left! You have
to get control of your imagination,

122
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,819
and bring Santa back now!

123
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:57,637
Santa. Santa.

124
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,248
Think. Jolly old Santa.
Red suit, white beard.

125
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
Red suit, white beard. Santa!

126
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,094
How does that look? Can you see my balls
and the sundae in frame?

127
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:17,790
<i>A shocking new development in
the nuking of imagination!</i>

128
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:22,834
The Supreme Court has ruled with the military
that imaginary things are officially not real,

129
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,616
and therefore no approval is needed
to nuke them.

130
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:27,377
Thank you.
- Oh no.

131
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:31,514
This of course overturns any
imagination-based verdicts in the past,

132
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:35,614
including the famous Cartman
v Broflovski ballsucking case.

133
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:36,502
What?

134
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:39,978
So it appears the military is ready
to proceed with its operation,

135
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,191
one they are calling "Operation Nuke the
Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."

136
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,461
<i>Kyle? What's happening?</i>

137
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,650
<i>The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
- What?! You can't let them do that!</i>

138
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:55,593
<i>What am I supposed to do?
- Dude you have to stall them!</i>

139
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,371
<i>What is that? Hey!
Get out of here! Leave me alone!</i>

140
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,546
Stan?

141
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,036
Where are you going?!

142
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,401
I'm going to try to save Stan
and Butters from getting nuked!

143
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:08,652
Okay, but you you have
to suck my balls first real quick.

144
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:11,224
No, I don't! The decision was overturned.

145
00:09:11,256 --> 00:09:14,779
We had a deal, Kyle!
- Yeah, that leprechauns were real!

146
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,467
And the government just declared they
aren't technically real, so I was right!

147
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,945
It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!

148
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,390
It isn't over!

149
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,745
It isn't over, Kyle!

150
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:28,745
I have not waited this long to see
you weasel your way out of this bet!

151
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:32,645
Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life!

152
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:37,979
Before this day is over!
You, will, suck my balls!

153
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,280
I swear it!

154
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:53,100
We need more spinach for Popeye!

155
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:59,160
I got one. I got him.
- Hey there.

156
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:06,800
We're losing the battle!
There are simply too many of them!

157
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:10,725
Then the day is lost.
- Wait! Aslan, look!

158
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,924
What? What happened?
- You did it, kid!

159
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,630
Quickly Santa!
They need you on the battlefield!

160
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:22,138
Oh, all right.

161
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,275
Make way for Santa!

162
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,263
Now you see your potential, young creator.

163
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,202
But there is still much more we need
from you if we are to win this day!

164
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,597
This area is restricted,little boy.

165
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:43,861
Please, I need to talk to the people inside.
They can't set off that nuke.

166
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,258
Get behind the line with the other protesters!

167
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:50,478
No nukes in our imagination, bro!

168
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,024
You don't understand! My friend is in
Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!

169
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:59,718
You pot-smoking hippies aren't
getting through here, so back off!

170
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:04,135
Stop that nuke!
- Stop that nuke!

171
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:05,896
Stop that nuke!

172
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,341
What's going on here?

173
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:15,874
The military has to do this!
It's their only way to kill ManBearPig.

174
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:29,888
Good, Butters. Now imagine some
more archers on the castle walls!

175
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,315
Aslan! We're losing the battle!

176
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,444
We managed to fight off the vampires
and werewolves, but...

177
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,969
now our troops are being shot down
by the Cavity Creeps.

178
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,699
Cavity Creeps?

179
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:45,741
We make holes in teeth!

180
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:50,075
What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
- Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.

181
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,766
Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel!

182
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,056
Yes!

183
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:02,629
His powers are getting stronger.
We might just have a chance here.

184
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:06,909
Aslan, we've captured a spy!
He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest!

185
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,862
Stan!
Hey look, I imagined Stan here!

186
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,957
No, no! I got sucked through Operation
Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.

187
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,397
Project Imagination Doorway?

188
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:21,118
Nevermind! The battle is almost won!
We can deal with him later.

189
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,750
No, you don't understand. There's a nuke.

190
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,360
The government is about to level
this entire place.

191
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:29,784
What?
- Why would they nuke Imaginationland?

192
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,165
So the terrorists can't ever use
it against us again.

193
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:36,953
We can get Imaginationland under control.
The Chosen One just needs more time!

194
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:40,280
The Chosen One?
- Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.

195
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,252
<i>Missile launch sequence initiated.</i>

196
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:46,379
All right, people,
I want this nuking done by the books.

197
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,538
Sir, we have a security breach!
- What?!

198
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,758
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir.
It's coming from Sector Two!

199
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,499
Sector 2?

200
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,647
What the hell do you think you're doing
declaring leprechauns aren't real?!

201
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,568
What?

202
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:07,091
You just can't declare that imaginary things
aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?!

203
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:10,479
Think about it: is blue real?
Is love really real?

204
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,912
Imaginary things are things made up
by people, like Santa and Rudolph.

205
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:18,783
Yeah and they detract from real things,
like Jesus.

206
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:24,100
Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
- You'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!

207
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:29,995
It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
- So then, we're about to nuke hell...

208
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,312
That's a good thing, right?

209
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,802
Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.

210
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:37,025
What if heaven is imaginary?
We'd be nuking heaven.

211
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,573
Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
- So it'd be all right.

212
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:44,852
Look, maybe they're all part of the same
thing. Santa, Jesus, hell and leprechauns.

213
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:47,301
Maybe they're all real in the same way, right?

214
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:51,560
Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary,
but Jesus and hell are real!

215
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:54,946
Well then, what about Buddha?
- Well of course he's imaginary!

216
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:59,133
Aw, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
- Am I real?

217
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:03,721
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the
way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!

218
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:06,727
No! Leprechauns are real, Goddamnit!

219
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,652
<i>Kyle?</i>

220
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,017
<i>Kyle, what happened?</i>

221
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,767
<i>Nothing.
- What?</i>

222
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,456
Nothing happened!
There's nothing I can do!

223
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,446
<i>Dude, you can't let the government
fire off that nuke!</i>

224
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:23,664
They say they can do whatever they want
because imaginary things aren't real!

225
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,967
<i>Well you have to convince them they are real!</i>

226
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:28,709
No way, dude, then I'd have
to suck Cartman's balls.

227
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,329
<i>Whatever it takes,
you have to do it, all right?!</i>

228
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,695
<i>Hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.</i>

229
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:39,200
<i>Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
- Oh boy...</i>

230
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,346
<i>What seems to be the problem, my child?</i>

231
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:46,485
Jesus, I can't do anything. I'm just a fourth
grader going against the entire government.

232
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,011
Hello? Jesus?

233
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,806
<i>No, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.</i>

234
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:57,010
<i>Look, I know this seems like
an impossible task,</i>

235
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,299
<i>but do you remember when
I brought down the Death Star.</i>

236
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,308
<i>I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?</i>

237
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,482
Yeah, I guess.

238
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:07,669
<i>Okay, now hold on, because Superman
is here and he wants to say something.</i>

239
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:11,304
<i>Kyle, this is Superman.
- Hi Superman.</i>

240
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,187
<i> I know that saving people can
be a big responsibility,</i>

241
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:17,359
<i>but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
- I know.</i>

242
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:20,911
<i>You can do this, Kyle. Now hang on,
because Hercules wants to talk to you.</i>

243
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:21,941
Oh God.

244
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:25,585
<i>Yes, God is here too. He's gonna
talk to you right after Captain Crunch.</i>

245
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,452
Popeye, I need some help here!

246
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:37,532
Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters.

247
00:15:38,214 --> 00:15:40,008
Get off of me!

248
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,957
Hey, what is that?

249
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,535
More spinach for Popeye!

250
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,987
Imagine an M60 for Jesus!

251
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,209
All right!

252
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:59,352
The boy is doing it!
Everything is going to be okay!

253
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,234
<i>Missile launch in one minute.</i>

254
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,703
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes
are going to ruin everything!

255
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:09,595
Prepare for launch.
- Sir, we have a security breach!

256
00:16:09,611 --> 00:16:11,944
What?!
- There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert.

257
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:15,101
It's coming from Sector Two!
- Sector 2?

258
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,018
Kyle?

259
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,630
The hell are you doing back here?!
- Listen, you don't have to do this!

260
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,835
Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.

261
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:28,390
Why is it so easy for children to break
into the Pentagon?!

262
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,050
You have to stop!

263
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:33,865
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one
who bet that leprechauns weren't real.

264
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:37,166
So why do you care what happens?
- Because I...

265
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:41,490
Because I think they are real.

266
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:44,522
It's all real. Think about it.

267
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:47,590
Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus
affected your lives

268
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,273
more than most real people in this room?

269
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:52,861
I mean, whether Jesus is real or not,

270
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:55,528
he's had a bigger impact on the world
than any of us have.

271
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,607
And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny
and Superman and Harry Potter.

272
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,514
They've changed my life, changed
the way I act on the Earth.

273
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:06,054
Doesn't that make them kind of "real."

274
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:10,921
They might be imaginary, but they're
more important than most of us here.

275
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,970
And they're all gonna be around
long after we're dead.

276
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,748
So in a way, those things are
more realer than any of us.

277
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:31,115
Abort the sequence.

278
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:42,237
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh?
Guess that means I did win the bet after all.

279
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,884
And you know what that means, Kyle.

280
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,021
Just let it go with your fucking balls,
you fucking asshole!

281
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,903
Your friends have been in danger
and all you care about it this stupid bet!

282
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,093
Well I've decided, Cartman,
even if we had a bet,

283
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,529
that I am never sucking your balls,
you got that?!

284
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,355
They can throw me in jail for
the rest of my life,

285
00:17:56,356 --> 00:18:00,094
but I am never going to suck
your balls, never! So there!

286
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,838
What happened?!
Why hasn't the missile gone off?!

287
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:07,165
There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
- No! ManBearPig has to die!

288
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:08,752
Oh Jesus no!

289
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:27,310
That's it, Aslan!
The evil characters have fled!

290
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,104
The day is ours!

291
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,505
Kyle!
- Fellas! Where'd you come from?

292
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:41,378
What is that?

293
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,329
He did it!

294
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:33,808
Oh look, I'm back!

295
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,366
Nice going, kid.

296
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:41,679
The evil characters!
They're all behind the wall again.

297
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:46,629
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
- Well I just used my imagination.

298
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:51,662
You know, I really have learned a lot,
you guys.

299
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:55,964
What Kyle said about imaginary things
being real and Butters using his imagination?

300
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,144
It makes me think that well maybe we all
have the power to make things a reality.

301
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:06,883
Oh why look, it's me.
And...

302
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:12,175
And there's Kyle.
And what's Kyle about to do?

303
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,496
Cartman, don't!

304
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:20,714
Oh Kyle! What are you doing to my balls?
Oh, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls!

305
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,793
Dude.
- Oh my God.

306
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,380
Oh Kyle, you are gobbling those balls,
aren't you?

307
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:28,586
I told you you would suck my balls
before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?

308
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:31,795
I'm not sucking your balls, that's imaginary!

309
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:35,135
No, Kyle, I believe you said
that imaginary things are real.

310
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,800
That's true. You did.

311
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:41,302
Oh, look at you go, Kyle!
Oh, you dirty girl! You love those balls.

312
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,413
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking.
We need to get you boys home.

313
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:52,697
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
- Whatever you imagine to be real, is real.

314
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,912
Butters? Butters!

315
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,214
What?

316
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:04,336
It was all just a dream.

317
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:08,526
Come on, Butters, time to get up.
- Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream!

318
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:12,495
I saved all of Imaginationland from
running wild after a terrorist attack!

319
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:16,024
You were in Imaginationland, Butters!
We've read all about it in the paper!

320
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,548
The question is,
what were you doing in Imaginationland

321
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:21,244
when you were supposed to be helping
your mother clean up the basement?!

322
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,593
You are grounded, mister!

323
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,632
Wait, I'm not grounded.
- Oh yes you are!

324
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:31,235
Oh yeah?

325
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,931
