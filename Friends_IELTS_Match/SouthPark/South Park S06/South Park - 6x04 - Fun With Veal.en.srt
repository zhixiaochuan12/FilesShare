14
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,467
Okay, children, step off
the bus and form a group

15
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:39,133
Next to the
nice redneck.

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,098
I mean, rancher.

17
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,567
Hello, boys and girls,
my name is rancher bob.

18
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:44,184
Let's all say hello
to rancher bob.

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,732
Hi, rancher bob.

20
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:48,434
I'm pleased to show you all
the wonderful world of beef.

21
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,032
Follow me.

22
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,300
City kids get to go to
museums for field trips.

23
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,499
We get cow farms.

24
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,165
Now, out here you can
see our cattle.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,367
This is where the magic begins
as the cows eat, sleep

26
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:01,667
And prepare for
certain death.

27
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,566
They look
so delicious.

28
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,732
And here we have
the slaughterhouse.

29
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:09,200
This is where we turn the cows
into steaks and burgers!

30
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,534
Ewww!
Ewww!

31
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:11,799
Aw, dude!

32
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:13,200
Anybody want
a free sample?

33
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,599
Me me me me!

34
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:18,200
And in here, boys and girls,
we have our veal ranch.

35
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,766
You see, with veal,

36
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,566
The whole key is keeping
the cows chained

37
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:31,968
So they can't walk around
or get any exercise.

38
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,300
That way, their muscle
tissue stays soft,

39
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,751
And makes for
tender veal.

40
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:39,167
Wait a minute,
veal is...

41
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:40,434
Little baby cows?

42
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,833
Yepper!

43
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,301
Then why the hell do
they call it "veal"?

44
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,734
Well, if we called it
"little baby cow"

45
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:45,635
People might not
eat it.

46
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,501
Yeah!
I wouldn't have!

47
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,165
Me neither.

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,334
Oh man,
look at that one!

49
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,234
He looks delicious!

50
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,265
What?

51
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,466
Mmm, succulent
and juicy...

52
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,367
Can we have a free
sample of these too?

53
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,234
Well, no, but all these
veals are going to

54
00:01:57,269 --> 00:01:58,618
The slaughterhouse
tomorrow morning.

55
00:01:58,653 --> 00:01:59,933
They'll be steaks
by the afternoon,

56
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,834
And then you can buy them
at your grocery store.

57
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:02,899
All right!

58
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:03,501
Tomorrow morning?

59
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,267
Dude, we gotta
help them.

60
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:10,701
Yeah.

61
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,899
Psst-
Cartman.

62
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,417
No, uncle jessie, no!

63
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:20,901
Cartman, wake up!

64
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:21,699
What?

65
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,067
What the hell are
you guys doing?

66
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,100
Come on,
we gotta go!

67
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:25,098
Where we going?

68
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,868
We're gonna go save the
little baby cows, fat-Ass.

69
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:27,732
What, why?

70
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,234
They're gonna get
slaughtered, butthole!

71
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,265
So?

72
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,450
So we can't let 'em die,
douche bag.

73
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,742
You're our friend,
now come help us.

74
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,965
Well, let's see,
in the last 3.2 seconds

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,233
You've called me fat-Ass,
butthole, and douche bag.

76
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:38,467
I really don't feel much
like your guys' friend.

77
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,065
We're sorry,
you are our friend.

78
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,400
We need you to help us because
friends stick together.

79
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,851
Wait, i thought you said we
needed him because he has

80
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:47,267
Impossible
breaking and entering playset"?

81
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:48,200
Dammit, butters,
will you shut up?

82
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,399
Oh ho!

83
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,317
So you need me and my
impossible

84
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:52,200
Breaking and
entering playset.

85
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,399
Yes, we do.

86
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:55,167
We're those little
baby cows' only hope.

87
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:56,968
Will you help us?

88
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:58,699
Yes, yes, i will.

89
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,734
If kyle will kiss
my black ass.

90
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,766
What?

91
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,133
Just give it a little kiss
and i'll help.

92
00:03:03,168 --> 00:03:04,199
Screw you, cartman!

93
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,332
Okay, but if you
want my help

94
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,234
You have to give it
just a little kiss.

95
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,199
Kiss it.

96
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:09,234
Go on, dude,
it's the only way.

97
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,232
No!

98
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:11,365
Kiss it.
Come on, kiss it!

99
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,267
Just do it really fast
and we can go.

100
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:13,734
Have butters kiss it!

101
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,167
No, it has to
be kyle.

102
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,033
Ohhh!

103
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,783
Oh man, that was
so awesome!

104
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,265
Sick, i felt it
on my face!

105
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,467
Okay, very funny, cartman,
now come on.

106
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:30,033
Hey, i'm not
going with you.

107
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:31,667
Yaaa!

108
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,332
I don't know
about this, fellas,

109
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,000
It says right on the
impossible

110
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:39,599
Breaking and entering
playset:

111
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,333
"Not for actual
breaking and entering.

112
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,998
Breaking and entering
is a crime."

113
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,701
Yeah, well, killing little
helpless baby cows

114
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:46,866
Should be a crime too.

115
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,150
How does this thing
work, cartman?

116
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,409
Jesus, don't you guys
have any toys?

117
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:50,599
First you put on
the black ski mask.

118
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,968
Then use the torch to
cut a hole in the roof.

119
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,467
Okay, that's far enough,
i'm going to go delta.

120
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:06,632
You have to talk louder,

121
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,732
I forgot the
double-A batteries

122
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,200
For the super talk
playaction headset.

123
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,434
I said that's
far enough!

124
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,868
Don't be scared,
little baby cow,

125
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,818
We're here to
set you loose.

126
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,734
There you go,
you're free!

127
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,466
Run away!

128
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,350
Go, they're gonna
murder you!

129
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:26,009
Stan, could you
hurry it up?

130
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:27,599
I'm freezing
my ass off.

131
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,667
You need to freeze
some of your ass off.

132
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,033
Oh, at least i have
an ass, jew!

133
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,866
What?

134
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:36,267
Come on, you stupid
baby cows!

135
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:39,634
You have to get
out of here!

136
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,101
What's the matter?

137
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:42,499
They aren't leaving!

138
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:44,901
See? Maybe they want to become
sweet, juicy veal steaks.

139
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,200
Hey, they've never been
allowed to walk before.

140
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,265
They just don't know how!

141
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
Oh yeah, they're
too weak to move.

142
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,284
We've got to get them
out of here.

143
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,493
We'll just keep them
at butters' house

144
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:54,667
Until they can get
their strength back.

145
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,399
No, no, no, no, no!

146
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:57,200
I can't bring calves
into my house,

147
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:58,817
I'll get grounded.

148
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,365
Okay, fine, butters,

149
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,617
I guess you're not
a team player.

150
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:02,799
We'll bring them
to my house.

151
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,767
Dude, how are we gonna move
23 calves to your house?

152
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:05,718
I don't know.

153
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:06,599
I've got it!

154
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,732
We could kill butters,

155
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,367
And then float the calves
on a river of blood.

156
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,799
Don't be stupid,
cartman!

157
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:11,534
Butters doesn't have
that much blood in him.

158
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,866
Yeah, i do, too!

159
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,567
We're just gonna have to
carry them one by one.

160
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:17,300
Come on you, guys!

161
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:19,033
Ehh!

162
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,901
Check it out, you guys,
i'm calf curling.

163
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,467
Man, these calves
smell like crap.

164
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,067
I don't see how you're
gonna hide them

165
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:37,534
From your mom
much longer.

166
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,365
We won't have to.

167
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,601
Butters said he had
something at his house

168
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:41,567
That makes baby cows
strong again.

169
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,632
He's bringing it over.

170
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,100
Butters had that
at his house?

171
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:44,732
Hey, fellas!

172
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,267
Butters,
did you bring it?

173
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,699
I sure did!

174
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:49,367
We'll have those poor baby
cows in shape in no time!

175
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:50,466
All right!

176
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,767
"Suzanne sommers
calf exerciser."

177
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:53,766
What?

178
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,234
"Makes your calves stronger
in just two days."

179
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,434
Oh, goddammit!
That's your plan?

180
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,666
You think
it's a gimmick?

181
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,734
Suzanne promises right on
the box that it works.

182
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,499
Hello, mrs. Marsh!

183
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,400
Officer barbrady,
what can i do for you?

184
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,899
Well, we've got
a little problem.

185
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,100
Jed here caught your
boy and his friends

186
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:13,566
Trespassing on his ranch.

187
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,200
They stole some
of his property.

188
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,065
Stole?
Are you sure?

189
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,217
I followed
a calf curling trail

190
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,826
Right to your
house, ma'am.

191
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,281
Ooh, stan's
in trouble!

192
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,666
Let me kick
his ass, mom!

193
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,998
Now, now,
my son is not a thief.

194
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:27,734
I'm sure this is just some
kind of misunderstanding.

195
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,400
Stanly, did you see-

196
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,899
Oh, crap!

197
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,234
Stanly, what are you doing
with those calves?

198
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,267
That asshole was
gonna kill them

199
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:38,384
And feed them
to people!

200
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,943
Stanly, they
belong to him.

201
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,432
They don't belong
to anybody!

202
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,901
Please, mom, we don't want
these cows to die!

203
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:43,766
Let me hit him, mom!

204
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,399
Stanly, this isn't up
for discussion.

205
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:46,801
The rancher is going to
take his cows back

206
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:49,133
And you don't
have a choice.

207
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,332
Stanly!

208
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,100
Stanly, you open
this door right now

209
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:58,367
Or you're gonna
get it!

210
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,365
No!

211
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Stan, you're behaving
like a kid.

212
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:02,834
You're the ones who
made me eat veal

213
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:03,998
Without telling me
what it was!

214
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,567
You're the ones who
knew we were making

215
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,067
Little baby
animals suffer!

216
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:07,501
Open this door, now!

217
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:08,998
Kiss my ass!

218
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,566
Oh, jeez, he said "ass"
to his parents.

219
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,065
You're getting in
pretty deep, dude.

220
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,734
I apologize for this,
mr. Rancher person.

221
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,567
Well, why don't you
just tell them

222
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:18,732
That the cows
will be safe?

223
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,400
And when they come out
i can take them back.

224
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,618
I can't lie
to my son, okay?

225
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:22,766
If i betrayed him
like that,

226
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,267
I'd pay for it
the rest of my life.

227
00:07:24,302 --> 00:07:25,532
Well, that's just
too bad!

228
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,601
Look, that's $800's
worth of veal up there

229
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:28,933
And i have to
ship out friday!

230
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,934
What are you going to do,
officer barbrady?

231
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,300
Me? How'd i get
into this mess?

232
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,965
So what happens now?

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,666
I'm gonna lock myself
in here with these cows

234
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,567
Until we have a guarantee of
their safety, in writing.

235
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,200
We're with you, dude.
Yeah!

236
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,232
Don't be so sure.

237
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,699
Because i'm gonna
tell you-

238
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:45,032
This is gonna get ugly,
real ugly.

239
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,517
When all is said and done
you could all be looking at

240
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,909
Being grounded for three,
perhaps even four weeks.

241
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:52,267
So if any of you guys want out,
just say the word now.

242
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,199
I want out.

243
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,200
Shut up, cartman.

244
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,132
We're with you, stan.

245
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,234
Yeah, we can't let those
little baby cows down.

246
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,000
They've got no one else
to turn to.

247
00:07:59,035 --> 00:07:59,998
Then it's settled.

248
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,701
One for all and
all for one, except cartman!

249
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:02,467
Yeah!Yeah!
Yeah!

250
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:03,434
Wait, what?

251
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:08,699
And so that's
the situation.

252
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:09,965
Our boys have locked
themselves in stan's room

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,300
Until we can promise them
the calves will live free,

254
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:13,232
In writing.

255
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,432
Well, this is
ridiculous.

256
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:15,699
<i>I don't know how you
raise your kids,</i>

257
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,933
But my son does not play
negotiator with me!

258
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, excuse me, sheila,
but it wasn't that simple.

259
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:23,084
Ha! Give me
15 seconds with kyle,

260
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,493
And i'll have
that door open.

261
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,833
Kyle, this is
your mother!

262
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,868
You will open this door
right now!

263
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,532
No i won't.

264
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:33,834
Yes, i see what
you mean, sheila,

265
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:34,965
That was very
impressive.

266
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,567
Kyle, if you don't do
what you're told,

267
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:38,084
I'm going to
be very angry!

268
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,532
Well, you made me
eat veal

269
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,833
And didn't tell me
what it was!

270
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,300
So go ahead and be angry,
you baby-Cow-Killing bitch!

271
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,267
Very persuasive.

272
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,199
Ahhh!

273
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,701
Open this door!
Open this door!

274
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,267
Ho, ho-
Let me try.

275
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,299
Butters?

276
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,367
Butters, this is
your father.

277
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,584
Oh, sweet jesus!

278
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,732
What do i do?

279
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,300
Be strong, butters, you knew
it would come to this.

280
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,734
Butters, answer me!

281
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,098
But dad's angry
at me.

282
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,501
Don't panic, i'll
tell you what to say.

283
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,199
Butters, right now!

284
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,400
Dad, uh, why don't you
suck my fat one.

285
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,466
What?!

286
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,432
Oh, sweet jesus.

287
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,632
What's gotten
into them?

288
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,501
All right, stanly, this
has gone on long enough.

289
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:11,901
Your little game
is over!

290
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:13,232
This isn't a game, mom.

291
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,534
We're not coming out until we
know the calves will be safe.

292
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,467
Well, that's fine, you boys
can just stay in there

293
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:18,699
And starve to death.

294
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,900
<i>Us parents are going to
go to pizza shack</i>

295
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,067
And eat pepperoni pizzas
and ice cream.

296
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:23,965
Oh, god dammit,
you guys.

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,766
Cartman, stay away
from that door!

298
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,199
You'll have to come out
sooner or later, boys,

299
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,200
The longer you wait, the more
trouble you'll be in.

300
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:34,466
Aagh!

301
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,799
Round one is over,
we made it.

302
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,367
We didn't make it, your
mom is right, douche bag,

303
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:39,866
What are we gonna do, stay
in here until we starve?

304
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:42,067
Our parents would never let us
starve, they're bluffing.

305
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:43,299
This is a battle
of wills.

306
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,300
If we hold out long enough
they'll give in.

307
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,566
But we will have to
sleep, dude.

308
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,033
Three of us can sleep
while one keeps watch.

309
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,632
We'll shift every
couple of hours.

310
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,100
Hey, this is gonna be just
like vietnam, huh, fellas?

311
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:52,998
Whoopie!

312
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,667
We'll stay in this room
with these baby cows

313
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,234
For as long
as it takes!

314
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,866
Well, we tried
everything.

315
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,234
We can't get through the door
without tearing apart the house.

316
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,001
Dear god, it's been
over 13 hours.

317
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,734
Ooh, but my poor
little poopsie

318
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,265
Must be getting
so hungry.

319
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,050
Maybe we should get them
a little food.

320
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:16,766
Miss cartman,
this is a battle of will.

321
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,400
We need our boys to know that
we're not gonna cave in, at all.

322
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:20,766
Oh, all right.

323
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,033
Let's all just go to bed and
let them play their little game

324
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,151
For as long as they can.

325
00:10:25,186 --> 00:10:27,234
Good night,
fellas!

326
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,632
Good night.

327
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,533
Good night, patches.
Good night, halloway.

328
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,400
Good night, neptune.
Good night, davis.

329
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:33,732
Good night, bud.

330
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,367
Good night, red.
Good night, paulette.

331
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,766
Good night, chastity.

332
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:40,033
Butters, i'm going to kill you
over and over again.

333
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,766
Can't go on...
need food...

334
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,367
I didn't realize hunger
made you feel so bad.

335
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,567
There's only one
alternative, you guys,

336
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:54,532
We're gonna have to
eat a calf.

337
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,699
No, cartman,
we're not eating a calf.

338
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:58,767
All right! Then we're gonna
have to eat butters.

339
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,501
He might be
right, dude.

340
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,098
Aw, heck.

341
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,167
Wait, what is that?

342
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,265
Dude! Food!

343
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,965
Miss cartman,
what are you doing?

344
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,601
Ooh, i just can't stand
to see my baby suffer.

345
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,901
Oh dear god, you've
ruined everything!

346
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:13,732
All right!

347
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,567
See, now we can
hold out for weeks!

348
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:16,867
Look, you guys,
beef jerky!

349
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:18,133
Yeah!
And fried chicken!

350
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:20,132
Wha-?

351
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,232
Mmm!
Mmm!

352
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,501
Dude, what are
you guys doing?

353
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:23,752
We're eating, dude.

354
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:24,933
You're eating meat!

355
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,868
What the hell do you guys think
we're doing all this for?

356
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,651
Hey, i'm doing it to
save little baby cows.

357
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm not gonna stop eating
meat all together.

358
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:31,566
Me neither.

359
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:32,701
Yeah, if you don't
eat meat at all

360
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:33,866
You become a pussy.

361
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,567
That's fine, you guys
can live off of flesh,

362
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:36,918
But i'm never eating
meat again.

363
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,110
Go ahead,
that's more for us.

364
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:39,267
You want some
beef jerky, buddy?

365
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,232
Yes, who's your buddy?

366
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,000
Who's hungry?
Who's a hungry man?

367
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,200
Dude,
that's messed up.

368
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:52,998
You guys,
check this out!

369
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,234
Tom, i'm standing in front
of the house

370
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,599
Where three insane
boy-Terrorists

371
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,534
Have barricaded themselves
inside a room

372
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,001
With 23 live
infant cattle.

373
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:03,399
Hey, look,
some other kids

374
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,799
Are doing the
same thing we are!

375
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,534
Several attempts to
break into the room

376
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,018
Have proven
unsuccessful, tom,

377
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,143
And the crisis
is intensifying.

378
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,234
Here's what some people
had to say.

379
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,332
We were just sleeping

380
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,800
When suddenly we heard
all the commotion.

381
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,234
I mean, to think this
could happen right here

382
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,799
In our own community.

383
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,666
We gave those kids
everything,

384
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,400
And they've turned into
little john walkers.

385
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:25,833
The police chief of
south park says

386
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:28,534
That there will be no
negotiations with terrorists.

387
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,801
Oh, no, this is big-Time
trouble now, fellas.

388
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,434
No, this is exactly
what we wanted.

389
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,933
It is?
Yes, don't you see?

390
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:36,100
This validates everything
that we're doing.

391
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:36,965
If we're making the news

392
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,534
Then this is obviously
important to people.

393
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:39,666
Tom, it looks like
i have an update.

394
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,267
Yes, it looks like
the boy-Terrorist story

395
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:44,334
Is not interesting news
to anyone.

396
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:46,332
Uh, nothing else
was going on, tom,

397
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,934
<i>So this was the only story we
had to make seem important,</i>

398
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,766
But people are just
simply tuning out.

399
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,833
<i>So, hbc will now be
switching programming</i>

400
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:56,334
Once again to "puppies
from around the world!"

401
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,833
I don't believe it.

402
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,501
The chinese puppy is
my favorite so far!

403
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,933
Butters?

404
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:28,884
Butters, you have
your arm around me!

405
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,766
Oh sorry, i thought
you were mr. Pickles.

406
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,751
* we must help the helpless *

407
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:34,701
* we must save
the unsaved... *

408
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,165
What the hell is that?

409
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,866
* for if we
fight together *

410
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,601
* we can make sure
the road is paved *

411
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,200
* for a brighter
tomorrow... *

412
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:43,132
Hippies!

413
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,367
What are they
doing here?

414
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,532
We're with you, boys!

415
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:47,934
Your message is real
and your fight is just!

416
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,265
Yeah!
Hooray!

417
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,334
Dude, those gaywads
are on our side?

418
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,668
Eww,
they're all dirty.

419
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:53,933
What did i
tell you, stan?

420
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,833
We saved some baby cows
from being eaten

421
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,267
And now we're no good dirty
goddamn hippies!

422
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,234
Tom, the calf terrorist
standoff continues

423
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,234
As now members
of the f.B.I. Arrive

424
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:06,601
To put an end
to the conflict.

425
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:08,232
Oh, jesus christ.

426
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,499
Who's in charge here?

427
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,534
I am- But i
don't want to be.

428
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:12,833
Where's the negotiator?

429
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,100
Right here- Glen dumont,
negotiator squad.

430
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,367
All right, see
what you can do.

431
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,666
Dude, are you okay?

432
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,699
Oh, i just feel
so run down.

433
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,133
I don't know what's
wrong with me,

434
00:14:22,168 --> 00:14:23,267
I've got these sores.

435
00:14:23,302 --> 00:14:24,399
What is that?

436
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:25,634
Dude, maybe we should
end this.

437
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:26,632
No!

438
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,567
Get me a hard line to
the phone in that house.

439
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,232
The terrorists
already said

440
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,817
There's no way
they're coming out.

441
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,332
Don't worry,
i'm a negotiator,

442
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,934
It's my job to talk to
freaks like this

443
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,501
And bring about
a peaceful resolution

444
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:37,267
Using clever psychology.

445
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:39,833
Hello?

446
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:42,534
Hello, my name is mike,
i'm a negotiator.

447
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,200
Is it okay
if i talk to you?

448
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,165
Uh, hold on.

449
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,501
It's some negotiator named
mike, what do i do?

450
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,601
Don't give him anything!

451
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,566
What do i say?

452
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,199
Ah, gimme that.
Talk to me, mike.

453
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:52,667
I'm here to make sure we can
all end this peacefully.

454
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:54,100
You want that, right?

455
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,199
Sure, sure.

456
00:14:55,234 --> 00:14:56,599
How about we make a trade,

457
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,267
Just to show that we can
trust each other.

458
00:14:58,302 --> 00:14:59,566
What'd you have
in mind?

459
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,867
Well, how about you send out
one of the calves?

460
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,133
Oh, mike, you're breaking
my balls here, mike.

461
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,534
Just one,
that's all we want.

462
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,866
All right,
how about this?

463
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,701
You guys have all the leverage
and we have nothing.

464
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:10,367
So how about we
give you one calf-

465
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:11,632
Cartman, no!
Dude!

466
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,234
We'll give you one calf
if you'll give us

467
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,033
Some guns and ammunition
of our own.

468
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,032
What?
I can't do that!

469
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,284
Oh, i'm sorry, i thought
we were talking here,

470
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,501
But i guess you're not
talking to me, good-Bye.

471
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:21,432
No, no, wait!
I'm sorry, i'm sorry.

472
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,650
You're right, what reason
do you have to trust me?

473
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,834
I'm just a guy from lakewood
trying to make ends meet.

474
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,732
Just a blue collar guy
like your dad.

475
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,883
Don't have a dad, mike,
that's not gonna work.

476
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, all right, some guns,
i'll see what i can do.

477
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,599
Okay, up a little...

478
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:38,834
Left a little...
almost there.

479
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:39,866
What is that?

480
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:40,667
We're giving the boys
some guns

481
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,267
In return for a calf.

482
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:43,332
What?

483
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,632
You're giving
my baby guns?

484
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,333
Hey, this is a negotiation
process, okay?

485
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:48,000
Did you people go to
negotiators' school?

486
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,399
No, you didn't!

487
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:50,300
Get 'im on
the line for me.

488
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,732
Hello?

489
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,734
Okay, you see that?
I keep my end of the bargain.

490
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:55,868
All right,
we'll keep ours.

491
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,933
We'll send out one calf.

492
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,267
Well, how about you
send out two calves?

493
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,699
Oh, jesus!

494
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,467
Y'know, there's just no
talking to you, is there, mike?

495
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:04,951
We had a deal.
Do you think i'm stupid?

496
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,400
Don't treat me like
i'm stupid here!

497
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,534
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

498
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:08,599
Dammit, i'm losing them!

499
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,100
Okay, i'm sorry,
just send out one calf.

500
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,899
Oh, no, no, no-

501
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,400
Now you're gonna have to
get us something else.

502
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:14,400
What'd you have in mind?

503
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,466
A little to the left.

504
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:21,601
Okay, that's good.
A little to the right.

505
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:23,168
You're giving them
a missile?!

506
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,666
Stand down, ma'am,
stand down!

507
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:27,133
This is a delicate process,
i've almost earned their trust.

508
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,067
Stan's getting
worse, you guys.

509
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:31,517
Mike, babe.

510
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:32,766
How we doing?

511
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,017
We got a real sick
kid here, mike,

512
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,234
Did you get the other
things for us?

513
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,766
I did manage
to get the f.D.A.

514
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:38,934
To officially change
the word "veal"

515
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,133
To "tortured baby cow".

516
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:41,332
Good, good.

517
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,367
But i couldn't get you
north and south dakota.

518
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,566
Oh, mike, breaking
my balls, mike.

519
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,767
Now, please, can we
get you to come out?

520
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,434
All right, everything
has worked out.

521
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,968
The boys have promised
to come out

522
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:55,467
And bring the cows out
with them.

523
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:56,666
All right!
Woo-Hoo!

524
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,601
I'm sorry i doubted your
abilities, mr. Negotiator.

525
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:00,532
They're
coming out now?

526
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,566
Yes, all we need
to do in return

527
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,251
Is get a cattle-Transporting
semi truck

528
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,901
That will take the boys
and the cattle

529
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:06,998
To denver
international airport

530
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,601
Where we will have a
fully-Gassed airplane

531
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,067
Waiting to take them
all to mexico.

532
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:11,265
What?

533
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
And they want the guy that
plays "mr. Worf" on "star trek"

534
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,534
To drive the truck...
in full makeup.

535
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,732
Jesus christ!

536
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,199
All right,
that does it!

537
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,300
You are, in fact,
the worst negotiator

538
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:21,833
I have ever seen
in action!

539
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,300
All right, all right,
i'll give you that.

540
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,567
But in return i want
three staples.

541
00:17:25,602 --> 00:17:26,299
Get out of here!

542
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,098
We'll get them the semi,

543
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,467
And we'll get them the
worf guy from star trek.

544
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:31,534
If they see that,
then they'll come out

545
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:33,051
And then,
we can take them.

546
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,499
But isn't that
dishonest?

547
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,801
Maybe so, but if we don't
do something soon

548
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,699
There could be 50,
even 60 people

549
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,950
Who have to go without
veal for dinner.

550
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,167
Are you prepared
to let that happen?

551
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,599
All right,
where is mr. Dorn?

552
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,165
I was woken up
at three in morning,

553
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,534
Told i had to put on makeup
and come to this town.

554
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:55,899
What the hell
is going on?

555
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,599
I'm sorry, mr. Dorn,
it's f.B.I. Business.

556
00:17:57,634 --> 00:17:59,267
We've got terrorists making
demands and we need your help.

557
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,699
This is highly unusual.

558
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,199
All right, boys,
we have your truck.

559
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,968
And we have an airplane on the
tarmac at denver international.

560
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:06,599
And worf?

561
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,265
My name is
michael dorn,

562
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,267
I play a character
called worf.

563
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:11,200
Stan, it worked!

564
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:12,532
It... did?

565
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,434
They got us a truck and an
airplane and mr. Worf!

566
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,568
The calves are gonna be okay!

567
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,667
Pick me up, i...
i want to see.

568
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
Step back, tell those men
to step back!

569
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:28,200
Do it!

570
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,365
All right!

571
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,901
Ah, shut up,
ya friggin' hippies!

572
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,532
All right, mr. Worf,

573
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,466
Start the engine
and put her in gear.

574
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,033
Oh, and you must refer
to me as "captain".

575
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,334
Where am i supposed
to drive to?

576
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,432
No, see, you must say,

577
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,733
"Captain, where am i
supposed to drive to?"

578
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,965
Captain, where am i
supposed to drive to?

579
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,901
You're going to back the truck
up to the door of the house

580
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:52,400
So we can safely
load in the calves.

581
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,466
This whole thing
is ridiculous.

582
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:56,267
"Captain, this whole
thing is ridiculous."

583
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,033
Captain, this whole
thing is ridiculous.

584
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,265
Okay, all set!

585
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,699
Tom, it looks as though
the terrorists

586
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:07,067
Are now loading the baby cows
into the back of a semi!

587
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:11,033
This is still very
uninteresting news, tom.

588
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,232
Okay, cartman!

589
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,334
Step on it,
mr. Worf!

590
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:15,368
All right!

591
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:16,332
We're going!

592
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,400
Mexico, here we come!

593
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,501
Wait a minute,
they're following us!

594
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:25,699
Full speed, mr. Worf!

595
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,265
We cannot keep going fast
on these icy roads!

596
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,100
"Captain, we cannot keep going
fast on these icy roads."

597
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:33,901
Captain, we cannot keep going
fast on these icy roads.

598
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:35,065
Alright, mr. Worf,
then reduce speed to 45

599
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,834
But maintain distance from
those police cruisers.

600
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,918
Stan, we're
almost there.

601
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:41,933
You've got to hold on.

602
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,801
All right, they're in front
of the cattle ranch.

603
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:45,801
Hit it!

604
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:52,399
Oh, it's a double-Cross!

605
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,299
All right, boys,
the game is over.

606
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,234
Get out of the truck
with your hands up.

607
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,933
Oh, no, no!

608
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,801
What are you waiting for?
Go kill them, worf!

609
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,466
I'm not killing
anybody!

610
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,567
Some goddamn
klingon you are.

611
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:09,967
We're sorry, cows.

612
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,334
We tried...
we tried.

613
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:12,766
All right, boys,

614
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:14,434
Just stay right there
until your parents arrive.

615
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:15,199
Can i go now?

616
00:20:15,234 --> 00:20:17,299
Here you go,
mr. Rancher,

617
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,334
I got your cattle
back for you!

618
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:21,334
Oh... well, it
doesn't matter now.

619
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,632
What do you mean?

620
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,998
You see, in the six days
since the word "veal"

621
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,534
Was officially changed to
"little tortured baby cow",

622
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,699
The market has gone dry.

623
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,867
Seems when people see
"little tortured baby cow"

624
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,000
On their menus, they don't
feel like ordering.

625
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:32,799
Really?

626
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,399
Yup, damn things
ain't worth spit now.

627
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,167
I'll let 'em live outside
with the other cows

628
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,332
And live a normal life.

629
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,100
You hear that, stan?
It worked!

630
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,834
We've shut down
the veal industry!

631
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,767
Stan, stan?

632
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,933
He's very lucky you got
him here when you did.

633
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,033
He was in a very advanced
state of "vaginitis".

634
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:50,399
Vaginitis?

635
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,299
It occurs when a person
stops eating meat.

636
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,968
Those sores on his skin were
actually small vaginas.

637
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:55,998
If we hadn't
stopped it in time,

638
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:58,200
Stand would have
eventually just become

639
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:00,267
One great big,
giant pussy.

640
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,466
Whoa, dude.

641
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:02,766
We've got an i.V.
Of pure beef blood

642
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,467
Pumping into stan's veins,
and the sores are fading.

643
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:06,933
Thank god we
stopped it in time.

644
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,833
Well, i guess we learned
something today.

645
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,167
It's wrong to eat veal because the
animals are so horribly mistreated,

646
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,834
But if you don't eat meat at all
you break out in vaginas.

647
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:14,766
Hear, hear.

648
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,432
All right, boys,
it's time to go home.

649
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,467
You've got some serious
grounding time to start.

650
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:19,699
I'll say!

651
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:20,933
Aw, we're still
grounded?

652
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:23,167
But, but we learned things
and took up a cause.

653
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:25,367
Yes, kyle, but you still
defied your parents.

654
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,100
And you need to learn
that terrorism

655
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:28,699
Is never the answer.

656
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,968
That's right, let's get these
terrorists to their rooms.

657
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:33,567
But first- Maybe we can
grab some burgers.

658
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:35,200
All right!
All right!
