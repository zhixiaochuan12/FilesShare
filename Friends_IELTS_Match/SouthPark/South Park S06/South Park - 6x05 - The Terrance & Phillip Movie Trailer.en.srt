00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,800
As we travel all around

37
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,934
Hey! What the hell do you

00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,701
You walked right through

00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:37,601
Oh, excuse me,

00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,617

00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,793
Shut up, turd,

00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:47,934
No, shelly,

46
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,268
Agh!

00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:50,532

00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:51,800

00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:52,998
The russell crowe

50
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,666
You turds don't even
like that show!

51
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,265
It's not the show
we care about.

52
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,933
During one of the commercial
breaks of tonight's episode

53
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,434
They're gonna show the exclusive,
never- Before-Seen trailer

54
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:02,001
To the new terrance
and phillip movie!

55
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:03,534
It's the biggest
night of the year!

56
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,766
That's stupid.

57
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,201
See your turdy trailer
some other time.

58
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:07,651
But all the other kids
are gonna watch it

59
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,067
And talk about it
in school tomorrow!

60
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:10,199
No, turds.

61
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:11,300
Shelly, did i ever tell you
how hot i think you are?

62
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,499
Shut up, fat turd!

63
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,334
I'm not a fat turd,
i'm a stocky turd!

64
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:15,998
<i>We're not watching this.</i>

65
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,799
Come on! Look, i apologize-

66
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,332
But shelly, it's the
russell crowe show!

67
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,100
You always said there's nothing
you love more than russell crowe.

68
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:24,968
There is one thing i love
more than russell crowe,

69
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,000
And that is
seeing you unhappy.

70
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:28,332
So buffy it is.

71
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,484
Shelly, please
let us watch!

72
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,566
We'll do anything,
anything!

73
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,651
Alright, i just started my
period and i need tampons.

74
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:38,701
If one of you turds go buy
them at the store for me,

75
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:40,499
You can watch
your stupid turd show

76
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:43,267
With your stupid turd movie
commercial in it.

77
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:45,933
Okay, deal.

78
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:51,133
Then they better be here when
i come back downstairs, turds!

79
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,165
Well that was a lot of fun,
wasn't it, kids?

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,868
But it looks like if we're
gonna get in more fights,

81
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:57,485
We're gonna have to
go look for 'em!

82
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,032
Dude, why'd you
make that deal?

83
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,167
If we're out buying tampons
we'll miss the trailer anyway!

84
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,599
Yeah!

85
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:04,234
Well, only one of us
has to go to the store,

86
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,466
The others
can watch.

87
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,968
You'd miss the
new trailer?

88
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:07,799
Dude, i'm not going.

89
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,098
Alright, we'll have
to play for it.

90
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,367
If your name is
butters you have to go.

91
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,666
Okay, so what's
your name?

92
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,017
Stan. Okay, what's your name?

93
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,334
Kyle. Kyle
- What's your name?

94
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,965
Butters!

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,232
Aww, i lose,
huh?

96
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,667
Aww, yeah, butters,
you lose.

97
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,801
Sorry, tough break.

98
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,866
Just hurry,
butters,

99
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:23,934
You can probably
make it back in time

100
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,568
Before the first
commercial break.

101
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:27,132
Oh, jesus, i gotta
run like the wind!

102
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:29,300
That was a lot of fun,
wasn't it, kids?

103
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,100
Dude, thank god
for stupid people.

104
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,098
Amen.

105
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,868
Where should we go
fight people next, tugga?

106
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,165
Moooooop.
Great idea!

107
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,968
Tugga thinks we should go to
the far away country of china.

108
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:44,752
China is one of the oldest
civilizations on earth!

109
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,501
And from what i understand,
they love a good fight!

110
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,299
So let's go!

111
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,566
Mooooooop,
mooooooop.

112
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,734
Oh, my god,

113
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,968
Oh, my god,
it's russell crowe!

114
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,132
Oh my- Blah ehh
ehhh eh ehhhh!

115
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,334
Why don't you mind your
own business, ya scrotum!

116
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,899
Ow.

117
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,850
* making movies,
making songs *

118
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,732
* and fightin'
'round the world! *

119
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,367
Dude, why is this guy always
beating everybody up?

120
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:09,734
* what a glorious day
to spend away *

121
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,234
* fightin'
'round the world *

122
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,634
What's wrong with the
colors on your tv, stan?

123
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,551
They're all
saturated.

124
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:20,434
They look fine to me.

125
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,783
Just don't mess
with it, cartman.

126
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:25,300
No, no, the cable wire
must be loose.

127
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:27,232
Just leave it alone.

128
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,100
Dude, do you want to see the
terrance and phillip trailer

129
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,100
With messed up colors?

130
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:30,684
I don't.

131
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:31,493
How's that?

132
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:32,232
That's worse!

133
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,267
Okay, how about
that-

134
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,133
Dude! Goddammit, cartman, you broke it!

135
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,634
It was just-
I just-

136
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,065
Butters,
you asshole!

137
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,750
Dude, the commercials
could start any time!

138
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,365
I don't think we're
watching them on this tv.

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,067
Goddammit! Come on, we can
watch it over at my house!

140
00:04:51,102 --> 00:04:52,866
Get all the stuff!

141
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,334
Hey, fellas!
I got the tampons!

142
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,666
I didn't miss it,
did i?

143
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:58,100
We're going to kyle's
house to watch!

144
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,601
Come on!
Oh, jeez!

145
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,499
Oh, jeez,
oh, jeez.

146
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:05,501
Hurry, we can't miss
the commercials!

147
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:14,367
But the palestinian government
is not going to see any future-

148
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,065
Oh, oh!

149
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,098
Hurry, hurry,
hurry!

150
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,200
And so here we are,
in history-Rich china!

151
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,499
Me made it!

152
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,100
It hasn't gone to
commercials yet!

153
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:25,065
Whew!Whew!
Whew!

154
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,717
Hey, i'm a
turtle bat.

155
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,334
Ugh, oh, my god,
ugh...

156
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,566
Ba ba ba ba!

157
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,833
No, ike, they're
playing the trailer

158
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:32,200
To the new terrance and phillip
movie during the show,

159
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,084
And we have to
watch it!

160
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,899
This is tea-Eeny-Man square.

161
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:42,100
Lots of good fighting has gone
on here throughout the years,

162
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:46,267
Including a fantastic massacre
that took place back in '93.

163
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,383
These chinamen can grow
to over five feet tall,

164
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,667
And in a fight, are known
to kick with their legs.

165
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:58,634
Let's see if we can get in
for a closer look.

166
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,965
Oy! I've gotten
close enough now,

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,566
That they're startin' to get
real frightened.

168
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,868
You can see the fine hairs
on the back of their necks

169
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,685
Standin' on end.

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,467
Gotcha, mate!

171
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:16,666
Alright, you wanna
fight, huh?!

172
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,901
Think you can take me,
ya little buggas?!

173
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:20,300
Oh!

174
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,000
Ahh!

175
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,567
God, when is this gonna
get to the commercials?

176
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,065
Kyle, ike says you
kicked him off the tv.

177
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,868
They're going to show the new
terrance and phillip trailer!

178
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,734
You know your brother
watches macneil-Lehrer report

179
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,299
Every night at ten.

180
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,632
It has a bunny rabbit
on a night!

181
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,801
But dad! This is all the
never-Before-Seen footage!

182
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,466
It doesn't matter-
Ten to eleven

183
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,834
Is ike's time to
watch macneil-Lehrer.

184
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,432
Goddammit!
C'mon, guys!

185
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,968
We gotta go to
butters house!

186
00:06:49,003 --> 00:06:50,365
Awww!

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,634
Wait, fellas, we can't
go to my house!

188
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,167
We can't to
my house either!

189
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,265
It's being fumigated!

190
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,799
Agh- Wait!
Chef just a got

191
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,033
A new plasma screen tv
with surround sound!

192
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,098
Let's go to his house,
come on!

193
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,032
- Taken place there
all these years

194
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:05,334
Is sure to continue until
the governments of those regions

195
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,701
Can actually
come about some...

196
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,267
It's a burning flag!

197
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,632
Ugh... you guys...
i'm seriously.

198
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:21,100
Goddammit, if we
missed the commercials

199
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:22,851
I'll never forgive
my brother!

200
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:24,567
Oh, hello there,
children.

201
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:25,332
Hey, chef!

202
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,065
Uh...
how's it going?

203
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,501
Oh, you wanted to see
the new tv, huh?

204
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:32,933
Pretty cool, ain't it?

205
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:34,399
Yeah, yeah, how do you
change the channels?

206
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,901
I don't know, this tv has more
features than a space shuttle.

207
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:39,234
I can't figure it out
at all.

208
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,432
Bloomin' taj mahal-

209
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,599
You got it!
You got it!

210
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,501
Freakin' indies really
put up a fight!

211
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:44,300
We made it!
Oh, thank god!

212
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:46,632
Russell crowe?

213
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,032
Children, you shouldn't be
watching a show

214
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,267
About a man who beats people up
because he's insecure.

215
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,467
We don't give two craps
about russell crowe, chef.

216
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,767
We just want to see
the trailer for

217
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:54,998
The new terrance
and phillip movie

218
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,666
That's supposed to play
during the commercials.

219
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,634
Alright, everyone, we're gonna
take our first commercial break.

220
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,466
But be sure not to
go anywhere,

221
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,234
Because there's lots more people
to beat up!

222
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:05,868
Here they come!

223
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,467
The commercials!

224
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,234
And now back to russell crowe,
fightin' around the world!

225
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,499
Awww!

226
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,732
Aw, they didn't
play it!

227
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,467
They didn't show the
terrance and phillip trailer.

228
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:17,751
I knew it, i knew
they wouldn't play it

229
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:18,965
During the first
commercial break!

230
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,533
Yeah, they want everyone
to stick around

231
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,032
And watch more of
this retarded show.

232
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,167
* making movies,
making songs *

233
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,267
* and fightin'
'round the world! *

234
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:27,799
Oy! Now tugga's
brought me

235
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,501
To one of the greatest places
for fightin' in north america:

236
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,132
Brooklyn, new york.

237
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,566
Lots of minorities here,

238
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,699
And they don't take kindly
to whitey!

239
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:38,234
Let's get a closer look!
Come on, tugga!

240
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,767
Moooop!

241
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,901
Looks like we got some black
people, and some puerto ricans.

242
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,801
Notice the colorful rags
on their heads,

243
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:53,051
Meaning they could be
part of a gang

244
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:55,267
And therefore,
real used to fightin'.

245
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,617
Hey, look at that guy
over there,

246
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:00,234
Ain't that that
"gladiator" guy?

247
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,265
Where?

248
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,667
Behind that plant,
next to that tugboat.

249
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:06,933
Oh, yeah,
i think it is.

250
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,399
"Oh, my god, it's
the gladiator guy!

251
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:11,032
Oh my god, i've never
seen an actor before!"

252
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:15,701
Why don't you choke on some
pig vomit, you stupid sods!

253
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:17,651
Why can't this guy
control his temper?

254
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,567
Well? You all just
gonna stand there

255
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,300
Or are you
gonna fight?!

256
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,098
Ooh!

257
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,833
Crikey!
You done it now!

258
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,499
This tv is great,
chef.

259
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,167
Yeah, and it's got all kinds
of cool features, too!

260
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,801
Check this out- You can watch
3 channels all at once.

261
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:34,068
I think if you hit
this button here-

262
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,300
No, no wait-
You hit this button here-

263
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,467
No, that's not it,
let's see-

264
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,732
Menu, function-

265
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:41,866
Dude, put it back,
chef,

266
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:42,868
More commercials
might come on soon.

267
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:44,651
Let's see, menu...
aw, dammit.

268
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:46,400
Get it back
to normal, chef!

269
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,599
I'm trying,
children!

270
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:49,734
Menu, back, function,
enter-

271
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,799
No, no- Back!
H.E.M?

272
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,667
Human eradication mode,
active.

273
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,599
Oh, goddammit!
The tv left!

274
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,751
But the next commercials
will be on soon!

275
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,868
Come on, we gotta
go somewhere else!

276
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,299
Ahhhh!

277
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:20,933
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

278
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:24,567
The bar! They've got
a tv at the bar!

279
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,934
Agh! Agh!
I'm dying!

280
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,701
You fight like norwegians,
ya fairies!

281
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,098
Phew!

282
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:39,998
We made it.

283
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,098
This is killing me.

284
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:42,901
The human body was not meant
to move quickly like that.

285
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,499
These are
the florida keys...

286
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,000
A remote island chain
just a few miles from-

287
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,998
Oy, wait a minute!

288
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,968
Wasn't i just in brooklyn
fightin' minorities?

289
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,367
What happened
with that?!

290
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,666
Mooooooop.

291
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,632
It's that
goddamn editor!

292
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,868
He cut the brooklyn scene
short!

293
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:01,752
Tugga, i'm gonna get him!

294
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,566
Yeah...
i'm just working.

295
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,950
I'll probably be done
around seven.

296
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,300
Who the hell do you
think you are?!

297
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,332
I'm the editor.

298
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:12,900
I know you're
the bloomin' editor!

299
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,399
I mean, who do you
think you are

300
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,901
Cutting one of my
fightin' scenes short?!

301
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:18,601
Dude, the director said
to cut it!

302
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,065
My fightin' is poetry!

303
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,300
You don't edit russell crowe's
poetry, ya testicle!

304
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:27,699
Ah! Oh!

305
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,165
Well, that guy
is just plain nuts.

306
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,165
Hey, hey, hey, whoa,
you kids can't be in here!

307
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,650
We're not kids, we're
full-Grown men with dwarfism!

308
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:39,100
How dare you assume that
all midgets are children!

309
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,032
We demand an apology!

310
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,534
You ain't midgets,
your lips are too full.

311
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,732
Now get out!

312
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,467
But we have to watch the
commercials in this show!

313
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:47,866
Look, this is a bar.

314
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,466
We can't have children
in here-

315
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,032
People come here for
debauchery and sin.

316
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,100
Butters will give handjobs
in the corner for a dollar.

317
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:56,801
Sure! I'm good at
all kinds of jobs!

318
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,265
Get out!

319
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,699
Aagh!

320
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,000
Come on, we gotta
get to a tv!

321
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,267
Oh, you've got to
be kidding me!

322
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,699
Yes, is this
customer service?

323
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,265
I'm having a problem
with my new television.

324
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,667
It sprouted laser guns and started
walking around shooting people.

325
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,299
Uh-Huh... okay...

326
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:28,467
Oh, so i press 'menu',
then 'function'?

327
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:30,901
Jesus!
Aaaaghgh!

328
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:33,265
No, that didn't work.

329
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,901
Did i set
the internal clock?

330
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,432
Uh, no.

331
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,065
Oh, really?

332
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,634
Well, how do i
do that?

333
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,065
We're not too late!

334
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,267
Come on, tugga ol' mate,
why you looking so down?

335
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,466
Mooo, mooooop.

336
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,732
Tugga's in a bit of
a sad state.

337
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,934
Seems his girlfriend and him
had a bit of a row last night.

338
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:07,201
Mooooooop.

339
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,399
What is this?

340
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:10,399
Come on,
cheer up, tugga.

341
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,367
How can i make you
feel better?

342
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:14,499
I know!

343
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,400
How would you like me
to sing one of the songs

344
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,098
Off me new album?!

345
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:20,017
Mooooooooop!
Moooooop!

346
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,866
What's that, tugga?

347
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,334
You say you really love
the songs on my album?!

348
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,265
Moooooop!

349
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,000

* get there somehow

356
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:46,499
Mooop!

363
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,232
Tugga!

364
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:11,666
Tugga shot himself!

365
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:14,101
Has russell lost tugger
for good?

366
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:16,501
Find out after
these messages.

367
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:17,466
Here we go!

368
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:20,267
Commercial break
number two!

369
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:26,767
And now back to russell crowe,
fightin' around the world!

370
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,332
That's it? That's all the commercials?

371
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,400
They didn't play the terrance
and phillip trailer again!

372
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,834
I knew it!
They're waiting until

373
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,251
The very last
commercial break!

374
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,599
Ugh! We're gonna
end up watching

375
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,501
This whole retarded
russell crowe show.

376
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,332
Tugga...

377
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,532
Why'd you do it,
tugga?

378
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,299
Doctor? Tell me
how he is, doctor!

379
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,934
Well, he's a very sick
little tugboat-

380
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,065
What is this?

381
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,901
We want to watch "puppies
from around the world".

382
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,968
Yeah, we don't
like this show.

383
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:52,833
Shh! Okay?

384
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,300
Old people need to
be quiet right now.

385
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,232
Ya gotta
save him, doc!

386
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:59,499
Tugga! He's me
best friend!

387
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,200
The only friend
in the world who-

388
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,632
He's going to live,
but-

389
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,167
Oy! Don't ya
interrupt me, ya vagina!

390
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:07,667
I was giving a heart-
Wrenching soliloquy

391
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,734
About me feelin's
for tugga!

392
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,899
Sorry.

393
00:15:10,934 --> 00:15:12,032
Oh, tugga!

394
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:15,300
Tugga, the world wouldn't be
as bright without ya, mate!

395
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,299
Give it to me straight,
doctor!

396
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:20,868
Will tugga live?
Tell me the truth!

397
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,132
Now?

398
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,065
Yes, now's fine.

399
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,065
Oh, uh, your tugboat's
going to be okay.

400
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,067
He just needs an oil change
and a new steam stack.

401
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:31,100
Oodalolly!
You hear that everybody!

402
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,732
Tugga's gonna be okay!

403
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,000
You what that makes me
feel like doin'?

404
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,367
Fightin'!

405
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,068
Ah!

406
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,699
Ooh!

407
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,367
This show is too violent!
Put the puppies back on!

408
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,866
Yeah!
Puppies.

409
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,666
Shut up!
Shut the hell up!

410
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,334
We're watching this until
the next commercial,

411
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:49,998
And that's final,
old people!

412
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,817
Alright, that does it!
We know how to get our way!

413
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,601
Everyone, on the count of 3,
release your bowels!

414
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,767
One, two!

415
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:02,365
Uuuugh!

416
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh god,
it's horrible!

417
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,868
That's disgusting,
dude!

418
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,866
God, i hate
old people!

419
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,200
We have to go butters
or cartman's house,

420
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,399
We have nowhere
else to go!

421
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,151
I told you! We can't go to my house!

422
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,833
And my house is
being fumigated!

423
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:14,801
Well, screw it!
We'll watch in your house

424
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:17,365
Even if it is
being fumigated!

425
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,067
Ah, ah... we gotta go...
come on...

426
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:25,167
Aghh! Aghh! Aghh!

427
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,432
Turn it on,
turn it on!

428
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:31,601
Crikey! Ol' tugga looks
healthy, happy and-

429
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,165
Fit as a whistle!

430
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,032
It's okay,
it's still the show.

431
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:38,199
But you know,
tugga's attempted suicide

432
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:41,501
Has made me realize that
i should take up a cause.

433
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,685
Most great actors
take up causes,

434
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,799
And i'm the greatest
of them all!

435
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,234
So, from now on, i'm gonna
spend all my spare time

436
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,732
Fighting cancer.

437
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,300
Right! Where is that pussy
cancer anyway?!

438
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:58,167
Oh dude, i don't know
how long i can take it.

439
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:01,000
Me neither, i'll be dead
before the commercials!

440
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:02,065
Wait a minute!

441
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,934
I forgot there's a black & white
tv back at my house!

442
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:04,501
Will your sister
let us watch it?

443
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:07,065
She has to!

444
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,300
Hurry, the commercial's
gonna be on any minute!

445
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:12,968
Oh, god! Oh, god!

446
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,566
Oh, jesus help me!

447
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,917
Oh no!
I've lost a doughnut!

448
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,199
Hagah! Hagaah!
Oh my god!

449
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:22,701
Leave no doughnut behind!
Ha ha!

450
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:25,866
Oh, jesus! Wait! What?

451
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,432
I never gave shelly
her tampons!

452
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,467
She's been this whole time
without them.

453
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,767
Ahhhhhh!

454
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:45,034
I told you i needed
tampons, tuuuurds!

455
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:49,167
Look, crack addicts
with a television!

456
00:17:55,133 --> 00:18:00,400
<i>Well, we couldn't find cancer,
but we found a man with cancer.</i>

457
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:02,167
Take that, cancer!

458
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:04,265
And that!

459
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,032
Moooop! Moooop!

460
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:09,701
The last commercial break has
to be coming any second!

461
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,167
Aaaagh!

462
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,998
Yes, i pressed 'menu'
three times!

463
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:21,534
No, it's giving me
the same 'error' message!

464
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:25,267
Yes, i read the
instruction manual!

465
00:18:25,302 --> 00:18:26,466
Where do we go?!

466
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,133
Oh jesus, now where
do we go?!

467
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,299
We've tried
everywhere!

468
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,133
Butters, are you absolutely
sure we can't go to your house?

469
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:32,617
I'm sure,
there's no way!

470
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:33,943
Well, why not?
Because!

471
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,772
My parents are
out of town,

472
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,532
And i don't have
a babysitter!

473
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,000
Oh, goddammit,
you better be kidding.

474
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,017
No, i really don't
have a babysitter,

475
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,965
That's why i'm
staying at stan's.

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,267
This whole time your tv is in
a house with nobody in it?

477
00:18:46,302 --> 00:18:49,434
Come on, let's just go,
we'll kill butters later!

478
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,067
And so, we'll be right back,
after these commercials!

479
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,299
We made it!

480
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:02,067
The last commercial
break is starting!

481
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,868
Don't go anywhere-
Russell crowe will be right back

482
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,499
After a few more
commercials!

483
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:12,098
These commercials are all
so goddamned stupid!

484
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,799
Jesus christ, how long is this
commercial break gonna be?

485
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,667
What if they don't show the
terrance and phillip trailer at all?

486
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,584
What if we went through
all this for nothing?

487
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,467
They have to show it!
They promised they would!

488
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:21,866
You guys, calm down!

489
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,199
This is what tv shows
always do!

490
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:24,868
They make the last
commercial break the longest.

491
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,567
That's bullcrap!
Tv shows are gay!

492
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,265
Wait a minute!
Look!

493
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,683
The following
preview is-

494
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,032
This is it!
This is it!

495
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,866
Coming this summer...

496
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,567
The greatest canadian duo
of all time is back.

497
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,484
Whooo-Hooo!
Yeeesss!

498
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,199
That looks
awesome!

499
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:15,450
They were wearing
cowboy hats!

500
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,632
Did you see?
Did you see?!

501
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,833
Clyde, clyde,
did you guys see it?!

502
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,400
Yeah! We think it's
gonna be good too!

503
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,668
I'm so glad we
didn't miss it!

504
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:21,668
You guys, clyde said
he taped it

505
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:22,634
And kids can
come over now to see!

506
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,666
Oh dude, let's go!

507
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,100
It looks even better than
their first movie, huh?

508
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:26,965
Yeah, sure does!

509
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
I wonder if it's
all a western!

510
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:29,965
How far away
is june?

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,634
Well, we sure had a good time
today, didn't we, kids?

512
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,251
We fought some chinamen,
a few peckers,

513
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:37,799
And a lot of colombians
to name just a few.

514
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:41,801
But i sure am glad we got ol'
wally-Bee back, aren't you?

515
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,518
I'm glad to be back,
russell!

516
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:47,165
Oh, my god,
it's russell crowe!

517
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,701
"Oh, my god,
