OKAY, HERE HE COMES.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,234
WHO WANTS TO TELL HIM ?

16
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,334
I'LL DO IT.

17
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,968
HEY, FELLAS !
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED ME !

18
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,901
THERE'S A PIE EATING CONTEST
DOWN AT THE FIREHOUSE,

19
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,968
AND I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD ALL GO !

20
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:45,934
BUTTERS, COULD YOU
TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE ?

21
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:48,000
WELL, SURE.

22
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,367
BUTTERS, WE HAVE TO HAVE A VERY
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION.

23
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,000
WHAT IS IT ?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,067
WELL, IN THE MONTHS SINCE
OUR FRIEND KENNY DIED

25
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,501
YOU'VE REALLY STEPPED UP
AS A FRIEND

26
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,400
AND "FILLED THE GAP",
SO TO SPEAK.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,567
OH, IT'S MY PLEASURE !

28
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,734
I LOVE BEING YOU GUYS'
NEW FRIEND.

29
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:06,567
YES, WELL, BUTTERS,
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING OUT.

30
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,133
NOT WORKING OUT ?

31
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:12,133
I'M AFRAID WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
LET YOU GO-- AS OUR FRIEND.

32
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,501
YOU'RE JUST TOO...

33
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,300
LAME.
LAME, YES.

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,501
BUT I CAN GET BETTER.

35
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,400
BUTTERS, YOU JUST DON'T REALLY
FIT IN WITH US HERE.

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,601
WE THINK IT'S BEST
FOR ALL OF US

37
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,133
IF YOU LOOK FOR FRIENDSHIP
OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE.

38
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,467
BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK
YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK

39
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,667
AND ATTEMPTS AT
BEING OUR FRIEND.

40
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,934
LAME AS THEY WERE.

41
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,000
BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE REALLY
GETTING ALONG GREAT.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,701
I THOUGHT WE WERE REALLY
HAVING FUN TOGETHER.

43
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:32,267
YES, WELL, WE WEREN'T.

44
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,767
PLEASE, FELLAS,
DON'T FIRE ME.

45
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,534
WE'RE SORRY, BUTTERS,
OUR MIND IS MADE UP.

46
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,534
BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.

47
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,067
YOU KNOW YOUR WAY OUT, RIGHT ?

48
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,467
PHEW !
WHEW !

49
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:55,067
HE TOOK THAT
PRETTY WELL I THINK.

50
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:55,968
WHO CARES ?

51
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,033
SO LET'S GET STARTED
ON WHO'S GONNA BE

52
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,667
THE NEW PERSON TO
TAKE KENNY'S PLACE.

53
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,701
THE WORLD ISN'T FAIR.

54
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,701
I DO EVERYTHING
PEOPLE ASK ME TO.

55
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,033
I STAND IN THE
LUNCH LINES FOR THEM...

56
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,767
I BUY TAMPONS AT
THE STORE FOR THEM...

57
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,501
I GO ON MAURY POVICH WITH
BALLS ON MY CHIN FOR THEM.

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
AND YET,
NOBODY ACCEPTS ME.

59
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,534
I AM AN OUTCAST--

60
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,567
A SHADOW OF A MAN WHO CAN FIND
NO COMPANIONSHIP,

61
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,234
NO LOVE FROM OTHERS.

62
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,367
FINE !

63
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,734
IF I'M TO BE
AN OUTCAST, SO BE IT.

64
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,133
I'M THROUGH DOING WHAT
OTHERS TELL ME TO DO,

65
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,601
AND I AM SICK OF THIS WORLD
AND THE STINKY PEOPLE IN IT.

66
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,734
FROM NOW ON,
I WILL DEDICATE MY LIFE

67
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,734
TO BRINGING CHAOS TO THE WORLD
THAT HAS DEJECTED ME !

68
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,267
I WILL BECOME THE
GREATEST SUPER-VILLAIN

69
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,033
THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN !

70
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:51,200
WHERE I GO,
DESTRUCTION WILL FOLLOW !

71
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,968
PREPARE, OH LITTLE TOWN.

72
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,067
PREPARE FOR THE
GREATEST SUPER-VILLAIN

73
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,067
YOU HAVE
EVER SEEN...

74
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,534
PROFESSOR CHAOS !

75
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,868
( mom knocks )
BUTTERS, TIME FOR BED.

76
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,167
OKAY, MOM.

77
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,334
YES, SLEEP FOR NOW.

78
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,501
TOMORROW,
THE CHAOS BEGINS.

79
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,334
HA HA...

80
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,200
HA HA HA...

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,634
HA HA HA
HA HA HA !

82
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,567
AH HA HA HA !

83
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,267
ALRIGHT, WE WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY FOR COMING,

84
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,267
THIS IS A GREAT TURNOUT.

85
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,734
UH, AS YOU KNOW, OUR FRIEND
KENNY DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO

86
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:49,267
AND WE ARE LOOKING TO FILL
THE VOID WITH A NEW FRIEND.

87
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,334
YOU'VE ALL BEEN SELECTED
AS POSSIBLE CANDIDATES,

88
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,100
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS
ONLY ROOM FOR ONE OF YOU.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,033
AND SO, STAN AND KYLE AND I WILL
BE SPENDING THE NEXT FEW DAYS

90
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,868
GOING OUT WITH EACH ONE OF YOU,
AND NARROWING OUR CHOICES DOWN,

91
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,534
UNTIL WE THINK WE'VE FOUND
THE PERFECT FRIEND.

92
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,767
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ?

93
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,367
WHAT IF WE DON'T
WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND ?

94
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,834
CLYDE... OKAY ?

95
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,434
NOW, THE FIRST THING WE HAVE
TO DO IS CUT THE LIST DOWN

96
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,434
FROM 20 CHOICES TO 10.

97
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,667
AND SO TODAY WE WILL
ALL BE GOING

98
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,200
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK TOGETHER
TO SEE WHO WE WANT TO CUT.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THIS
WILL ALL BE VIDEOTAPED,

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,167
SO PUT ON YOUR BEST FRIEND FACES
AND MAY THE BEST FRIEND WIN !

101
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:27,133
OH, AND WE WILL BE NEEDING
A $10 PER PERSON ENTRANCE FEE.

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,934
ORDER 23 IS UP,
AND ORDER 24 IS UP.

103
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,601
( ding-ding )

104
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,467
UH, WAITRESS, I ACTUALLY
ORDERED THE CHICKEN SOUP.

105
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,701
THIS IS MINESTRONE.

106
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,300
YEAH, I HAD THE
MINESTRONE OVER HERE.

107
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,601
AH HA HA !
HA HA HA HAAA !

108
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,734
HA HA HA
HA HAAA !

109
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:17,734
I AM PROFESSOR CHAOS !

110
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,400
AND NOW THIS PUNY WORLD
WILL BOW DOWN TO ME !

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,267
HA AH HA HAAA !

112
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,901
( Stan )
SO TODAY, WE WENT TO
THE AMUSEMENT PARK

113
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,200
WITH ALL OUR
POSSIBLE FRIENDS.

114
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,300
IT WAS A REALLY FUN TIME,
WE RODE ALL THE RIDES,

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
AND EVERYONE
GOT ALONG GREAT.

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,734
I THINK THE PERSON
THAT STOOD OUT MOST

117
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,200
AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK
WAS JIMMY.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,300
WELL, THE REASON I THINK I WOULD
MAKE THE PERFECT FOURTH FRIEND

119
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,400
IS THAT I LOVE
TELLING JOKES.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,734
YOU KNOW, WHO DOESN'T
LIKE TO LAUGH ?

121
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,334
TWEEK-- NOW THERE'S
AN INTERESTING CHOICE.

122
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,334
TWEEK HAS A LOT OF QUALITIES
THAT I LOOK FOR IN A FRIEND.

123
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,701
WHAT IF THEY DON'T
PICK ME ?

124
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,033
WHAT IF THEY
GET US ALL, MAN ?

125
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,868
I MEAN, CHRIST, IF THEY CAN
GET TO THE PENTAGON

126
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,300
THEY CAN GET
TO US ALL, MAN !

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,534
AAAGH !

128
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,033
I THINK I DESERVE TO TAKE
KENNY'S PLACE THE MOST,

129
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,367
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HANGING AROUND
THESE GUYS FOR LIKE, FIVE YEARS

130
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,501
AND I NEVER GET
TO SAY OR DO ANYTHING.

131
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,033
YEAH, I'VE ALWAYS
SEEN THAT KID IN CLASS,

132
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,701
BUT HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING,
HE'S MORE LIKE A PROP.

133
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,667
TOWELIE IS A TOUGH CHOICE,
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I CAN SEE

134
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,434
HOW ALWAYS HAVING A TOWEL AROUND
COULD COME IN HANDY,

135
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,901
HE'S JUST ALWAYS SO HIGH.

136
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,234
YEAH, I REALLY HOPE
I WIN BECAUSE--

137
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,434
WAIT, WHAT IS THIS AGAIN ?

138
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,601
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON.

139
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,267
WE DECIDED TO GET SOME
ONE-ON-ONE TIME WITH JIMMY

140
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,601
AND RIDE THE LOG RIDE.

141
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,734
AND THE GREAT THING WAS THAT
BECAUSE JIMMY'S CRIPPLED

142
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,734
WE GOT TO GO TO
THE FRONT OF THE LINE.

143
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,667
THAT WAS DEFINITELY BIG POINTS
FOR JIMMY, Y'KNOW.

144
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,167
BUT THEN, WE GET TO
THE RIDE ITSELF AND...

145
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,167
HEY, I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP
GETTING IN THE LOG, FELLAS.

146
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,367
OH, SHUT HER DOWN,
SOMEONE NEEDS ASSISTANCE.

147
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,534
OH, REALLY ?

148
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,000
THAT'S GONNA
COST SOME POINTS.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,801
BUT RIGHT NOW I'D SAY IF WE'RE
GONNA HAVE A RETARD FOR A FRIEND

150
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,968
I'D HAVE TO PICK TIMMY,

151
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,167
BECAUSE TIMMY DOESN'T
TELL LAME JOKES.

152
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,834
( Jimmy )
BOY, ISN'T THIS
GREAT, FELLAS ?

153
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,667
ARE WE GREAT PALS
OR WHAT ?

154
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,934
( Kyle )
ONE THING'S FOR SURE,

155
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,200
PICKING OUR NEW FRIEND
ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,534
KNEEL !

157
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,267
KNEEL BEFORE
PROFESSOR CHAOS !

158
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:06,734
HA HA, HA HA HA !

159
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,667
AHH HA HA HAA !
HA HA HAAA !

160
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,701
HEE HA HA HA HAA !

161
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,601
OH, THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES
WHEN THEY GOT THE WRONG SOUP !

162
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,133
I LOVE BRINGING CHAOS !

163
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,567
HA !

164
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,567
HA HA HAA !

165
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,434
AND THAT IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

166
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,167
HA HA HA,
HA HA HA HAA !!

167
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,901
ALRIGHT, EVERYONE,
IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION

168
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,767
BUT BASED ON OUR TIME WITH YOU
ALL AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK,

169
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,267
WE HAVE WHITTLED OUR
CHOICES DOWN TO 10.

170
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,501
IF YOU RECEIVE A ROSE,

THAT ERASER
IS IN MY BACKYARD,

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,434
BURIED THREE FEET BELOW
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.

00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,300
AND DO YOU EVEN
SUSPECT ME ?  NO.

238
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
NOW WE SHALL SEE HOW YOU ALL
LIKE YOUR DEAR CHALKBOARD

239
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
WITHOUT AN ERASER !

240
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,601

NOW, WHENEVER WE MULTIPLY
A NUMBER TIMES FIVE

248
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,033
THE RESULT IS GOING TO END
IN A ZERO OR FIVE.

249
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,767
MS. CHOKSONDIK ?
WHAT IS IT, BUTTERS ?

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,601

00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,767
VERY WELL !

346
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,000
YOU CALLED OUT
PROFESSOR CHAOS,

347
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,234
AND YOU ALSO CALLED OUT
YOUR OWN DEMISE !

348
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,501
GO NOW, MY MINIONS !

349
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,167
GO AND TAKE THIS
FOOLISH MORTAL DOWN !

350
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,067
AW, MINIONS,
NOT THAT WAY.

351
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,167
COME BACK, MINIONS.

352
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,000
I'M NOT TRYING TO CALL YOU
OUT-- PROFESSOR CHAOS.

353
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,100
I WANT TO JOIN YOU.

354
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,934
JOIN ME ?

355
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:37,400
YEAH, I WANT TO JOIN YOU IN
YOUR CONQUEST OF DESTRUCTION.

356
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,534
BUT WHY ?

357
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,868
I'M AN OUTCAST TOO--

358
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,767
A FRAIL CHILD
CAST ASIDE BY SOCIETY.

359
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,000
I WANT TO FOLLOW YOU AND--
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,133
VERY WELL, YOU SHALL BE
MY ACCOMPLICE IN EVIL.

361
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,701
TOGETHER, WE SHALL BRING
THE WORLD TO ITS KNEES

362
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:53,267
AND MAKE ALL THOSE WHO BANISHED
US FROM SOCIETY RUN WRECKED.

363
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,567
DO I GET A NEAT-O COSTUME MADE
OUT OF ALUMINUM FOIL TOO ?

364
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:56,667
WELL, SURE YOU DO.

365
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,400
I AM PROFESSOR AND
YOU SHALL BE MY GENERAL.

366
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,234
FROM NOW ON YOU ARE
GENERAL... DISARRAY.

367
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,334
GENERAL DISARRAY.

368
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,000
NOW LET US GO LOOK
FOR MY MINIONS !

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,601
BECAUSE THEY RAN AWAY...

370
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,234
THE SWIMSUIT COMPETITION
REALLY GAVE US A FRESH LOOK

371
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:18,267
AT SOME OF THE CANDIDATES.

372
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,000
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I DID TOO WELL

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,434
IN THE BATHING SUIT
COMPETITION.

374
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,434
BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE
TALENT SHOW COMPETITION.

375
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:27,234
THAT'LL REALLY BE MY CHANCE
TO... SHINE.

376
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,033
WOW, WHAT A
TERRIFIC AUDIENCE.

377
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:31,234
SO ANYWAY,
A GUY WALKS INTO A B...

378
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,901
A GUY WALKS
INTO A B...

379
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,834
A GUY WALKS,
A GUYS WALK INTO A B-B...

380
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:41,067
( struggling to play intro
to "Stairway to Heaven" )

381
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,267
OKAY, WAIT.

382
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,534
NO, NO, WAIT.

383
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,200
NEXT, PLEASE.

384
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ?

385
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,167
ANYTHING THAT'LL
IMPRESS US, TOKEN.

386
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,434
IF YOU WERE OUR FRIEND,

387
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,968
HOW WOULD YOU KEEP US
ENTERTAINED ?

388
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,467
UH... OH, I KNOW !

389
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,167
VERY NICE.

390
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,667
I LIKE IT.

391
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,067
TOKEN WAS THE DEFINITE WINNER
OF THE TALENT SHOW.

392
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,701
BUT THEN WE DECIDED TO TAKE
EVERYONE TO A BASEBALL GAME,

393
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,767
TO SEE HOW WE
GOT ALONG THERE.

394
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,634
( announcer )
THERE GOES A HIT TO LEFT FIELD !

395
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,400
AND FOLEY'S GOING TO SCORE !

396
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,567
WOO-HOO !

397
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,801
YEAH !
ISN'T THIS GREAT ?

398
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:20,868
DRINKS !
GET YOUR DRINKS HERE !

399
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,634
YES, COULD I HAVE
SOME TEA, PLEASE ?

400
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,467
YOU DON'T DRINK TEA
AT A BASEBALL GAME,

401
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,634
YOU FRENCH
PIECE OF CRAP !

402
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,667
OH, VERY WELL--

403
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,734
JUST SOME
CRUMPETS THEN.

404
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:28,868
ALRIGHT,
THAT DOES IT !

405
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:29,367
PIP, GET THE
FUDGE OUT !

406
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,667
NEXT !

407
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,934
OKAY, LET'S TRY THIS.

408
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,267
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE JUMBOTRON ?

409
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,934
People of earth !

410
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,300
Your meaningless lives
are about to end !

411
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
I am Professor Chaos

412
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,033
and this is my partner in evil,
General Disarray.

413
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,567
In the past few days I have
rained terror down

414
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,234
upon the society
that shunned me,

415
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:54,968
and now it is time for
my final labor of loathing.

416
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:58,701
I am going to--
flood the world !

417
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,434
FLOOD THE WORLD !
MY GOD !

418
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,767
I DON'T WANNA DIE.
I DON'T WANNA DIE !

419
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,701
Oh yes, every living creature
and every sacred building

420
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,868
will soon be under leagues and
leagues of cold and dark water !

421
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,901
And there is nothing
you can do to stop it !

422
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:15,467
General Disarray, begin
the flooding of Earth !

423
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,767
You brought this
upon yourselves !

424
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,133
You made the outcasts
of the world.

425
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,000
Now watch, watch as your
precious planet drowns !

426
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,701
Watch !

427
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,868
DEAR CHRIST,
WHO WILL SAVE US ?

428
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,000
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE
TIME TO LIVE.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,701
HOW SHALL WE SPEND OUR
LAST HOURS ON EARTH ?

430
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,334
OUR REIGN OF TERROR
IS COMPLETE !

431
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,501
THE TURMOIL HAS NOW
COME FULL CIRCLE !

432
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,200
HEY, IS THAT HOSE ON FULL,
GENERAL DISARRAY ?

433
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,467
IT'S ON ALL THE WAY.

434
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,534
OH, ALRIGHT THEN.

435
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,133
NOTHING TO DO NOW BUT
WATCH THE WORLD DIE !

436
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,367
HA, HA HA HAAA !

437
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,000
HA HA HAA !

438
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,200
BOY, THIS SURE IS
TAKING A LONG TIME.

439
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,734
OKAY, SO HOW DO
WE ALL FEEL

440
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,634
ABOUT TOWELIE
AS OUR NEW FRIEND ?

441
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,100
I THINK
TOWELIE'S AWESOME.

442
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,834
TOWELIE'S COOL, BUT HE GETS
STONED ALL THE TIME.

443
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,434
YOU CAN'T REALLY
RELY ON HIM FOR ANYTHING.

444
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,300
UGH, THIS IS GIVING ME
A HEADACHE.

445
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,334
NOW COME ON, YOU GUYS,

446
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,434
WE CAN'T TAKE THIS
DECISION LIGHTLY.

447
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,601
WHOEVER WE PICK
IS GOING TO BE THE PERSON

448
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,100
WE DO EVERYTHING WITH
FROM NOW ON.

449
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,701
YOU'RE RIGHT.

450
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,100
WELL, HOW ABOUT TIMMY ?

451
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,501
HE'S QUIET AND HE TAKES
DIRECTION WELL.

452
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,868
REALLY, THE PERFECT FRIEND.

453
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,300
YEAH, BUT TIMMY CAN BE
REALLY SELF-CENTERED.

454
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,701
HOW ABOUT TOKEN ?

455
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,701
TOKEN'S A SMARTASS.

456
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:43,834
SO,
YOU'RE A SMARTASS.

457
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,267
YEAH, BUT DO WE REALLY
NEED ANOTHER ONE ?

458
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,367
GOOD POINT.

459
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,634
HEY, FELLAS, I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

460
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,968
AND THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
THIS GIFT BASKET.

461
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:51,934
OH, THANKS, JIMMY.

462
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,000
THERE'S SOME CHOCOLATES
AND LICORICE

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
AND SOME GAMES
AND PUZZLES INSIDE.

464
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,601
THAT'S GREAT.
COOL.

465
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,634
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE
SEEING YOU FRIENDS LATER.

466
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,968
ALRIGHT, JIMMY,
SEE YA.

467
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,167
SUCK UP.

468
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,701
NOT LONG NOW,
GENERAL DISARRAY,

469
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:15,167
AND OUR HORRIBLE PLAN
WILL BE COMPLETE.

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,033
HEY, DO YOU THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD BUILD A BOAT ?

471
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,734
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
A LITTLE RAFT OR SOMETHING

472
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,734
SO THAT WHEN
THE WORLD FLOODS,

473
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:24,000
YOU AND ME AND
THE MINIONS CAN LIVE ?

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,767
OH YEAH, I HADN'T
THOUGHT OF THAT.

475
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:26,534
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

476
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,567
I'LL GO GET A HAMMER.

477
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,667
HEY, WHO IS THAT ?

478
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,434
IS THIS IT ?

479
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,100
YEAH, 213,
THAT'S THE ONE.

480
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,200
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?

481
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,200
AH !  YOU MAY HAVE
WON THIS TIME,

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,934
BUT I WILL BE BACK !

483
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,100
WHAT DO WE DO NOW ?

484
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,033
WELL, I HAD ANOTHER IDEA
OF HOW TO KILL THE WORLD.

485
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,968
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALMOST TOO
HORRIBLE TO EVEN SPEAK OF,

486
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,601
BUT NOW THEY'VE LEFT ME
WITH NO OTHER CHOICE !

487
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,200
WELL, THIS IS IT.

488
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,601
WE'VE MADE OUR FINAL DECISION,
AND ONE OF YOU,

489
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,334
IS WHO WE WILL SPENDING
OUR CHILDHOOD WITH,

490
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,467
AS OUR NEW FRIEND.

491
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,334
OH PLEASE...
OH GOD, PLEASE.

492
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,701
FOUR FRIENDS,
JUST ONE ROSE.

493
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,434
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
IS HERE.

494
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,601
KYLE, WHO DOES
THE ROSE GO TO ?

495
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,434
THIS IS IT,
GENERAL DISARRAY--

496
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,734
MY FINAL SOLUTION.

497
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,300
WHAT EVIL PLOT DO YOU HAVE
THIS TIME, PROFESSOR CHAOS ?

498
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
SIMPLE, MY DEAR GENERAL.

499
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,701
WE ARE GOING TO TEAR DOWN THE
EARTH'S PRECIOUS ATMOSPHERE !

500
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,167
OH YES, MY LATEST PLAN
WILL MELT THE POLAR ICE CAPS

501
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:51,133
AND BURN ALL THE WORLD
WITH THE SUN'S HARMFUL RAYS.

502
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,434
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR PRECIOUS
OZONE AND HELLO TO CHAOS !

503
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,801
( pssssssssssss )

504
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,133
OKAY, HAND ME ANOTHER ONE,
GENERAL DISARRAY.

505
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,234
AH HA HA,
HA HA HAA.

506
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,334
HA HA HA !

507
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,567
HAA HA HA HA HAA !

508
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,968
AH HA HA,

509
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,834
HA HA, HA HAA !

510
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,000
( announcer )
WILL PROFESSOR CHAOS'
LATEST PLOT SUCCEED

511
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,033
AND BE THE FINAL
UNDOING OF EARTH ?

512
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:24,734
AND WHICH BOY HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO
BE THE REPLACEMENT FOR KENNY ?

513
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,501
AND WHICH ONE OF THESE SIX
SOUTH PARK RESIDENTS WAS KILLED

514
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,968
AND WILL NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN ?

515
