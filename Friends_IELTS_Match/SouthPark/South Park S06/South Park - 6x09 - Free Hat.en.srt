Oh cool, a preview!

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,599
Coming this summer,

16
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,234
It's the classic film
that changed america.

17
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:42,933
"E.T. The extra-Terrestrial"!

18
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:46,199
The new, redone version
for 2002!

19
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,566
All the e.T. Effects have been
digitally upgraded.

20
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,968
All the guns have been digitally
changed to walkie-Talkies.

21
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:53,267
And the word "terrorist" has
been changed to "hippie".

22
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,532
Aw, dude, why would
they do that?

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,450
Yeah, hippies and terrorists
are the same thing.

24
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,334
No, dude, spielberg changed
terrorist to hippie

25
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,300
To make e.T. More p.C.

26
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:02,232
That's gay.

27
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:03,833
Coming this summer,

28
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,751
It's the motion picture
that changed america.

29
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,877
"Saving private ryan",
the re-Re-Release,

30
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:10,873
Where the word "nazi"
has been changed to

31
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:12,799
"Persons with political
differences".

32
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,701
And all the guns have been
replaced by walkie-Talkies.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Why the hell do these directors
keep updating their movies?!

34
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,300
And now for your
feature presentation!

35
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,365
The classic re-Re-Re-Release

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,267
Of "star wars: the empire
strikes back!

37
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,767
Woo hoo!

38
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,432
Aaaaaghhh!

39
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,883
God dammit,
that pisses me off!

40
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,300
Yeah, we want
our money back!

41
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,867
Sorry, suckers!

42
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,365
You asshole!

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,868
Why don't they leave
those movies alone!

44
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,352
We liked them the way
they were!

45
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:53,766
Don't you see
what this means?

46
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,834
All our favorite movies are
going to be changed and updated

47
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,601
Until we can't even
recognize them anymore!

48
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:58,732
Tweek is right.

49
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,299
It isn't fair for those
asshole directors

50
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,734
To keep changing their movies
and making them different!

51
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,434
Movies are art and art
shouldn't be modified!

52
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:04,718
Yeah, what if
they had modified

53
00:02:04,753 --> 00:02:05,933
The roman colosseum
every year?

54
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:07,734
It would just be another
big "douchie" stadium now!

55
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:08,467
We have to
do something!

56
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,332
Let's form a club!

57
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:10,399
Yeah, we could
form a club

58
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,699
That takes food stamps
from poor people

59
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,234
And then sells them back to
the government for a profit!

60
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,632
No, fat-Ass!

61
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,634
I mean a club to protect
films from their directors

62
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,299
So they can't be
messed with!

63
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,968
Yeah, we'll be the "save films
from their own directors' club".

64
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:21,899
Yeah!

65
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:22,998
No!
No, no!

66
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,601
I don't wanna form a club!
That's too much pressure!

67
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:25,632
Look, i'm supposed to
take it easy.

68
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,399
Just watch the clouds,
sit in the grass.

69
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,100
If we form a club there'll be
responsibilities,

70
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:29,632
Commitments!

71
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,566
Tweek, now god dammit,

72
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,566
We picked you to
replace kenny

73
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,234
Because we thought you were
a team player!

74
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,232
I'm not!

75
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,032
I'm not
a team player!

76
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,501
Now either you stop with
these "faggotronics"

77
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,601
Or we'll find someone
to replace you!

78
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:40,901
Aaagh!
Oh, jesus!

79
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:46,033
Dude, that sign sucks,
nobody's gonna show up!

80
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:47,251
What's wrong with it?

81
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:48,399
Look at it, dude,

82
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,934
You're not offering
any fabulous prizes.

83
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,532
You have to offer
fabulous prizes

84
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,334
If you want people to show up
for your stupid crap.

85
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:54,234
Here...

86
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,666
Free hat?

87
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, if you offer free hats,
maybe people will show up.

88
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,632
But we don't
have hats!

89
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,699
We can make them
out of paper.

90
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,267
It's not hard, just stupid
little paper hats.

91
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,068
People just need free stuff.

92
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,834
Don't you guys
know anything?

93
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:07,998
You see?

94
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,501
First we were just forming a
club, now we have to make hats!

95
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,632
Where does it end?!

96
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:11,834
Alright, let's go get
the gymnasium ready.

97
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:12,567
Tweek, you go make
50 hats.

98
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:14,866
50 hats?
Oh jesus!

99
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll never make it!
I'll never make it!

100
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,299
Tweek!

101
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,833
Calm down, son.

102
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,234
Remember what
dr. Norris told you-

103
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,534
Find your center.

104
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,518
My center?

105
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:25,432
My center.

106
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:29,100
Calm... puppies.

107
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,783
Tweek!

108
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,265
Tweek!

109
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,499
Tweeeeeekk!

110
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,067
How many hats
have you made?

111
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,132
Oh god!

112
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,000
We only have until 10 a.M.
Tomorrow, get the lead out!

113
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,234
Aagh, oh god!

114
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,250
You guys,
we have a big problem!

115
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:51,267
I was up all night
making hats-

116
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:52,599
I only slept for an hour-

117
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:53,334
And then i dreamt about
making hats!

118
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,466
But i only made 15!

119
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,165
Calm down, tweek.
15 might be enough.

120
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,767
Yeah, let's see if anyone's
even shown up yet.

121
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,567
Dude, there's like a thousand
people in there!

122
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:08,132
A thousand?
Oh jesus, man!

123
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't have nearly
a thousand hats!

124
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,033
They're gonna kick
your ass, tweek!

125
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,199
Tweek, it's okay!

126
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,950
Look, maybe these people
all turned out

127
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,632
Because they believe
in saving films!

128
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,467
Maybe they don't even care
about the free hat!

129
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,267
Free hat!
Free hat!...

130
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,165
Oh god!

131
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,265
I told you guys-

132
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,634
Never underestimate
the power of a free hat.

133
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,499
I gotta move away,
you guys!

134
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:27,367
Relax, tweek, we're just gonna
have to go in there

135
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,199
And explain what happened.

136
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,367
There are more important things
right now than free hats.

137
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,132
Okay, uh, we wanna thank you
all for coming.

138
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:40,734
We're really happy to see such
enthusiasm for our cause.

139
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:42,332
Uh, one thing
before i continue:

140
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,534
Unfortunately, we don't have enough
of the free hats for everyone.

141
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,833
Uh, excuse me?

142
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,300
Yes, we apologize,
but our friend tweek here,

143
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,632
Didn't make
enough of them.

144
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,467
Oh jesus, don't
tell them it was me!

145
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,000
We don't care about that.

146
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,165
You don't?

147
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
You mean you just came because
you believe in our cause?

148
00:04:59,135 --> 00:04:59,434
Yeah, free hat!

149
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,265
What?!

150
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,566
Hat mccullough!

151
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,599
He was sent to
prison in '82

152
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,701
And we believe he should
be released!

153
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:06,599
Yeah!

154
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,767
Free hat!
Free hat!...

155
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:12,934
Okay, apparently, there's been
a bit of a misunderstanding.

156
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,868
This is a rally to save films
from their directors.

157
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,299
To do what?

158
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,067
We believe that films are pieces
of art that must be preserved

159
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,400
From the perverse hands
of their aging filmmakers.

160
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,098
Oh... sorry.

161
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,267
Come on, everyone, guess
we're in the wrong place.

162
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,051
Free hat!
Free hat!

163
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,766
Wait, wait, wait!

164
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,232
Don't you see what's happening
out there?

165
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,950
The films that you all grew up
with, that touched your lives

166
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:38,634
And are a part of your soul, are
now being updated and changed.

167
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,434
Join us and we can be a group
that makes a difference!

168
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,934
Can we also work towards
freeing hat?

169
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,400
Uh, sure, and we'll also
try to free hat.

170
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,501
Free hat!
Free hat!...

171
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,350
212, 213, 214 members!

172
00:05:56,385 --> 00:05:58,399
You guys, you guys!

173
00:05:58,434 --> 00:05:59,234
Oh god!
I've got terrible news!

174
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,332
What?

175
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,634
Ted koppel wants us
to appear on "nightline"

176
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:03,618
To talk about our cause!

177
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,026
Really?
That's great!

178
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,365
No, it isn't, man!

179
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,833
That is way
too much pressure!

180
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,334
If we go on nightline, the whole
country can hear about

181
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,051
What's happening to
our classic films!

182
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,734
Just remember that
i do all the talking.

183
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:13,766
You? Why?

184
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,334
Because i'm the
official spokesman.

185
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,532
I got dibs on it.

186
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,032
When did we do
dibs for it?

187
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,167
Just now.
One two three- Dibs!

188
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,666
Knee.

189
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,767
Alright, fine, you're
the spokesman, cartman.

190
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,835
But you better not
screw it up!

191
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,833
What could
possibly go wrong?

192
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,666
A new movement is
sweeping the country,

193
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,867
Led by four determined boys
from south park, colorado.

194
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,801
The organization was created
to protect hollywood's

195
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,701
Classic films from the hands
of their directors,

196
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,766
And also to free
hat mccullough.

197
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,200
So boys, i'll ask you the question
that's on everyone's minds.

198
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,951
Why does your organization want
to free hat mccullough,

199
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,667
The convicted, confessed serial
murderer of 23 babies?

200
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,733
I believe that can
best be answered

201
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,200
By our official
spokesman, tweek.

202
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:54,632
Agh!

203
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,767
Well, hat mccullough admitted
he killed those toddlers,

204
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:58,434
Why do you want him free?

205
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,799
Oh, jesus, man!

206
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,132
Just answer me
this, tweek-

207
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,367
What do you see as positive
about toddler murder?

208
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:09,801
Uh, uh, it's...
it's easy?

209
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,232
Yes, it is easy.

210
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,384
Alright, then on to
your other cause.

211
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,093
"Saving films from
their directors".

212
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,732
What got you boys
interested in this?

213
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,965
Especially given your
pro-Toddler murder status.

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,083
We believe that films have to be
taken away from people like

215
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,167
Steven spielberg and george
lucas because they're insane.

216
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:26,300
I'm glad you said that, boys,
because joining us now

217
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:28,467
Are steven spielberg
and george lucas!

218
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:29,199
Oh christ, agh!

219
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,866
Hello, ted.
Hi, ted.

220
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,650
Gentlemen, these toddler murder
fans think that you're insane

221
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,400
And shouldn't be allowed to
alter your films. Your response?

222
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:37,666
Well, first of all,
both george and i

223
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,901
Are very firmly against
the murdering of toddlers.

224
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:41,866
Hear, hear.

225
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,267
Dude, that's steven spielberg
and george lucas.

226
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:44,432
Get me out of here!

227
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,601
Please somebody get me
out of here!

228
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:46,866
And as for
altering our films,

229
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,550
All we're doing reaching a
new audience with our movies.

230
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,200
As the makers of dreams, we like
to speak for the children.

231
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:55,100
Uh, we thought we were
speaking for the children.

232
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,299
Yeah, we're children.

233
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,634
Look, if the beatles went back
and updated "the white album"

234
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,432
Every few years,
what would we have now?

235
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah, these guys are only
motivated by money, ted.

236
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:03,532
How so?

237
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,433
Think about it-
Jew.

238
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,951
Jew.
Jew.

239
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,393
Coincidence?

240
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,766
I'm not a jew!

241
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,968
You little brats- I mean,
you darling children

242
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,766
Don't know what
you're talking about.

243
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:16,267
Changing e.T. Was the
best thing i ever did.

244
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:17,732
Dude, don't you see
that it's not?

245
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,200
It'd be like changing
"raiders of the lost ark"!

246
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,367
Wait a minute,
what did you say?

247
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,732
That's brilliant!

248
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,050
Yes, change raiders
of the lost ark,

249
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:27,334
Why didn't we
think of it before?

250
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,200
No! No!

251
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:35,766
Members, this is our
darkest hour.

252
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,484
We have just learned that
george lucas and steven spielberg

253
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,167
Now intend to update and change
"raiders of the lost ark".

254
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,167
There is only one way we can
stop this important,

255
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:46,367
Historical piece of art
from being harmed.

256
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,668
Mr. Secretary?

257
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,899
Thank you.

258
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:50,567
Our intelligence tells us that
the original negative

259
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:51,833
To raiders of the lost ark

260
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,667
Is currently somewhere
in george lucas' house.

261
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,484
We need to find
and usurp that negative.

262
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,267
And if we can get a hold
of the negative,

263
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,451
They can't change
the movie?

264
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,566
That's our
understanding.

265
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:01,632
Sounds like
a good idea to me!

266
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,400
I don't want them to change
raiders of the lost ark!

267
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,899
Yeah!

268
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:07,901
We should get that negative
as soon as we get hat free!

269
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:08,933
Yeah!

270
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:10,332
Free hat!
Free hat!

271
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,100
No, no, we need to do
this first.

272
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,766
But we have to free hat.

273
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,834
It's just that, you know,
he killed 23 babies.

274
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:19,067
Yeah, but it was
in self-Defense!

275
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:20,332
Yeah!
Yeah!

276
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,998
He killed 23 babies
in self-Defense?

277
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:25,400
Hat was attacked maliciously
and unprovoked

278
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:27,334
By a gang of babies
in westown park.

279
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,234
When that many babies
get together

280
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,766
They can be like piranha.

281
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:32,732
Three eyewitnesses
testified that

282
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,634
If hat hadn't killed those
babies, they'd a killed him!

283
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,265
Yeah!
Free hat! Free hat!

284
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
Alright, but right now
we gotta focus on

285
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:41,501
Getting those original
prints of raiders.

286
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:42,998
He's right,
we better split up.

287
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,367
Some of you go with the boys
to get those film prints,

288
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:46,699
The rest come with me

289
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,067
To go talk to the governor
about freeing hat!

290
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:49,632
Yeah!

291
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,834
Free hat!
Free hat!...

292
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, looks like we're gonna
have to do this ourselves.

293
00:09:58,435 --> 00:09:59,899
No, that's it!
I'm out!

294
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,734
I can't deal with the stress
you guys create!

295
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:02,984
We're just gonna
fly to california

296
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,200
And break into george
lucas' house-

297
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,801
What's stressful
about that?

298
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:06,699
Aagh!

299
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:08,032
Okay, tweek, let me
tell you something.

300
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,683
You've been our new friend now
for two weeks, okay?

301
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,192
And i've gotta be honest with
you, it isn't going well.

302
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:12,667
People aren't that into you,
tweek, they find you annoying.

303
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,351
Now i'd say you've got
one last shot here,

304
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,310
And i don't want you
to blow it, okay?

305
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,234
Does that help take
the stress off?

306
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,200
Okay, go.

307
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:27,150
I'm not breaking into
george lucas' house.

308
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,267
I'm not breaking
into george lucas' house.

309
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:30,599
I'm in a green field.

310
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,300
Shut up, tweek, this is not
the time for "faggocity"!

311
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:35,217
This looks like
the right room.

312
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:38,100
I'm in a field,
surrounded by deer.

313
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:38,234
Over here!

314
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,399
That's it!

315
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:50,934
Alright,
get it, tweek!

316
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,098
Nu-Uh!

317
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,432
Get it,
you piece of crap

318
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,033
Before i grab your nutsack
and twist it!

319
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,650
What are you doing?!

320
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,032
Oh god!
Oh jesus!

321
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,934
You're the boys from
that stupid club!

322
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:04,699
Gimme that!

323
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,566
Do with us
what you will, mr. Lucas,

324
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,100
But please don't change
raiders of the lost ark.

325
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,132
We're gonna
make it better.

326
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,634
The movie is gonna be changed
and that is that!

327
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,632
Alright, you asked for it.

328
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,634
I'm afraid you
leave us no choice!

329
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:16,200
It's time for plan b.!

330
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,265
Aw, really?

331
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,632
Oh god,
not plan b.!

332
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,567
You have a heart
made of ice, mr. Lucas,

333
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:23,467
So we're going to
melt your icy heart

334
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,467
With a cool island song.

335
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:26,934
Gentlemen?

336
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,499
What?!

337
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:31,267
Hit it, tweek!

338
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:36,267
* in the tropical isles
with the coconut trees- *

339
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:37,599
Wait, wait!

340
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:38,400
I thought we were gonna
cool his hot heart

341
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:40,134
With a cool island song.

342
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,799
No, he has a icy heart.

343
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,868
But you can't melt ice with
a cool song, r-Tard!

344
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,334
So we have to warm
his icy heart

345
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,734
With a hot
island song?

346
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,065
It's a cool island song!

347
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,634
Then we're gonna end up
freezing his hellish heart

348
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:50,918
With a cool island song.

349
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,277
Aw, do we wanna
do that?

350
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,601
Alright, that does it!

351
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,365
Yes, thank you,
officer.

352
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,632
The police are
on their way, boys.

353
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,501
Soon you'll be in jail
getting rammed!

354
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:01,833
Aagh!

355
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,418
Those rams can do to us what
they will, mr. Lucas,

356
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:04,968
But we'll never stop
trying to protect films!

357
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,167
It's not too late
to do what's right.

358
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,532
Give us the print.

359
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,133
There's still some good
in you, mr. Lucas,

360
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:11,466
We know there is!

361
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,950
It is... too late
for me, boys.

362
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,365
You yourself
led the campaign

363
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,866
Against the colorization
of films.

364
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,467
You understand why films
shouldn't be changed!

365
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,365
That's different.

366
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,032
These are my movies,
i made them,

367
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,767
And i have the right to do
whatever i want with them.

368
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:28,799
You're wrong,
mr. Lucas.

369
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,200
They're not your movies,
they're ours.

370
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:32,232
All of ours.

371
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,632
We paid to go see them,

372
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,167
And they're just as much a part
of our lives

373
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:36,301
As they are of yours.

374
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,365
When an artist creates,

375
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,133
Whatever they create
belongs to society.

376
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,232
Have i...
become so old

377
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:46,265
That i've forgotten what
being an artist is about?

378
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,667
Give the print to us so that we
can protect it from spielberg

379
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,234
And anyone else
who wants to alter it.

380
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,834
Perhaps...
you are right.

381
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:55,365
Stop!

382
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,968
What are you
doing, george?

383
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,399
Steven, i-

384
00:12:59,434 --> 00:13:00,365
Give me that print,
george.

385
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
We need to make
the alterations.

386
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:05,965
Steven, these boys
had a point.

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,667
I don't remember what
it was, but it was good.

388
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,651
You haven't let these
doe-Eyed children

389
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,601
Affect your judgment,
have you, george?

390
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:15,167
Don't forget-
You belong to me.

391
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,965
Don't listen to him!

392
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,667
You still have a chance to
preserve your film!

393
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,567
I'm...
i'm sorry, boys.

394
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,165
Ha ha ha-Haaaa!

395
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
Now, take the children
prisoner!

396
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,065
What?!

397
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,165
You troublemakers shall be
my guests of honor

398
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,767
At the premiere of the new
raiders of the lost ark!

399
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:41,951
Your gay little club
is over!

400
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,810
You,
steven spielberg!

401
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:45,599
Come on, you guys!

402
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,200
Oh my god, they're
gonna kill us!

403
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,732
Don't even
think about it, kid!

404
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:51,632
I'm not afraid to use
this walkie-Talkie.

405
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,200
The one with the cocaine
problem escaped, mein director!

406
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:55,165
Leave him!

407
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,833
Let him run back
to his mommy.

408
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:58,234
We must get the film ready
for the premiere.

409
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,200
Lucas! Come!

410
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,766
It's the digitally
re-Enhanced re-Release

411
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,550
Of the very first, pilot episode
of "south park"!

412
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,300
Yes, the classic, rough,
hand-Made first episode

413
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,899
Is getting a makeover
for 2002!

414
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:18,400
The simple, funny aliens are now
super bad-Ass and cool!

415
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,766
The flying saucer?

416
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,000
No longer cheap construction
paper- But a 4.0 megapixel

417
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,567
Non-Drop digital masterpiece
of technology!

418
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,300
Yes, everything's new.
New is better!

419
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:28,699
When we first made
south park,

420
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,234
We didn't want to use
construction paper,

421
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,098
We just had to
because it was cheap.

422
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,701
Now with new technology we can
finally re-Master south park

423
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:37,067
To make it look sharp,
clean and focused.

424
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:38,666
And expensive.

425
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,767
Yes, all the charm of
the simple little cartoon

426
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,199
Will melt before your eyes

427
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,367
As it is replaced by newer and
more standardized animation!

428
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,965
For instance, the scene
at the bus stop.

429
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,501
We always meant to have imperial
walkers and giant dewback lizards

430
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:53,100
In the background, but
simply couldn't afford it.

431
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:54,866
Get this special enhanced
version quick!

432
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:58,534
Because another enhanced version
will likely be coming out for 2003!

433
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,466
Members!

434
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,933
Uh, oh jesus-
You have to do something!

435
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,351
Our club's president, treasurer,
and secretary

436
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:09,734
Have all been taken hostage
by steven spielberg!

437
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,998
Agh!

438
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,234
Prisoner?
You mean like hat?

439
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,833
Yes, just like hat!

440
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:15,634
But the governor
won't pardon hat,

441
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,400
So how can we get him
out of prison?

442
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,132
Yeah!

443
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,933
No, listen to me!

444
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,767
We're not talking about
hat right now, okay?

445
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:24,566
Get it?!

446
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,666
Look, we went to
george lucas' house

447
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,467
And tried to melt his icy heart
with a warm island song,

448
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,732
But then spielberg showed up

449
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:32,165
And took three of
our members prisoner!

450
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,067
They're going to premiere the
new raiders of the lost ark

451
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:37,200
And we have to rescue them,
do you understand?!

452
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,732
Hey, he's got
a point there.

453
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:43,367
Yeah, maybe we could melt
the governor's icy heart

454
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,300
With a cool
island song!

455
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,701
Yeah!
Let's go!

456
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:47,651
No!

457
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,532
No?

458
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,899
No, he's right.

459
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:52,500
We have to freeze his hot heart
with a cool island song!

460
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,401
Or is it freshen his hot temper
with a cool island song?

461
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,267
Let's cool his hot temper
with a fresh island song!

462
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,601
That's it!

463
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,334
Oh god, i'm gonna have to
do this myself!

464
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:06,599
Oh god!

465
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,834
Well, the print is finished
and the day has come!

466
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,632
Tonight, steven spielberg
and george lucas

467
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,000
Will be at the premiere of
the new, special edition

468
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,432
Of raiders of the lost ark.

469
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,517
Lots of celebrity guests
and other rich people

470
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:18,567
Will be on hand to witness
all the updated effects

471
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,968
And modernized technology!

472
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,383
Ho-Oh!

473
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:40,532
The kid?

474
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,265
The tweeked-Out kid?

475
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,467
I'm gonna blow up
the print, spielberg!

476
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,933
Your persistence
surprises even me.

477
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,384
Surely you don't think you can
escape from this premiere?

478
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:56,801
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

479
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:58,801
All i want
are my friends.

480
00:16:58,836 --> 00:16:59,732
Wow...

481
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,200
Except for cartman,
you can keep him.

482
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,466
Ah!

483
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:03,799
And if we refuse?

484
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,200
Then your premiere
has no movie!

485
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,100
He's definitely
lost it.

486
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,299
Yup.

487
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:09,601
Okay, okay,
stand back.

488
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:10,833
Stand back, back!

489
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:14,033
Okay, kid, you win,
blow it up.

490
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:17,034
<i>Zuroch!
Zuroch!</i>

491
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,965
Blow it back to god.

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,067
All your life has been the
pursuit of seeing a great film.

493
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:25,434
This new version of raiders
has digital effects

494
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:27,399
Beyond your wildest dreams.

495
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:31,133
You want to see it screened
just as much as i.

496
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,566
Come on, tweek,
blow it up!

497
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:36,567
Son, we are simply passing
through history.

498
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,968
This- Is improved history.

499
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:48,367
Do as you will.

500
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:56,418
* in the tropical isles
with the coconut trees *

501
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:59,833
* the air is fresh and
the people are free *

502
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,734
* but here in the mountains
there's no freedom like that *

503
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:05,467
* there's a man in prison
and his name is hat *

504
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,699
<i>Haffaaa mali fi!</i>

505
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,767
Thanks for coming,
everyone!

506
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,367
This is the birth
of the new version

507
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,432
Of raiders
of the lost ark!

508
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,767
We shall screen it here
and then destroy

509
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:38,400
All the old prints
in celebration!

510
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,933
Hooray!

511
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:41,734
Begin the film!

512
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,166
Ohh, aaahh!

513
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,998
You guys!

514
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,968
Close your eyes,
don't look at it!

515
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,866
What?

516
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:52,450
Don't watch the movie,
you guys!

517
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,000
It'll be terrible,
close your eyes!

518
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:55,918
Oohhh...
aahh...

519
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:57,801
It's beautiful!

520
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,499
Wait a minute.

521
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:06,917
This version
is awful!

522
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:08,265
Yeah, they ruined it!

523
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,067
Oh my god,
it's terrible!

524
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,534
Aaaagh!

525
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:00,133
You...
you guys okay?

526
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:02,098
Yeah, i think so.

527
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:06,234
Man, that new version
must've sucked balls.

528
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:15,632
Today is a day
of celebration!

529
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,067
And we owe it all to these
four brave, young boys!

530
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:21,332
Yeah!
Alright!

531
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,734
And thanks to the bravery of
this young man in particular-

532
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,067
Hat mccullough is finally
free from prison!

533
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:31,899
What?

534
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,965
Hat! Hat! Hat!...

535
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,065
Thank you, everyone-
Kill the innocent!

536
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,367
Uh, i'm so thankful for all your
support- Rape the virgin!

537
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:45,634
And uh, i just wonder if i could
get a baby real quick?

538
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,467
Sure, give that
man a baby!

539
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,334
Come on, you guys,
let's get outta here.

540
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:54,799
Oh my god!

541
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,384
Do you think we did
a good thing, stan?

542
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,393
I mean, no one even
seemed to notice.

543
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,367
Yeah, well, sometimes
the things we do

544
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:02,599
Don't matter right now.

545
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,965
Sometimes they matter
later.

546
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,098
We have to care more about later
sometimes, you know?

547
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,300
I think that's what separates us
from the steven spielbergs

548
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,301
And george lucases
of the world.

549
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,835
That and youth-
Those guys are old.

550
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,334
But what about the
original prints

551
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,165
Of raiders
of the lost ark?!

552
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,601
What if somebody else takes
them and tries to change them?

553
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,568
Don't worry, tweek,
it's somewhere safe,

554
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,501
Somewhere where nobody
will ever find it.
