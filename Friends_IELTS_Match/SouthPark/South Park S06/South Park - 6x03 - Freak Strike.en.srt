Today on the maury povich show:

15
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,893
These poor,
unfortunate people

16
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:37,499
All have horrible
disfigurements.

17
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,400
And we won't believe
how we exploit them

18
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:40,766
For your amusement!

19
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:42,133
That sounds pretty good.

20
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:43,634
Hey, kenny!

21
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,899
That's awesome,
kenny.

22
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:49,200
Now, gosh darn it, fellas,
my name's not kenny.

23
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,284
Kenny's dead.

24
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,299
Okay, not-Kenny.

25
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:52,934
And i'm not gonna wear
this coat anymore neither.

26
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,934
I should be able to
be you guys' friend

27
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,199
Without wearing
kenny's old coat.

28
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,534
Be quiet, not-Kenny, the maury
povich freak show is on.

29
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,199
Oh, all right then.

30
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,834
Our next guest
is a little girl

31
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:02,434
Who was born without
a midsection.

32
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,200
Please welcome
damla jones.

33
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,967
Hello, maury.

34
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,566
Ah, sick, dude!

35
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,200
You're a very brave
little girl,

36
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:11,968
And i'm very proud of you.

37
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:13,032
Thank you.

38
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,267
Can you tell the audience
how miserable your life is?

39
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:17,532
Ah, yes, it is.

40
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:18,866
Ha ha,
you're a cutie.

41
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,334
Do the other kids at school
sometimes make fun of you?

42
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:22,632
Sometimes.

43
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,300
Do people sometimes
stare at you?

44
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,766
Sometimes.

45
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,400
Do they go, "oh gross,
what the hell is that thing?"

46
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:29,632
I don't know.

47
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,267
Well, your mommy told us
you like to listen to music.

48
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,365
Yes?

49
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,632
Well, guess what, damla,

50
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,434
We're gonna give you
a $300 gift certificate

51
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,332
<i>To cd world in torrance.</i>

52
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,299
All right, everyone,
stay tuned,

53
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,067
Because next we're
gonna meet a woman

54
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,718
Whose head was smashed in
on a logger.

55
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:46,334
And we're gonna
give her a makeover!

56
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:48,098
This is terrible, dude.

57
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,067
Maury povich parades these people
on his show like carnival freaks.

58
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,267
Then gives them prizes at
the end as if to justify it.

59
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,834
What a dick.

60
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,866
Dude, one of us should
make up some disease

61
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,968
And get on the maury povich show
so we can get a prize.

62
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:05,802
Cool!

63
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:06,566
Oh yes!

64
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,666
That'd be
awesome.

65
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,017
Do you think
they'll believe it?

66
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,359
What disease
should we say?

67
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,632
Shh, be quiet,
you guys.

68
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,967
Hello, is this
maury povich?

69
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,267
Oh, well, who
the hell are you?

70
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,032
Oh.

71
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, i'm calling about
your ad for freaks.

72
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,918
Right, i mean people
with disabilities.

73
00:02:20,953 --> 00:02:22,626
Yeah, i have a friend,
he has a deformity,

74
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,300
I think he'd be perfect
for your show.

75
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,132
Great!

76
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,566
His condition?

77
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,167
Ah, he has a condition
called "chin-Ball-Alitis".

78
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:32,501
Yes, his balls actually
hang from his chin.

79
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,199
Shut up, you guys.

80
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,901
Yes, yes, of course,
he's very upset about it.

81
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:40,133
Yes, he cries
all the time.

82
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,599
Miserable, uh-Huh.

83
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,032
You wa- Really?
What?

84
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,200
Dude, they say they'll fly him
out the day after tomorrow.

85
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:46,232
Awesome!
Cool!

86
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,868
Yes, i'm sure i can convince
him to come on the show.

87
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,101
There will of course
be a prize involved?

88
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,300
Great, i'll call you
back in an hour.

89
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,167
<i>No, thank you.</i>

90
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:55,332
Yes!

91
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,601
This is gonna
be so funny!

92
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,965
It sure is!

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,767
But how are we gonna get the
balls put on butters' chin?

94
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,334
Yeah, how we gonna-
Wait, butters' chin?

95
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:03,399
Yeah.

96
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,599
But that's me,
i'm butters.

97
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,284
We know, you're the one
doing it, butters.

98
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,776
Who'd you think
we were talking about?

99
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,199
Well, hold on
just a second, you guys.

100
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,968
Hey, i know how we get
the balls on butters' chin.

101
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,566
Those "star trek" dorks
down the street.

102
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,334
They're always making crazy
masks and special effects

103
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:15,334
For their dumb movies.

104
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,766
Hang on now.

105
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,467
Yeah, i bet they could make
a fake set of balls.

106
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,165
Come on, butters.

107
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,466
Wait, why does it
have to be me?

108
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,133
It has to be you, butters,
think about it.

109
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:22,899
Yeah.

110
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,567
But fellas, if i go
on maury povich

111
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:25,866
With my balls on my chin

112
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,834
My parents are gonna
be really mad.

113
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:28,566
We'll just
tell your parents

114
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,667
We're going on a camping trip
with my parents.

115
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:30,732
They'll never know.

116
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:31,734
I'm sorry,
but the answer is-

117
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:34,084
Unh-Uh, unh-Uh, unh-Uh.

118
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:36,365
Kenny would've done it.

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,367
So? I told you guys before,
i'm not kenny.

120
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:42,466
We know, believe me,
we know.

121
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,267
We're reminded every day
that you're not kenny

122
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,532
Because kenny was cool.

123
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,501
Yeah, god, i wish kenny
was still alive.

124
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:49,284
He'd put balls on his chin.

125
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,033
He was such
an awesome friend.

126
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,866
Well, come on, guys.

127
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,234
If butters won't even put
balls on his chins for us

128
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,501
I guess we know
where we stand.

129
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,866
Yeah.

130
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:01,467
Ah, gee whiz, you promise my
mom and dad won't find out?

131
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:05,033
Now, we're going to apply the
latex with some spirit gum.

132
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,917
That spirit gum
sure is stinky.

133
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:08,843
Where'd you get
the balls from?

134
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,699
We made a plaster mold
of his chin

135
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:13,501
And then made a latex scrotum
and put two golf balls inside.

136
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,766
Nice.

137
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:17,367
Now, we just blend
the skin tones,

138
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:19,934
Add a little hair
and presto!

139
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,032
Wow!

140
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,284
That looks
awesome!

141
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,466
Oh, i feel silly.

142
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,934
They look great
on you, butters,

143
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:25,666
They really do.

144
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,833
I believe you
owe us payment now.

145
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,634
<i>All right, the original avid
cut of "star wars episode one".</i>

146
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,899
Wow, they weren't
lying!

147
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,267
Why the hell would they
want that anyway?

148
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:35,799
Episode one
sucked balls.

149
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,234
Yeah, it sucked hairy
butters' chin balls.

150
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:40,799
Hey, hey,
stop it, man!

151
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,634
Gay air flight 243
with service to new york,

152
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,034
Now ready for
general boarding.

153
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,318
That's your flight,

00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,532
Okay, here's your ticket.

155
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,767
And they're gonna have
a car waiting for you

156
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:49,965
At the gate in new york.

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Wait, you guys aren't
coming with me?

158
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:52,466
Hell no, dude.

159
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,766
Then we couldn't
watch you on tv.

160
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:54,534
Hold on a minute, guys,
i change my mind.

161
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,065
I don't want to go.

162
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,367
God, the isn't butters awesome

163
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,499
Yeah, he sure is.

164
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,400
Doing all this to
bring us back a prize.

165
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,651
What a great friend.

166
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:04,833
Butters, butters!

167
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:07,667
All right then,

168
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,534
Thanks for coming

169
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,434

Until we call for you

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
Wow, scooped-Out-Face-Guy.

177
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,466
I've seen you
on tv before.

178
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,217
Yes, this is my
sixth appearance.

179
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,899
I'll come back
in a bit, folks.

180
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,334
Hey, roger, what the hell
is with these

181
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,299
Horrible
veggie platters?

182
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, we told you last time
we want fresher vegetables.

183
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,965
I'm sorry, this is what
the studio provides.

184
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Just take a seat on the couch,
kid, i'll be back in a minute.

185
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,867
Boy-With-Balls-
On-His-Chin?

186
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,766
Haven't seen you
around.

187
00:05:58,801 --> 00:05:59,434
How long you been
on the circuit?

188
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,299
What circuit?

189
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,399
The talk show
circuit.

190
00:06:02,434 --> 00:06:03,799
Don't tell us this is
your first one.

191
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,834
Well yeah, you've all done it
more than once?

192
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,767
Oprah two times,
jenny jones once,

193
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,299
Sally jessy five times.

194
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,265
You've only done
jenny once?

195
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,998
I hate doing
the jenny jones show.

196
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,133
They don't even have
their own hair people.

197
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,399
I'm doing
jenny tomorrow.

198
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:17,367
Yeah, you picked a good
show to do first, kid.

199
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,566
But you need to
learn the ropes.

200
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:20,634
There are a lot of people like
you all over the country,

201
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,701
And we all do talk shows
for a living.

202
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:23,833
We all know each other,

203
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:24,899
And we all kind of
stick together

204
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,199
To make sure our
industry is protected.

205
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,367
Yeah, like when someone
lies about being a freak.

206
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,699
Oh, they,
they do, huh?

207
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,065
Yeah, they'll make up
a fake condition

208
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,801
<i>To go on these shows and
then take our money away.</i>

209
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:38,267
We don't take
kindly to that.

210
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:40,566
I can certainly see why.

211
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,466
It's okay, folks
don't do it anymore.

212
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,567
Not after they saw what
we did to lobster boy.

213
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,799
Lobster boy?

214
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,033
Yeah, lobster boy used to
make appearances

215
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,232
On all the talk shows.

216
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,367
He was one of the most popular
disfigured people on tv.

217
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,899
But then one day
we all found out

218
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,734
That lobster boy wasn't
a real freak at all.

219
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,334
He was just an
actual lobster.

220
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,666
Lying sack of crap.

221
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:03,300
So you know what
we did to him?

222
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,232
What?

223
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,067
One night all us
freaks got together

224
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,667
And we boiled him alive.

225
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,566
Now lobster boy
is no more.

226
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,033
Oh, yeah, i hate when people
fake conditions too.

227
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,217
Those stupid fakers.

228
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:23,332
We're glad you agree.

229
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:26,033
Okay, boy-With-Balls-
On-His-Chin,

230
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,566
You're up next.

231
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,067
Oh, jesus,
see me through this.

232
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,532
Today on the
maury povich show

233
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,501
We bring back some of our
favorite disfigured people

234
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:38,167
And introduce you
to some new ones.

235
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:38,833
Here he comes!

236
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:40,098
This is gonna
be awesome!

237
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,699
Our next guest suffers
from a rare birth defect

238
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:45,334
Which caused his testicles and
scrotum to grow from his chin.

239
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,965
Testicles and scrotum!

240
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,634
Please welcome 8½-Year-Old
napoleon bonaparte

241
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,267
From south park, colorado.

242
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,667
Thanks so much for
coming on our show.

243
00:07:57,702 --> 00:07:59,399
Oh, that's okay,
i suppose.

244
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:02,200
So, is it tough
being... different?

245
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:03,766
Ah, yeah.

246
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,200
And do all the kids at school
make fun of you?

247
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,866
They sure do!

248
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,300
They always say to me,
"butters, you're not kenny."

249
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,666
But i never said
i was kenny.

250
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,534
They say kenny would do this,
and kenny would do that-

251
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,866
Uh-Oh,
we're losing him.

252
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,466
I'm tired of it.
You hear me, fellas?

253
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,601
Kenny's dead, and you
just have to deal with it.

254
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,566
Ah, yeah, but i mean,

255
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,100
Do the kids at school
make fun of you

256
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,234
Because of your
condition?

257
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,499
What condition?

258
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,801
You have balls that
hang off your chin.

259
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:27,766
I do?!

260
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,599
Oh, oh, i mean
yeah, i do.

261
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,033
Yeah, the kids at school
make fun of me for that.

262
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:32,833
That was close.

263
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,767
What names do they
call you at school?

264
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:37,299
Oh well, i guess
they call me

265
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:41,332
Chin-Ball-Boy...
and ball-Chin-Boy.

266
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,300
When i'm walking they'll say,
"hey, there goes chin balls."

267
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,601
And do they call you
freak and weirdo?

268
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:51,566
Yeah, i suppose.

269
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,632
And do they point at you
and laugh?

270
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,367
Do they make you wish
you'd never been born?

271
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,499
Make you wish
to put an end

272
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,300
To the whole miserable
wretched earth?!

273
00:08:58,335 --> 00:08:59,399
Uh, sure.

274
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,367
Well, napoleon, we have
a surprise for you.

275
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:03,934
Wait, here it is,
here it is.

276
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:04,899
The presents!

277
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:07,384
Because you're such a brave
little chin-Ball-Man

278
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,799
We're gonna send you
directly from this studio

279
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,300
To the world's largest putt-Putt
golf course in the world.

280
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,767
Oh really?

281
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,032
Wow.

282
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,265
Did he say
the largest

283
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,701
Putt-Putt golf course
in the world?

284
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,200
Go on, you're
going right now.

285
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,399
But that's not fair.

286
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,501
That means butters
gets to go and we don't.

287
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,632
Yeah, we thought up
the whole thing.

288
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,400
Once again butters is
trying to screw us over.

289
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,699
That asshole!

290
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,265
Hello, is this the
maury povich show?

291
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,934
Yes, hello, i'm calling because
i saw your television program

292
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,351
And i also have balls
hanging from my chin.

293
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,734
I'd like to come on and
talk about my disorder

294
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,933
And perhaps
get a free trip

295
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,301
To the largest putt-Putt
golf course in the world.

296
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,634
I'm sorry, but we're done
doing freak shows for now.

297
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,534
We're looking for people
for a new topic.

298
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:46,866
What's the new topic?

299
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,667
"Please help my
out-Of-Control child."

300
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:50,901
Oh... hey,
i'm out of control.

301
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:51,866
Really?

302
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,184
Is your mother
in tears every day

303
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,467
Over how disobedient
you are?

304
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:55,732
Uh, sure.

305
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,467
Does she worry about you
doing drugs and having sex

306
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:58,632
At such a young age?

307
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,501
Yeah, sure, i do crack and
potpourri and greasies.

308
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,732
Well, that's great.

309
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,200
If you can get your mom
to come on with you

310
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,868
We'd love to fly you out.

311
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,467
My, my mom?

312
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,199
Mom...

313
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,466
Yeah, sweetie?

314
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,101
Could you
do me a favor?

315
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,666
What's that,
my little man?

316
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,098
Could you go on the
maury povich show with me

317
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,300
And say that i'm out of control
and do drugs and have sex

318
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,599
So that i can
go to the largest

319
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:23,432
Putt-Putt golf course
in the world?

320
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,767
Mmm, but you're not
out of control, muffin.

321
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,484
You're my perfect
little gumdrop.

322
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,167
I'm just asking you
to lie for me.

323
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:29,601
You love me, don't you?

324
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,299
Of course i do.

325
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,400
Oh, i have such a
pretty mother.

326
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:33,901
Such a wonderful mother.

327
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:34,902
Sweetie, don't.

328
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,833
Then it's settled.

329
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,300
Oh, i've got
such a great mother,

330
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,132
Such a beautiful mother.

331
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,334
Just what did you think
you were doing, butters?

332
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:42,766
Not only did you lie to us

333
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,450
And say you were on a camping
trip with kyle's family,

334
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:48,100
You made a fool of yourself
and us on national television.

335
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:49,165
I'm sorry, mom.

336
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,232
Well, sorry isn't gonna
make it this time, mister.

337
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,000
Y'know, your grandmother saw
the show and had a mild stroke.

338
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,267
Oh gee, i didn't mean
to almost kill grandma.

339
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,934
I promise i'll never
go on tv

340
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,532
With balls
on my chin again.

341
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,300
Uh! You better believe
you won't, buster.

342
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,118
Your father and i
have to leave now

343
00:11:03,153 --> 00:11:04,866
To visit grandma
in the hospital.

344
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,634
But you can just take
those balls off your chin

345
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:07,334
And march right up
to your room.

346
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:09,767
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:12,933
Serves me right.

348
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,567
Putting balls on my chin
and lying about it.

349
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:16,599
Why, i should be grounded
for a month.

350
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,300
Why do i do these things?
Why can't i behave myself?

351
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,868
Hey, butters, those other
freak people from the show

352
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,200
Were just over here
looking for you.

353
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:25,499
Oh jesus!
They were?

354
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,967
Yeah, they wanted to
find you bad.

355
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,468
Ohh, god,
what'd you tell them?

356
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:29,899
I told them
where to find you.

357
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,599
What, why the heck
would you do that?

358
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:34,167
They wanna kill me for
not being a real freak.

359
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:35,132
Oh...

360
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,300
Well, serves you right
for screwing us over.

361
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,299
Oh jesus, no.

362
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,067
They've come to
boil me alive,

363
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,584
Just like lobster boy.

364
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:50,032
I gotta get
out of here.

365
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,400
Wait, i can't go anywhere,
i'm grounded.

366
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,100
Oh christ,
what a pickle.

367
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,399
Napoleon?

368
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,684
Napoleon bonaparte?

369
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,899
I think he's up here.

370
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,965
Oh, hello, folks,
what's the problem?

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,550
There you are, boy-With-
Balls-On-His-Chin.

372
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:14,100
We've got big news-
The union is striking.

373
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,632
The union?

374
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,632
Oh, that's why you came?

375
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,734
We're tired of our
crappy prizes,

376
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:19,732
So the union president,

377
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,650
Man-With-Terrible-
Skin-Condition,

378
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,499
Has told us to
round everyone up.

379
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,367
I can't freak-Strike, fellas,
i'm grounded.

380
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:27,799
Grounded for what?

381
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,267
For having balls on my-
I mean, nothing.

382
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:31,599
I'm not grounded.

383
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,934
Good, then you can
march with us.

384
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,267
Freaks of the world
unite!

385
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,232
Today on maury povich,

386
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,167
These moms don't know what to do
with their out-Of-Control kids.

387
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:44,501
Young boys and girls
so whorish on our show

388
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,400
That it borders on
child pornography!

389
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,065
We're here
talking with moms

390
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,632
Who think their children
are out of control.

391
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,167
Now, vanessa here says that her
13-Year-Old daughter vanity

392
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:58,067
Is already doing drugs and
having sex with older men.

393
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,965
Whoa...

394
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,033
Vanessa, what does
vanity say to you

395
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:05,067
When you tell her to
do her homework?

396
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,418
She says
she hates me.

397
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,699
She calls me retard.

398
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:12,100
Then she says my cooze
is all dried up

399
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,200
And nobody wants it.

400
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:16,699
Aww!

401
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,133
Well, let's
bring her out.

402
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,400
Here's vanity!

403
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,965
Whatever, whatever.

404
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,634
You
suckers don't know.

405
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,267
You!

406
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:34,734
Wow, vanity, you are really
an out-Of-Control teen.

407
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,265
Yeah!

408
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,067
Maury! Maury!

409
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:38,799
Whatever!

410
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,634
Maury, my mom don't
know.

411
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:41,699
You can ax her.

412
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:43,400
I ax all my homies
if they be down with it.

413
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:45,467
Y'know, it's all
good,.

414
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,432
You,
suckers!

415
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:50,632
Jeez, that girl
is pissed off.

416
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,917
Okay, cartman family,
you're on in two minutes.

417
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:57,167
Why can't you just
listen to me and love me?

418
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,098
Shut up!

419
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,998
Shut the up,
you dried up skank!

420
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:03,183
I'm glad you're not
like that, poopsy-Kins.

421
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,334
But if i'm not the most
out-Of-Control teen

422
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:08,299
I might not win
the prize.

423
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:09,267
Excuse me, i want to
make a quick change.

424
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:11,232
Where's wardrobe?

425
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,167
Second door
on the right.

426
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,734
Strike! Strike!...

427
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,184
Brothers and sisters,
the time has come for us

428
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,560
To be treated with
the respect we deserve!

429
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:27,148
We're a strong and diverse
group of people,

430
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:29,701
With members like
woman-With-Crab-Like-Body,

431
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,918
Incredibly-Obese-
Black-Person,

432
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,100
Man-With-Brains-
Outside-Of-Head

433
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,866
And liza minelli.

434
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:39,000
The talk shows have us on and
gives us little gifts and perks

435
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:43,265
While they make tens of
thousands of dollars!

436
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,900
We told the talk shows our
demands and they laughed!

437
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,501
They say they can get plenty
of other stupid guests

438
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:49,766
To go on their shows,

439
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,998
So we must picket
those other guests.

440
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,767
Oh, gosh, i need to go,
i can't picket, guys.

441
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:57,699
You're not gonna
picket?

442
00:14:57,734 --> 00:15:00,033
Who's not gonna picket?

443
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,833
Boy-With-Balls-On-Chin
doesn't want to picket.

444
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,634
It's just that parents are-
I can't picket.

445
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,367
Why, you're not
a scab, are you?

446
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:10,365
No, i'm not a scab.

447
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,634
Now, we will split up
into groups

448
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,032
And form picket lines.

449
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,934
The first group will be led by
incredibly-Obese-Black-Man.

450
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:19,634
Excuse me, i'm not
incredibly-Obese-Black-Man.

451
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,634
I'm incredibly-Black-Obese-Man.

452
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,165
Oh, right, my bad.

453
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,434
And now, back to more kids
who are out of control

454
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,365
On the maury povich show!

455
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,132
Our next mother
is liane cartman.

456
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,567
Her son claims to be the most
out-Of-Control kid in the world

457
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:37,200
And says there's nothing his
stupid mom can do about it.

458
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,234
Why won't you
kids behave?

459
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,532
Shut up, skank!

460
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,833
He's not
talking to you!

461
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,133
So, miss cartman, you can't
control your child?

462
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:46,998
Oh, my little
poopsy-Kins

463
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,732
Gets into no-No's
once in a while,

464
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,901
But he's still my perfect
little sumpsy-Kittles.

465
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,968
Well, your son made
a video backstage.

466
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:55,332
Let's take a look.

467
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,499
Maury, i am
out of control.

468
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,634
Yeah, i use drugs,
i can do what i want, bitch.

469
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,734
Yeah, i have sex and
i don't use protection.

470
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,785
It's my hot body,
i'll do what i want.

471
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,801
I don't go to school
and i kill people.

472
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:08,934
Whatever!
I'll do what i want.

473
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,466
Boo!Boo!

474
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,998
Oh, he's such a cutie.

475
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,868
Well, let's bring him out.
Here's eric cartman!

476
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,499
Whatever, whatever!

477
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,167
Maury, my mom
can't control me.

478
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,399
Ax her!
Go on, ax her!

479
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,400
Miss cartman, what does
your son to like to do?

480
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:25,732
Ooh, he loves
playing with

481
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,400
His "clyde frog"
and "wellington bear".

482
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,167
Mom, we're pretending,
remember?

483
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,365
Sex and drugs.

484
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,467
Oh, i mean
sex and drugs.

485
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:33,299
Ohh!

486
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,917
Whatever,
whatever!

487
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,466
I'll do what i want!

488
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,367
Oh, whatever,
you ain't tough, ho.

489
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:40,599
I roam with gangs.

490
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,417
Oh yeah?
I roam with 12 gangs.

491
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,292
And we only commit
hate crimes.

492
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:46,133
Whatever!
I'll do what i want!

493
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,299
Whatever!

494
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,699
You ain't bad.
You ain't nothing.

495
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,300
I ditch class and go shoot
heroin in the school bathroom.

496
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:54,701
Whatever! I ran for
congress and won.

497
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,185
Then i had sex
with an intern,

498
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,160
Killed her
and hid her body.

499
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,100
Whatever!
I'll do what i want!

500
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:01,151
What do we want?

501
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,132
Better prizes!

502
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,267
When do we
want them?

503
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,365
Now!

504
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,383
What do we want?

505
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:06,332
Better prizes.

506
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:07,400
When do we
want them?

507
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,599
Now then.

508
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,699
Sir, i really
gotta go home,

509
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:10,965
My parents are gonna
be sore at me.

510
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,965
Napoleon, you need to
understand something.

511
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,300
For you a union to work
all members must be prepared

512
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,618
To make sacrifices
and stick together.

513
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,643
But i gotta get back
to my family.

514
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,634
We're your family,
too, napoleon.

515
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:21,833
We're like you.

516
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:22,801
When we look at you
we don't even see

517
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,532
The testicles
on your chin.

518
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,117
We see the testicles
in your heart.

519
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:27,976
What do we want?
Better prizes!

520
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,766
When do we want them?
Now!

521
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,033
Oh, hamburgers, this just
keeps on getting worse.

522
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:35,499
Okay, folks, we're gonna
have to move along.

523
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:38,434
Why? We're a union and
we have a right to picket.

524
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,933
I'm sorry,
but the government

525
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,200
Does not recognize you
as a union.

526
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,267
You'll have to go.

527
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:43,265
What are you saying?

528
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,232
That because of
our appearance

529
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,233
Our organization
is less important?

530
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,200
Now now now,
i'm not telling you people

531
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,232
That your union
doesn't matter.

532
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,267
I'm just telling you that
you're not really people.

533
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,566
All right, that does it.

534
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,567
It's time to bring out
the big guns.

535
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:01,034
Prepare the video
sabotage.

536
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:03,467
Oh, no, not the
video sabotage.

537
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,234
Who is the most
out-Of-Control child?

538
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,098
We're back with maury.

539
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,432
We're here
talking with moms

540
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,868
Who think their children
are out of control.

541
00:18:12,903 --> 00:18:13,866
Whatever!

542
00:18:13,901 --> 00:18:16,501
I slaughtered five baby seals
with my bare hands.

543
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,567
Whatever!
I'll do what i want!

544
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,732
Now let's meet joline.

545
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,934
Joline says her daughter
is also out of control,

546
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,101
That she's flirting
with older men.

547
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,234
And, she's only
four months old.

548
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:27,699
Ohh!

549
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:29,365
Mm-Hmm, that's right.
Maury.

550
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,868
Let's bring her out,
here's chantal!

551
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,334
So, joline, exactly how is your
daughter out of control?

552
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,400
You say she flirts
with older men?

553
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:44,666
Maury, it's like this.

554
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,484
Whenever i have friends
over to the house

555
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,267
Chantal will come waltzing
in the living room

556
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,065
Completely naked!

557
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,500
Whatever. I helped in
a drive-By shooting.

558
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:56,118
Whatever! I digitally put
"jabba the hut"

559
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:58,701
Back into the original
"star wars" movie.

560
00:18:58,736 --> 00:18:59,532
I'll do what i want!

561
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:02,000
Wow, that is
out of control.

562
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:02,965
Why, just last night

563
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,167
I had three gentlemen callers
over to my house

564
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,535
And chantal
took her clothes off

565
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,868
Right in front
of everybody!

566
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,965
Boo!Boo!

567
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,534
You see? There she goes,
there she goes.

568
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:18,232
You god damn whore!

569
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,084
Attention, maury viewers.

570
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,866
What the hell is this?

571
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,234
A lot of decent hard-Working
freaks in america

572
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,818
Are losing their
talk show jobs

573
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,332
To freaks of
a different nature.

574
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,667
Sure, everyone in this great
country of ours is a freak.

575
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,518
But true, physically-Deformed
freaks must be recognized.

576
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,334
For it is these real freaks
that make you all feel better

577
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,168
About yourselves
for not being one.

578
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:39,285
So next time you're
watching television

579
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,110
Make sure it's a show
with freak-Freaks,

580
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,866
And not just with people
that are freaks

581
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,466
Because they're stupid trailer
trash from the south.

582
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:48,601
That's what we mean when we say
look for the true freak label.

583
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:53,032
* look for the
true freak label *

584
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,450
* when you are watching
a tv talk show *

585
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:01,693
* remember somewhere
a union's growing *

586
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:05,231
* our wages going
to feed the kids *

587
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:08,734
* and rob the house
we work for *

588
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,899
* but who's complaining?

589
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:14,599
* we're t.F.U.
We're making our way *

590
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:19,065
* so always look for
the true freak label *

591
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,634
* because you need us
right here in the u.S.A. *

592
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:27,234
Ah, sorry, america,
little glitch there.

593
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,399
Anyway-

594
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:29,499
They're right.

595
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,267
We should've never
crossed that picket line.

596
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:33,232
Come on, honey.

597
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,732
Wait, wait, come back.

598
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,267
Maybe we could make the other
out-Of-Control kids

599
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,866
Take their clothes off, too.

600
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:40,032
Whatever!
I'll crap in maury's pants.

601
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:44,234
Sir, the ratings have just
started to plummet.

602
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,601
Those damn freaks!

603
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,333
I gave you shoes!
And groceries!

604
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,851
And this is how
you repay me?

605
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,334
Very well,
come upstairs and...

606
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:01,501
We'll negotiate.

607
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,299
We did it,
the strike worked.

608
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:08,334
Now we can go on
with our careers.

609
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,968
Thank god that's over.

610
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,532
Now i can
get back home.

611
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,200
Butters, you have
screwed me out of a prize

612
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,634
For the last time!

613
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,232
Oh, double hamburgers.

614
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:21,183
Jesus christ!
That out-Of-Control kid

615
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:24,100
Ripped poor napoleon's balls
right off!

616
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,584
Get him!

617
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,998
Ahh!

618
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:32,200
Hey, things actually turned out
okay for me this time.

619
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:33,584
Butters!

620
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:34,934
Oh, i know.
