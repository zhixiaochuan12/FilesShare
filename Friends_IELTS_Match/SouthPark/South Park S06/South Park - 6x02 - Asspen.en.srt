1
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:11,300
Thanks for having us all over
for dinner, chris and linda.

2
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:12,466
Yes, it was fabulous.

3
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,165
Oh, we're just really
happy that your boys

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,199
Have become such good friends
with our little butters.

5
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,267
Yeah, we figured that if our
boys are gonna be great friends

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:21,100
We should all get to
be friends too.

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:22,267
Friends by default.

8
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:25,133
Well, our boys do seem
to be spending

9
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,065
A lot of time
together lately.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,499
I think ever since
their friend kenny died

11
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:30,400
They've been looking for
someone to fill the void.

12
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:32,367
Well, our son is
a perfect void-Filler.

13
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:34,300
It's nice that he
finally has your sons

14
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,133
To be his best buddies.

15
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,100
Look, you guys,
butters is asleep.

16
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:39,933
He's such a douche bag.

17
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:41,399
Hey, you guys
ever seen this trick?

18
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,601
When someone's sleeping you can
take a glass of warm water.

19
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,067
And you put
their hand in it.

20
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,466
Yeah, and then what?

21
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,467
And then you
pee on 'em.

22
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,965
Heh-Heh, heh-Heh.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,334
No, dude, you're supposed to
put their hand in warm water

24
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:55,868
<i>And it makes them pee.</i>

25
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:56,702
Oh, really?

26
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:57,466
Oh, well.

27
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,965
And we were thinking

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,117
Since they've all become
such close friends

29
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:03,234
How great it would be for us
to all go together

30
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,933
To aspen for a ski weekend.

31
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:07,000
Aspen? We can't
really afford that.

32
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,998
No, you see, linda
and i found this ad

33
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:12,033
Where you can get two nights
free in a condo in aspen

34
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,634
If you attend a
time-Share presentation.

35
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,068
They let you
stay for free?

36
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,302
Yes, and all
we have to do

37
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,466
Is attend a
30-Minute meeting.

38
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,267
Sounds good to me,
let's go this weekend.

39
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:26,033
Oh boy, skiing in aspen,
i can't wait.

40
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,167
Hey, boys, we're all going
to aspen for the weekend.

41
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,566
All right!
All right!

42
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,300
Wow, a ski trip with
my new best buddies!

43
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:36,601
Oh, i'm all sticky.

44
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,267
Here we are everyone.

45
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,067
Oh, this is gonna
be so much fun.

46
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,601
I haven't skied
in years.

47
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,100
Where are
butters and eric?

48
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,132
They're still asleep.

49
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,501
Butters, eric, come on,
we gotta get to the powder.

50
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,067
Hello, folks, i'm phil
and this is josh.

51
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,300
We're with the aspen
time-Share company.

52
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,466
Hello.
Hello.

53
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:29,033
You folks
enjoying the condo?

54
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:30,334
It's lovely,
thank you.

55
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,532
You guys, you guys.

56
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,167
You're not gonna believe this,
this is so funny.

57
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:34,899
What?

58
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,200
So last night while
butters was asleep

59
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,501
I gave him a "hitler".

60
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,499
What's a hitler?

61
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,650
You know, when
somebody's sleeping

62
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,992
You put your finger
up your butt

63
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:43,163
And then wipe it on
their upper lip

64
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:44,300
To give them a little
hitler mustache.

65
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,567
You've never
hitler'd anyone?

66
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:48,032
No, i never have.

67
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,117
Shh shh,
here he comes.

68
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,226
Good morning,
fellas!

69
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:51,300
All set to go skiing?

70
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,132
What's so funny?

71
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,067
Nothing, butters.
Right, guys?

72
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,933
Well, we can't
wait to show you

73
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,300
What aspen time-Share
is offering investors.

74
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,717
Shall we do our
30-Minute meeting?

75
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,065
Oh, do we have to
do it right now?

76
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,400
Well, best to do it and
get it out of the way.

77
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,499
Okay.

78
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:08,899
Boys, we have to
go to this

79
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,232
Time-Share presentation
real quick,

80
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,934
But you go meet your ski
instructor on the bunny hill.

81
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:13,666
Okay.
Okay.

82
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,234
We'll meet you boys
on the slopes.

83
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,901
Hey, do you guys
smell that?

84
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:18,799
Smell what?

85
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,601
It kind of smells
stinky in this condo.

86
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,267
I don't smell anything,
do you, guys?

87
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:35,666
You guys smell that?

88
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,199
It smells bad
out here too.

89
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,634
I'm starting to think this whole
town smells like doo-Doo.

90
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,234
Yeah, well, you see, that's
why they call it ass-Pen.

91
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:45,367
All right,little dudes,
great to see you out here.

92
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,432
My name is thumper,

93
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,234
And i'm gonna be your
cool ski instructor.

94
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,332
His name is
thumper?

95
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,517
We're gonna take it slow,
take it easy,

96
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:53,667
Make sure everybody
has a good time.

97
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,434
'Cause what is
skiing about?

98
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,601
Having a good...?

99
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,799
Time, that's right.

100
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,584
Now just a few safety things
to keep in mind.

101
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,334
First of all, look straight
ahead when you ski.

102
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,901
If you look down
you're gonna fall.

103
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:07,399
You're gonna have
a bad time.

104
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:08,833
Also, be aware of
skiers around you.

105
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:11,267
If you run into another skier
your skis are gonna cross-

106
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:12,899
Gonna have a bad time.

107
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,033
So where's the part where
we have a good time?

108
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,133
Hey, little dude, you got
some crap right here.

109
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,432
That's my face, sir.

110
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,900
Okay, we're gonna do this
without any poles

111
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:23,334
Until we know our two
primary feet positions.

112
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:26,601
To go slow, we wedge
our skis together

113
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,599
In the shape of
a slice of pizza.

114
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,400
Then to go faster,
we put them parallel like...

115
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,667
French fries.
You see that?

116
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:36,434
Pizza, french fries...

117
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,132
Pizza,
french fries...

118
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,634
<i>Hey, this is gonna be
just like eating at shakey's,</i>

119
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:43,098
Huh, fellas?

120
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,234
Okay, let's have the little
dude at the end try it first.

121
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,267
What's your name?

122
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,532
Iiiike!

123
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,767
Okay, mike,
ski down to me.

124
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:52,432
Go on, ike.

125
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:55,299
Pizza, french fries...

126
00:04:55,334 --> 00:05:00,567
Pizza, french fries,
french fries!

127
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:03,767
Pizza!

128
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,699
Okay, you see
what he did?

129
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,399
He french fried
when he should've pizza'd.

130
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,667
You french fry when you pizza,
you're gonna have a bad time.

131
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:15,501
And so we think
we can convince you

132
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:16,866
To buy one of our condos

133
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,098
That's opening right here
in phase four.

134
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:21,634
That sounds like a great
investment opportunity.

135
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,367
I'm sorry, but none of us
can really afford

136
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:24,300
To own our own
vacation condo.

137
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,332
Yeah, to be honest,

138
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,466
We're just doing
this meeting

139
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,101
Because of the
two nights free deal.

140
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:30,701
Oh, i know, that's what
everybody says.

141
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:31,998
"Not me,
i can't afford it."

142
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,334
But what if i told you could
own one of our properties

143
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,400
For only $8,000.

144
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,365
Wow!

145
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,065
For $8,000 we can
buy a condo here?

146
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,634
Well, you see, time-Share
means you buy the condo

147
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,834
With about 20 other
people like yourselves.

148
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:46,000
You share the condo
with other investors

149
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:48,334
And pick the time
you want to stay.

150
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,651
Share, time...
time-Share!

151
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,899
So then it's
not really ours.

152
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:55,150
Sure it is, 1/24th-
And-A-Half yours.

153
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:56,876
You see, time-Share
has made it possible

154
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,532
For even working-Class
people like you

155
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,934
To say, "i've got
a little place in aspen."

156
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,532
Try, try saying it.

157
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,550
"I've got a little
place in aspen."

158
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:07,499
I've got a little place
in aspen.

159
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,199
Rolls off the tongue
nicely, doesn't it?

160
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,901
Say, guys, how you'd like to
tell that hot secretary,

161
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,334
"I've got a nice little
place in aspen."?

162
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,184
Ha ha ha!
Just kidding, wives.

163
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:17,259
Listen, ah,
it's been 30 minutes.

164
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,265
We'd like to go
hit the slopes now.

165
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,701
Well, you still gotta come
to the time-Share luncheon.

166
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,332
We did give you a free
condo for the weekend.

167
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:26,000
Your ad said we only had to
attend a 30-Minute meeting.

168
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,267
Right, but this
isn't that meeting.

169
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,098
The luncheon is
that meeting.

170
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,067
Don't worry, you're gonna
have a great free meal

171
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:32,267
At the luncheon.

172
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,167
French fries,
pizza.

173
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:38,466
French fries.

174
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,801
Come on, cartman!

175
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:40,567
Ah, no more.

176
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,067
Looks like you think you're a
pretty good skier, huh, kid?

177
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,868
Well, i'm catching on
pretty fast i guess.

178
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:48,367
I've been skiing
for 22 years.

179
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>Think you can beat me?</i>

180
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,532
Ah, no.

181
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,367
What's your name,
hotshot?

182
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,432
Stan, marsh.

183
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:58,200
<i>Stan darsh
is more like it.</i>

184
00:06:58,235 --> 00:06:59,332
Ha, darsh.

185
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,801
All right,
how about a race then,

186
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:03,065
You and me?

187
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
Dude, i'm just
learning.

188
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,100
Ooh.

189
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:11,534
Looks to me like you're not
such a hotshot after all.

190
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,133
I never said i was.

191
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,065
Ooh!

192
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,232
Ooh.
Ooh.

193
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,766
You may think you got
what it takes

194
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,200
But as long as i'm around
you'll always be #2.

195
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:22,267
See you later, darsh.

196
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:32,334
And that is why owning
a piece of an aspen condo

197
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,318
Is not only possible...

198
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,267
It's downright smart.

199
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:35,332
Uh-Huh.

200
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,667
Oh, here it is,
as promised,

201
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,365
A fabulous free lunch.

202
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,801
Wow, filet mignon
and lobster.

203
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,866
Not bad.

204
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,567
It's nice to feel
rich, isn't it?

205
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:46,234
Oh, y'know, this
is really great.

206
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:49,567
It sure is.

207
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,165
What?

208
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,133
You see, that's the great
thing about time-Share.

209
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,267
You get a little taste of
luxuries you can't afford.

210
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,401
And then share it with the
people that come tomorrow.

211
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,501
All right, look, we've been
here for over three hours.

212
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:04,566
Yeah, could we
go now, please?

213
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,467
Of course you can,
go hit those slopes.

214
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:08,334
If you could just please
show me the backs

215
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,051
Of your table
place cards real quick.

216
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:13,734
Oh my god,
you got the red sticker!

217
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,001
They got the
red sticker?

218
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,468
They got the
red sticker!

219
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:17,866
What's the
red sticker?

220
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,834
Well, that means if you come
up to the condo sales office

221
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,000
You'll receive one of
three great prizes.

222
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:22,799
No, no, no-

223
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,434
We did your meeting,
we did your lunch.

224
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:25,666
We're finished, okay?

225
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:27,065
Okay, okay,
fine, i mean.

226
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,934
It would only take a second,
but i mean, y'know,

227
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:30,833
What did we do for you

228
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,334
Except give you a free condo
for the weekend?

229
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,301
Seems like you could
just at least

230
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,234
Come up and see
what prize you got.

231
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,734
Oh, all right!

232
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,150
Pizza...
french fries...

233
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,667
French fries...
pizza...

234
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:52,267
Pizza, french fries.

235
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,165
I wonder where
our parents are.

236
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,150
Who cares? I'm having
more fun on my own.

237
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:03,100
Well, well, well,
if it isn't stan darsh.

238
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,132
Oh, no.

239
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,200
Say, darsh, you don't mind
if i take heather out

240
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,000
For some fondue
tonight, do you?

241
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,098
Heather?

242
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,200
Sorry, stan, it's just that
when it comes to skiing

243
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,666
Tad has all
the right moves.

244
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,968
I just might show her
my moves tonight,

245
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:16,933
If you know what i mean.

246
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,632
You aren't mad,
are you, stan?

247
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,067
I mean, a girl's gotta look out
for her best interests.

248
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,532
Who are you people?

249
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,632
Still don't want
to race me?

250
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,534
I told you he was
chicken, heather.

251
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,098
Stan marsh the darsh.

252
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,567
All right, dude, if i race you
will you leave me alone?

253
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,332
Ooh!
Ooh!

254
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,732
All right, fine.

255
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,400
You and me
at the summit, now.

256
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:40,699
Okay.

257
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,634
Race, race!
Race, race!

258
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,699
Ladies and gentlemen,

259
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:48,434
Aspen now presents another
extreme racing showdown.

260
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,367
Seven-Time world aspen champion
tad mccowski

261
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,168
Versus eight-Year-Old
stan marsh.

262
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:57,934
Ha! You're going down,
little boy.

263
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:59,766
Yeah, probably.

264
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:01,934
Do you think
stan has a chance?

265
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,467
Go, stan!

266
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,132
Fries... fries.

267
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,834
He's got him,
tad's gonna win it!

268
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:29,467
Yeah! Yeah!

269
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:31,265
Yeah!

270
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,100
You lose, darsh.

271
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,866
Yeah!

272
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,567
Uh, stan, you gave it
your best shot.

273
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:44,199
And that's all
jesus asks of you.

274
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:47,200
Dude, i'm just happy this
whole stupid thing is over with.

275
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:50,234
No hard feelings,
right, darsh?

276
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:53,968
Yeah!

277
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,834
Stan, for whatever
it's worth,

278
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,734
I think you were
really brave.

279
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:00,766
Thanks, who are you?

280
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:02,367
Hey, all the cool teens
are gonna be

281
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,468
At the youth center
tonight for a dance.

282
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,485
I hope you'll come
because you're just so...

283
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,467
Well, you're just so-
Well, that's all.

284
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,732
Finally, we get
to go skiing.

285
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,065
Oh my god, look how long
the lift lines are.

286
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,167
Yeah, i guess these passes
the time-Share salesmen gave us

287
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,368
Will come in handy.

288
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,499
Can i help you?

289
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:22,799
Yes, we have
the special passes

290
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:25,868
To use the exclusive lift
from the time-Share company.

291
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,167
Oh, go right on
ahead, folks.

292
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:29,467
Thank you.

293
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,933
Well, this
certainly is nice.

294
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,632
Yeah, we may not have
gotten to ski earlier,

295
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,868
But with this lift we'll get
more runs in than anybody.

296
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:39,234
Have fun waiting
in line, suckers!

297
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,265
Oh, chris.

298
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,632
Heh-Heh,
heh, heh...

299
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,200
Hey look, this chairlift
goes right into a building.

300
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,666
Welcome back, folks.

301
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,300
We've got a special new offer
we can't wait to tell you about.

302
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,833
Oh, god damn it!

303
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:55,799
Dude, it's been 12 hours.

304
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,467
Where the hell
are our parents?

305
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,499
I'm glad you guys came.

306
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,234
Do you like our
youth center?

307
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,399
Seems fine.

308
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,899
Yeah, too bad we're
getting shut down.

309
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,501
That hotshot skier tad's father
is gonna bulldoze the building.

310
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:13,100
Where are all us kids
supposed to go?

311
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:13,467
Don't care.

312
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,801
What do you
wanna do now?

313
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,201
I don't know.

314
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:20,567
Let's dance.

315
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,817
Butters, i hate you with
every inch of my body.

316
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,059
All right, aspen,
as a special treat tonight

317
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,267
We're proud to have
the winner of today's race,

318
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:34,367
Tad mccowski!

319
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:36,700
Yeah!

320
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,899
Oh god.

321
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:38,833
Hey, everyone.

322
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,067
I'd like to sing
a little song if i may.

323
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,165
Ooh.
Ooh.

324
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,632
Oh god,
let's go, you guys.

325
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:48,234
This is a song i wrote
about... stan marsh.

326
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,299
* staaan darsh *

327
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:54,234
* stan darsh
darshy darsh *

328
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:57,666
* stan darsh

329
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,534
* stan darsh

330
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,067
* stan darsh, darsh

331
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:05,699
* stan darsh *

332
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,434
Dude, what the hell
is your problem?

333
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,299
Ooh!
Ooh!

334
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,300
I raced you, you won.

335
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,833
A rematch?

336
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:16,300
Oh, darsh, you're even
dumber than i thought.

337
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:18,334
He'll ski you
anytime, anywhere.

338
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,232
Yeah!
Yeah!

339
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,532
But this time
if he wins

340
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,934
You get your dad to not
close our youth center.

341
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,866
What?

342
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:26,868
All right then,
let's make it interesting.

343
00:13:26,903 --> 00:13:31,033
Tomorrow afternoon,
on the k-13.

344
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,666
The k-13?

345
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:37,267
But that's the most dangerous
run in all of america.

346
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:40,968
Well, i'm not chicken.

347
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:43,100
Are you, darsh?

348
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,567
I'll be there,
you queen.

349
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:46,484
Oh yeah?

350
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,332
Yeah!

351
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:51,968
Oh, darsh, you're even dumber
than i thought, again.

352
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,534
See ya tomorrow.

353
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,167
You're not really
gonna go down that

354
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,601
K-13 run,
are you, stan?

355
00:13:58,636 --> 00:13:59,666
Dude, i have to.

356
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:01,968
Stan, you can't let that
tad guy get to you.

357
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:03,032
Screw him, dude.

358
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:03,766
Dude,
he's got heather!

359
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,167
You don't even
know heather!

360
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:07,566
I know, i know, it's-

361
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,199
Look, i can't explain it
but i have to do this.

362
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,834
I'm not gonna die, i mean,
how bad can the k-13 be?

363
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:14,801
The k-13? You don't
wanna go down that run.

364
00:14:14,836 --> 00:14:16,199
That run's got a history.

365
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,599
35 people have died
going down it,

366
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,167
And some say you can still
see their ghosts up there.

367
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:22,165
It was on that
very ski run

368
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,467
That a group of students were
killed by a wolf boy

369
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:25,432
Who escaped from
the mental institution.

370
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,801
You see, that ski run
was once a burial ground

371
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,499
To a tribe of
vampire wichika indians

372
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:31,267
Who ate the flesh of
children with no eyes.

373
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:34,501
Yup, a lot of history
on that ski run.

374
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:36,701
Thank you.

375
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,799
Yeah.

376
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:39,866
Look, stan,
when kenny died

377
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,317
I learned how important
friends are.

378
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,734
I'm not gonna
lose another friend.

379
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:43,699
This isn't about you, kyle,

380
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,033
I have to do this, okay,
i have to!

381
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,634
And so you see, it's the
investment opportunity

382
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,799
That keeps on giving.

383
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,134
How many times do we
have to tell you this?

384
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,399
We don't want to buy
shares in a condo.

385
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,517
And we certainly don't
want to pressure you.

386
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,292
Pressure us? You kept us
all day yesterday

387
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,847
And then had a chairlift
bring us back.

388
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,574
Hey, you can leave
any time you want.

389
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,232
Of course, that is if
you don't want the

390
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,699
Super-Secret fun prize for
attending the slide show.

391
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,300
No, we don't want the super-
Secret fun prize, all right?

392
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,801
We just want to ski!

393
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,232
Come on, everybody.

394
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,267
I know, have you ever considered
going in on a time-Share?

395
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,567
That's only a couple
thousand each, josh.

396
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,801
Don't listen to him,
let's just go.

397
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:23,818
My god, can you believe
those people?

398
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,766
I hope you don't
blame me for all that.

399
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,501
I mean, the ad did just say
a 30-Minute presentation.

400
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,501
Let's just
get out of here.

401
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,383
Folks, i'm glad
you're back

402
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,532
Because we forgot
to mention

403
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,300
Time-Share condos are
still deeded properties.

404
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,234
Ahh!
Ahh!

405
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,200
Ooh, you folks really
lucked out this time.

406
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,899
You're visitors #1,000.

407
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:47,200
That means you can listen
to our special offer

408
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,699
For privileged members only.

409
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:51,868
That does it,
i'm calling the police.

410
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,667
Mr. Ski instructor,
i need a lot of training fast.

411
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,799
I'm gonna race down the k-13.

412
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,998
The k-13, but you're
just a beginner.

413
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:04,367
If you ski out of your league,
you're gonna have a bad time.

414
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:05,734
I have to do this, okay,
i have to.

415
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,032
All right, well,
if you gotta get good

416
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,067
At something really fast,
there's only one way to do it.

417
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:11,234
Come on!

418
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,567
* the day is
approaching *

419
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:21,933
* so give it your best

420
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,098
* and you've got to
reach your prime *

421
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,033
* that's when you need to put
yourself to the test *

422
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:30,884
* and show us
a passage of time *

423
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,410
* we're gonna need
a montage *

424
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,866
* a sports-Training montage

425
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:40,450
* show a lot of things
happening at once *

426
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:42,965
* remind everyone
of what's going on *

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,100
* and with every shot
show a little improvement *

428
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,801
* to show it all
would take too long *

429
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:53,232
* that's called a montage

430
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,484
* even "rocky"
had a montage *

431
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,643
* in any sport
if you want to go *

432
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,767
* from just a beginner
to a pro *

433
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,632
* you need a montage

434
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09,732
* a simple
little montage *

435
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:15,199
* always fade out
in a montage *

436
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,267
* if you fade out it seems
like more time has passed *

437
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,635
* in a montage

438
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,968
* montage... *

439
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:29,599
All the ad said

440
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,300
Was that we had to attend
a 30-Minute, right?

441
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,401
And it's been
a day-And-A-Half.

442
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:33,467
These guys
won't let us leave.

443
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,766
That's not true, officers,

444
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:36,933
We said they could
leave at any time.

445
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,601
All right, let me see if
i got this straight.

446
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,799
You two gentlemen
are offering part-Time

447
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,968
Limited liability ownership
in one of your fabulous condos

448
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,200
For the one-Time price
of $8,000?!

449
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,632
That's right!

450
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,199
Sounds to me like if anybody
should be arrested,

451
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,300
It should be you people for
passing up such a great deal.

452
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:54,599
That's right,

453
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,334
You're practically stealing
condos at that price.

454
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,234
Book 'em, danno.

455
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:00,050
Oh, jesus.

456
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,265
No, no!

457
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,632
The police work for
time-Share too?

458
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:08,701
The police, the mayor, the
president of the united states.

459
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:12,200
Perhaps now you see the
severity of your situation.

460
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:14,651
I think we shall all sit down

461
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:17,067
And listen to
the presentation.

462
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:18,200
Sit!

463
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,998
Now, you're probably
asking yourselves,

464
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:27,265
Can my time-Share condo
turn into a profit?

465
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,501
What kind of cash flow can i
realize from my investment?

466
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:30,866
The answer might
astonish you.

467
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,634
For over 10 years,
investors have seen their-

468
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,267
The powder is fresh
and the stage is set

469
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:40,133
For tad versus stan
on the k-13.

470
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,634
This time you're not
just gonna lose,

471
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:44,332
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

472
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,667
I can't lose
another friend.

473
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:46,933
First kenny
and now stan.

474
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:48,934
All i'm gonna have left
are you two douches.

475
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,234
Ready, set, go!

476
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,283
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

477
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:57,509
Tad's got the lead.

478
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:59,701
Come on, stan!

479
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,265
Ha ha!

480
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,067
This should slow down
darsh a bit.

481
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:14,300
And it looks like tad
is way out in front.

482
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:17,267
Now i'll win for sure.

483
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:20,200
Oh dude,
i can't look.

484
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's see what some sand
does to your speed, darsh.

485
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:35,000
He doesn't
stand a chance now.

486
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,132
I'm gonna beat him!

487
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:42,167
The race is half over and
tad is still out in the lead.

488
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,634
Ha, when darsh skis by here
i'll let all these hamsters go.

489
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:49,501
That should distract him
just long enough

490
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:52,734
For me to win
the race!

491
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:53,599
Oh, tad.

492
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,267
What are you
doing up here?

493
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:57,599
Oh, nothing.

494
00:19:57,634 --> 00:20:01,667
<i>I just thought maybe i could
distract you with these.</i>

495
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,100
Whuu... uhh,
whoa...

496
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,367
Good job, dude!

497
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,167
Thanks.

498
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,534
You did it, stan.

499
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,833
Thanks a lot, stan.

500
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:27,167
Now we're gonna be able
to keep the youth center.

501
00:20:27,202 --> 00:20:29,998
Well, that does it.

502
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,634
Looks like the spirits
of the wakichaw indians

503
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,901
Can finally
rest in peace.

504
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:39,032
Thank you... stan.

505
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,984
Stan, i was
wrong about you.

506
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,866
Would you like to
go out again?

507
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:45,434
Go ahead, stan, she's
everything you ever wanted.

508
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:47,200
There you are,
boys.

509
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,766
Mom, dad.

510
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:50,065
Where the hell
have you guys been?

511
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,583
We got a little held up at the
time-Share sales office.

512
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,067
Yeah, but the good news is we
finally came to our senses

513
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:57,732
And brought some shares
in a condo.

514
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,200
So we all get to come to aspen
for two weeks every year.

515
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,165
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

516
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,501
What's the matter,
didn't you boys like skiing?

517
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:06,033
No, we can't keep track
of when you pizza

518
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,399
And when you french fries.

519
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,534
And when the hotshot asshole
skier takes your girl,

520
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,899
If you're supposed to
race him the first time,

521
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,600
Or train first to beat him on
