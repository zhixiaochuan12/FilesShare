Okay, now put on
the nose, tweek.

15
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:39,951
I can't!
You do it!

16
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:41,666
Just stick it on!

17
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,234
But what if i put it
in the wrong place?

18
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,799
Just put it
between its eyes!

19
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,684
Agh! But what if while
i'm putting on the nose,

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,534
The snow man comes to life
and tries to kill me?

21
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:49,434
Tweek, when has
that ever happened

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,400
Except for
that one time?

23
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:51,965
Yeah!

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,965
Hey fellas!

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,032
Oh, hey butters.

26
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,300
How are things going
with your new best friend?

27
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:57,265
Well, tweek's okay,

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,133
But he's certainly
no kenny!

29
00:00:58,168 --> 00:00:59,065
Agh!

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,534
Yeah, but he's still
better than you, butters.

31
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:01,566
Well, that's good.

32
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,434
Good luck being their
new friend, tweek.

33
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,934
Hopefully you'll do
better than me.

34
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,532
See ya, fellas.

35
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,267
Oh man, that is
way too much pressure!

36
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,165
You guys!
You guys!

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,133
You're not gonna
believe it!

38
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,466
Uh, oh.

39
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,167
Everything's gonna
be okay, you guys!

40
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:15,901
Life isn't so crappy
after all!

41
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:16,666
It's not?

42
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,365
No, i was looking
in this magazine,

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,716
And i found an ad for
little ocean creatures

44
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,033
That you can buy
and raise in your room!

45
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:23,767
No way.

46
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:24,432
Look!

47
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,666
Sea people.

48
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,998
You keep them in
a big tank of water,

49
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,467
And they build castles
and play basketball and stuff.

50
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:31,401
Nuh-Uh.

51
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,265
Yeah!

52
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,283
And they ride around
on turtles

53
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,267
And they play
games with fish!

54
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,799
No way.

55
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,933
Okay, kyle, you're being a
negative nancy, stop it.

56
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:41,534
Unless you want everyone to call
you negative nancy from now on.

57
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,667
Now, what we need is
to all chip in $4.00

58
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,501
And we can
have them here tomorrow.

59
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,699
Only $16.00?

60
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:50,067
They can't be cool
if they're only $16.00.

61
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,517
If nancy doesn't
want to chip in,

62
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,334
Then it will be
$5.35 per person.

63
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,334
Alright,
i'll chip in.

64
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,718
Agh, me too!

65
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,067
Oh, alright.

66
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:04,200
Butters, don't forget
dinner is in two hours!

67
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:05,432
Okay, mom.

68
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:08,234
I'm just gonna be
up here doin' my homework.

69
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:12,733
Yes, by day he's mild-Mannered,
sweet and innocent butters!

70
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:16,133
But nobody knows that he is
actually his dark underside!

71
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,232
Professor chaos!

72
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:23,033
Ha-Ha, time to wreak havoc
on the world that shunned me!

73
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,300
Ha ha... ha ha...

74
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,998
Professor chaos!

75
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,501
Ah, my faithful companion
in world destruction,

76
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,532
General disarray!

77
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,766
I have done
as you asked

78
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,400
And brought the
first load of scrap wood!

79
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,833
Excellent,
general disarray!

80
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,801
Now we can begin my most
horrible, evil plan yet

81
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,399
To wreak havoc
on humanity!

82
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:43,334
What dastardly deed
are we doing now?

83
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:45,466
Simple, my dear general...

84
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,968
We are going to
block out the sun!

85
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:49,666
Whoa!

86
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,899
I have
plotted for weeks

87
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,667
And figured that if we
build a huge wooden shade

88
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:55,701
80 feet high
and 50 feet wide

89
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:56,933
Precisely on this hill,

90
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,934
South park will forever be
cast in a great shadow!

91
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:00,899
Oh, awesome!

92
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,800
Soon all people will
have to live like moles!

93
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:04,667
They will live only
to remember with sorrow

94
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,534
How great the sun
used to be!

95
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:08,265
Ha ha ahaaaaa!

96
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,133
Cool, it'll be just like
on 'the simpsons'!

97
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:13,265
Huh?

98
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,432
They did that
on 'the simpsons'.

99
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,100
I think it was the
mr. Burns character,

100
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,734
He tried to block
springfield from the sun.

101
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:18,632
He did?

102
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,400
Aw heck, i thought
i was being original.

103
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,365
So how do
we build it?

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
Aw, i don't
wanna do it now.

105
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:25,701
Not if they already
did it on 'the simpsons'.

106
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:27,065
Now i gotta think
of something else...

107
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,467
Goddammit, how come every time
i think of something clever

108
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:31,133
'The simpsons'
already did it?

109
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,532
Sea people...

110
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,868
Coming in the mail
tomorrow...

111
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:41,501
Yes... yes...

112
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,432
* look at me,
i'm living free *

113
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:52,050
* free and clean
amongst the sea people *

114
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,209
* we look for pirates,
and search for gold *

115
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,334
* life is an adventure
with the sea people *

116
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,135
* they don't ever complain

117
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,866
* they don't
call me fat *

118
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,100
* they don't make me
do homework *

119
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:02,699
* or nothing like that

120
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:04,234
* this is the way
life was meant to be *

121
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,968
* laughing and singing

122
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,752
* the sea people
and me *

123
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,501
* sea people
and meeeeee *

124
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:19,265
Wow, only 3 more hours,
sea people-

125
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,666
Only 3 more hours
and you can take me away

126
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,734
From this crappy goddamn planet
full of hippies.

127
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,534
Okay, i've added the water
purifier tablet

128
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,334
To the "sea people
kingdom tank".

129
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,933
Now, it says "step 2...

130
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,918
"Add the sea people eggs
to the water

131
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:38,833
You will see sea life
spring instantly."

132
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:41,033
Okay, let's just run through
this one more time.

133
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,165
When the sea people arrive,

134
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,367
I will welcome them south park
as ambassador of earth.

135
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:45,699
Tweek, you give them
the key to the city,

136
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,866
And we'll all engage them
in simple, conversation.

137
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,300
We've got to make the sea people
feel comfortable, ready?

138
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,051
Ready,
let's see 'em.

139
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,767
Hold the sign up, kyle!

140
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,234
Higher, kyle!

141
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,933
Okay...

142
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,200
Here we go...

143
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,834
Are they playing
basketball?

144
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,766
What the
f- Is this?

145
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,151
Hey, these are
brine shrimp.

146
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:32,501
I used to feed them
to my fish.

147
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:33,418
I got ripped off!

148
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,793
I told you, cartman-

149
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,098
Oh shut up, kyle!

150
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,532
Shut your
goddamn jew mouth!

151
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,466
You people are why there's
war in the middle east!

152
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:41,033
And you, tweek, why don't you learn
to button your shirt right for once!

153
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,267
You're as bad as stan
with his stupid girlfriend

154
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,200
Always spending time
with her!

155
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,265
God, i hate you guys!

156
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,334
They were supposed to take me
away to their underwater kingdom!

157
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:51,100
They were supposed to take me
on adventures of the deep!

158
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,300
They package brine shrimp
and sell them to kids?

159
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:54,532
That's not right, man!

160
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,833
What are we gonna
do with them?

161
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,065
Who cares,
throw them away!

162
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,300
Let's pour them in the teacher's
coffee tomorrow morning!

163
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:00,968
Yeah, that'd be funny!

164
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,934
Huh-Huh, okay!

165
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:12,332
Alright,
listen to me.

166
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,501
We must take a strict
vow of silence.

167
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:16,651
Jesus christ,
we killed her!

168
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,767
Shhh, tweek
shut the hell up!

169
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,834
General disarray, are
your parents home? No.

170
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:25,466
I've done it,
general disarray!

171
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,167
I've completed my most
horrible deed to date!

172
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:28,032
What?

173
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,834
You know the big statue
in the town square

174
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,134
Of pioneer john
wesley powell?

175
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,400
I snuck over there
with a hacksaw

176
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,767
And i cut off his head!

177
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,065
Ha ha!
Oh... uh-

178
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,834
They're probably
just realizing it now!

179
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,566
Quick, we must
turn on the news!

180
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,167
...but hillary clinton's ass
just keeps getting bigger.

181
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,098
Also in the news tonight

182
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,799
A vandal has apparently
cut off and stolen

183
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:49,434
The head of the powell statue
in the south park town square!

184
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,532
Look!
Look!

185
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:51,650
I made the news!

186
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,699
I've wreaked havoc!

187
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,400
The head was taken
in the early morning hours,

188
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:56,151
And the police
have no leads!

189
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:58,293
I finally made
the world sorry!

190
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,365
I brought
sadness and chaos!

191
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,699
This act reminded
all of us of the time

192
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,801
That bart simpson took the head
of the springfield statue

193
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,402
In one of their
classic episodes.

194
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,069
Here's what some people
had to say.

195
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:09,666
Well, i think whoever
took the head

196
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,234
<i>Was really just doing
an homage to the simpsons</i>

197
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,365
And i think it's great!

198
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,267
Yes, it really made me reflect
on that episode and laugh!

199
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,566
The simpsons is
such a great show

200
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,534
And we need reminders like this
to keep us watching!

201
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,799
Aw... aw,
son-Of-A-Bitch.

202
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,734
The police say that instead of
looking for the missing head,

203
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:26,866
They'd rather
leave it off,

204
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:28,933
And be reminded of
the simpsons every day.

205
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:31,234
Why didn't you tell me the
simpsons already did that?

206
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,365
You seemed so proud

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,234
I didn't wanna
bum you out.

208
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,234
Stupid simpsons...

209
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,799
Hello there, phillip!

210
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,501
I brought
you something!

211
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:41,167
Ooh, what is it?

212
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,033
See? We're just watching
cartoons like always.

213
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,132
Nothing's changed.

214
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:45,634
Jesus christ,
she's dead!

215
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,666
Stop it, tweek!

216
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,651
We're pretending like
nothing happened.

217
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,601
Phillip, i think
i may have accidentally

218
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,866
Killed celine dion!

219
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,501
Killing is never
an accident you dickface!

220
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,566
Oh jesus,
change the channel!

221
00:07:57,601 --> 00:08:00,317
...and in other news
still no cause of death found

222
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,143
For elementary school teacher
diane choksondik.

223
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,934
However, doctors say
that during the autopsy,

224
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:08,167
They did find semen
in her stomach!

225
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,065
They found
the sea men!

226
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,567
It's only a matter of time
before they find the women too!

227
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:13,699
The autopsy is ongoing,

228
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,234
And cause of death
has yet to be determined.

229
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:17,599
Oh god!
We're dead!

230
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:18,766
Oh jesus,
that's it, man!

231
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,767
I want nothing more
to do with you guys!

232
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,051
Tweek, where
are you going?

233
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,265
They're gonna
find you out!

234
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
And when they do i don't wanna
be within 50 feet of you!

235
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,933
You're gonna fry, man!

236
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:27,699
Hey, tweek, you're in this
just as much as we are!

237
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,334
What? I told you not to put
the sea people in her coffee!

238
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,766
I wasn't even there
when you did it!

239
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:34,667
Yeah, but you're our new friend
and that makes you co-Pee-Able.

240
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:35,998
In fact, it makes you
the most responsible.

241
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,834
Tweek, you might have to
take the fall on this one.

242
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:38,901
Argghhh!

243
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,599
Well, hello there,
children!

244
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,284
Chef, we did
something kind of bad.

245
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,899
We don't know
who else to talk to!

246
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh, i'm sure your
little cracker problems

247
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:52,200
Ain't all that bad.

248
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:54,532
Come on in.

249
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,200
Now just sit down
and take a deep breath

250
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,032
And tell ol' chef
what's goin' on.

251
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,217
We need you to promise
not to tell anybody.

252
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:03,367
Now children, every problem
can be worked out.

253
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:04,965
What was it?

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,899
We killed our teacher,

255
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:08,133
And they found our
sea men in her stomach.

256
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,666
Oh children,
that's a problem

257
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,632
We all have to face
one time or another.

258
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:16,033
Here, let me sing you a little
song that might cheer you up.

259
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,432
* sometimes you
kill your teacher *

260
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,901
* and they find your
semen in her stomach *

261
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,368
* and the-
Wait, what?

262
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,801
So what
should we do?

263
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,417
Wow, i guess this
really is a big deal.

264
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,943
We've only got
one option, you guys.

265
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,434
We're gonna have to
go to the hospital

266
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:41,384
Where they're
doing the autopsy,

267
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,300
And get our sea men
back ourselves!

268
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:44,466
Aghagh!

269
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,365
I pulled out my hair!

270
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,866
Okay, how 'bout this, dougie?

271
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,098
I am going to pose
as a real estate agent,

272
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,801
And con everyone in town
into buying a monorail,

273
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:55,601
And then skip town
with all their money!

274
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,632
No?

275
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:00,400
Simpsons did it-
They did it in episode 204.

276
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,965
Okay, then i'm going to
start a website

277
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,033
To spread vicious rumors
about everyone in town!

278
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:05,965
And then-

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,899
Simpsons did it.

280
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,833
I'll bury a skeleton
wearing angel wings

281
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,367
So that the townspeople will
think a fallen angel has-

282
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,734
Simpsons did it.

283
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,065
This is it.

284
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,534
Alright, everyone scatter
and look for the sea men.

285
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,518
Tweek, stay by the door
and keep a look out.

286
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,467
If you see anybody coming
say the code word:

287
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,584
'Hammer time'.

288
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:24,632
Hammer time?

289
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,501
Can't the code word
just be 'look out'?

290
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:27,799
I won't remember
'hammer time'!

291
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,934
Just remember the song
'can't touch this'

292
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,267
And you'll remember
the code word!

293
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,384
Yeah stupid!

294
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,467
Oh god!

295
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,466
There's nothing here.

296
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,534
Dude, it's probably
still in her stomach.

297
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,566
Is it her?

298
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,334
Yeah, it's
ms. Choksondik, alright.

299
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,132
What do we do now?

300
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,367
Just reach in there and get
the sea men out of her stomach.

301
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh god, you guys
are such pussies.

302
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:56,766
Agh!

303
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:57,965
You guys!

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,534
Ham... hamma... i can't
remember the code word!

305
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:04,368
Can you see
the sea people?

306
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,167
No, just a bunch of goo.

307
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:07,199
You guys!
Uh...

308
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,133
* dun dun-Dun-Dun,
dun-Dun dun-Dun *

309
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:08,933
* can't touch this

310
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,133
* dun dun-Dun-Dun,
dun-Dun dun-Dun *

311
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:10,799
* can't touch this

312
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:11,334
Mrs. Choksondik
stinks inside.

313
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,998
Yeah.

314
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,234
* dun dun-Dun-Dun, dun-Dun
dun-Dun can't touch this *

315
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:17,218
Stop- Hammer time!

316
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:19,167
Agh!
Quick, hide!

317
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:25,634
Well, at least we
got shannon sharpe back.

318
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,567
Alright, let's just leave the
semen sample next to the corpse.

319
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,400
I want to run a
hair & fiber test next.

320
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,734
Hey, do you
smell children?

321
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:37,534
No...

322
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,767
Got it, let's go!

323
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,567
Blgh!Agh!
Ugh!

324
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,566
Bring the world cup
to south park

325
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,651
So that a huge soccer riot
can destroy-

326
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,443
Simpsons did it!
Simpsons did it!

327
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,165
Take all the beer cans
in south park

328
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,534
And have them shaken up in a
huge mixer at the paint store

329
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,933
So that they-

330
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,300
Episode 9f17 entitled
'so it's come to this'.

331
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:04,566
Fine!

332
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,267
Then maybe i'll just forget
about destroying the town,

333
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:09,267
And just run away
and join the circus!

334
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,834
Simpsons did it.

335
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,067
Aaagh!

336
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:20,065
There, we just put
the sea people back

337
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,367
In the tank with the others,
and nobody will ever know.

338
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:23,965
The blood is washed
neatly from our hands.

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,701
Alright, children, i got you
four tickets to thailand

340
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:27,866
And 300 dollars cash.

341
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,701
It's gonna be
tough livin' for a while,

342
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,501
You might have to do
some things for money

343
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:32,968
You never thought of
doing before.

344
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:33,998
It's alright, chef.

345
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,534
We got our sea people
out of the teacher's stomach,

346
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,601
And we put them back
in their aquarium.

347
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,499
Wait... what?
"Sea people"?

348
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,167
The sea people that we
put in the teacher's coffee!

349
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:45,434
Uh, maybe you better
start from the beginning.

350
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,801
...and then we put them
back in the tank.

351
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,265
Oh, children,
you misunderstood!

352
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,200
Sea people is
different from se-Men!

353
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,232
It is?

354
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,334
Yes, that stuff that was
in that vial

355
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,332
Didn't come from you,

356
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,717
It came from
someone else!

357
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:59,032
And i thought
you children

358
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,400
Took turns raping and then
murdered the teacher.

359
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,866
Ha ha ha.

360
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:05,200
Well if they found somebody
else's se-Men in her stomach

361
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:06,133
Maybe they'll find
our sea people too!

362
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,998
Relax, children!

363
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,499
Drinking some brine shrimp
can't kill you!

364
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:12,300
Your teacher must have died
from something else!

365
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,466
Oh really?

366
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,234
Agh!
I'm so relieved!

367
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,065
Aaaghh!

368
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,017
Alright, you children
have had a long night.

369
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,092
Why don't we all get some rest,
and on monday,

370
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,133
I'll sing you a song
explaining the difference

371
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,766
Between semen
and sea people.

372
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:27,000
Come on, children,
i'll walk you all home.

373
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:27,434
Okay, g'night cartman.

374
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,132
'Night, guys.

375
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,467
I'm so glad
we're not murderers.

376
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:37,968
Ah, it's so great that
everything is back to normal.

377
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:55,434
You guys, come quick,
you won't believe it!

378
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:56,833
Oh no, what now?

379
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,767
Those sea men from the teacher's
stomach somehow combined with

380
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,067
The remaining sea people
we had left in the tank and...

381
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,133
Well look!

382
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:07,133
Whoa!

383
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,199
How?

384
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,365
How did that happen?

385
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,833
I've been up for hours
doing some calculations,

386
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,968
And i've come up with my final
theory of composite dynamics:

387
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:21,768
Sea people plus sea men
equals... sea ciety.

388
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:25,534
Whoa... they've already
accomplished so much!

389
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:26,866
They're like bacteria!

390
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:28,500
Small organisms live
much faster lives

391
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,100
And do things at
a much faster rate.

392
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:30,965
That's right, tweek.

393
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,334
If my theory is correct,
all we need is to

394
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,618
Get more of the
two reacting agents

395
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:34,868
And we can really
see them thrive!

396
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,065
Tweek!
Agh!

397
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,367
You go and send away for more
sea people from the magazine ad.

398
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,151
Get at least 5 gallons
of them here, stat!

399
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,901
Stan and kyle, you go find
a bigger fish tank

400
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:42,666
To put them all in!

401
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,866
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

402
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,884
Me? I'm going to
go out on the town

403
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,868
And find ten gallons
of sea men.

404
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,399
I have done it,
general disarray.

405
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,033
I've watched all 132
episodes of 'the simpsons'.

406
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:53,933
Twice.

407
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:54,801
And i have finally
come up with something

408
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,532
That they have never done.

409
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,199
Behold, this device
that i made,

410
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:00,334
Will take the cherries out of
chocolate covered cherries

411
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,268
And replace
the inside instead,

412
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,132
With 2-Month-Old
mayonnaise!

413
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,965
People will think
they are going to

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,666
Get a bite of a
sweet, delicious cherry,

415
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,567
But instead they get a mouthful
of yucky, sticky mayonnaise!

416
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,933
Ha ha haaaa haaaa!

417
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:16,532
You've never seen this
on the simpsons, right?

418
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:19,133
No, i think the simpsons
would be more clever than that.

419
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,265
Good!

420
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,732
Then let us take
my machine outside

421
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:26,100
And make society finally
pay for shunning us!

422
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,432
Tonight on 'the simpsons'!

423
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,998
It's a laugh-A-Rama
when bart builds a machine

424
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:32,434
That takes the cherries out of
chocolate covered cherries

425
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:36,000
And replaces it
instead with mayonnaise.

426
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,951
No... no, it can't be!

427
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,868
Uh-Oh,
simpsons did it!

428
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:40,934
Simpsons did it!

429
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,232
No... no!

430
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,517
Simpsons did it!

431
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,767
Simpsons did it!

432
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,098
Aaagh!

433
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,300
Don't have a cow, man.

434
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:49,634
Oh sweet jesus!

435
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:57,833
Can i help you?

436
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,300
Yes, my mommy told me
that this is where

437
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,534
I could find
some sea men.

438
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:01,399
Your... mom told you?

439
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,032
Do you have
them or not?

440
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,200
We sell semen, yes, but
not normally to children.

441
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,918
What's your name?

442
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:08,443
Francis bellman.

443
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:09,899
Francis, let's talk.

444
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,232
I don't wanna bunch of
bullcrap from you,

445
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:12,667
And you don't want a bunch of
bullcrap from me, right?

446
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:13,965
Where does that
get us- Nowhere.

447
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,834
The truth is i am completely
certified to handle sea men,

448
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,165
And though i may
appear young,

449
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,968
I'm one of the leading sea men
authorities of the midwest.

450
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,432
Up and comer, you know
what i'm saying.

451
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,467
Have my own business soon and
i'll need people to help me run it,

452
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:23,532
I'm talking
about you, francis,

453
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,934
And i'm talking about
a six figure income,

454
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,098
How's that sound?

455
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,300
Everything we supply
is by the quarter ounce.

456
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,133
One donor, certified
and on record.

457
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:33,884
I see, very interesting.

458
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,566
What are you doing?

459
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,667
Let's take a look here...

460
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:41,634
Seems like quality stuff
you got here, francis.

461
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,132
Yeah, good texture,
nice consistency.

462
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,901
The sea men must be alive
and healthy in there.

463
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:46,668
I'll take five.

464
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,102
Five?
Vials?

465
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:49,466
No, gallons.

466
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:50,632
We don't have
that much here.

467
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,000
Dammit, give me
all you got then!

468
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,701
Aaahghh!

469
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,399
No!
No!

470
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,250
Simpsons did it!

471
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,067
Simpsons did it!

472
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,299
Aaaahhh!

473
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,400
Hey, let me on,
let me on!

474
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:15,467
Sit down
and shut up!

475
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,467
Aaaagh!

476
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Butters, have you
seen mr. Hat?

477
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:22,033
Hello there, children!

478
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,867
Aaaaaaghg!

479
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,632
Nooooooo!

480
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,200
What the hell's
wrong with him?

481
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,767
Look the sea people
have evolved to an

482
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,998
Egyptian-Like culture!

483
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,267
Soon they'll discover
frozen foods- Agh!

484
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:37,032
That should be
enough water, kyle.

485
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,234
You got the new
sea people packets, tweek?

486
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:40,399
Well, drop 'em in!

487
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,032
And i've got
the sea men...

488
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,901
Wow, that's a lot of sea men
you got there, cartman.

489
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,265
Yeah, i bought all
that i could at this bank,

490
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,234
And then i got the rest from
this guy ralph in an alley.

491
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,265
That's cool.

492
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,165
Yeah, and the
sweet thing is,

493
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
The stupid asshole didn't even
charge me money for it!

494
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,200
He just made me close my eyes
and suck it out of a hose.

495
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,332
Ha...

496
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,866
There we go...

497
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,934
Okay, now let's put
the sea-Ciety in its new home!

498
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,801
Nothing to do now
but wait...

499
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,300
Close your eyes and
suck it out of a hose?

500
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:11,968
Uh-Huh, suck it out
of a hose, yup.

501
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:12,667
Huh.
Huh.

502
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,299
Oh my god...

503
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:26,384
Their tiny underwater
civilization

504
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,399
Has advanced
hundreds of years!

505
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:32,667
Look, there's a library
and a temple and a...

506
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:37,632
Oh... they think i'm god...

507
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:41,133
Yyyyyyes, i am god
of the sea people!

508
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:42,165
You hear that?

509
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,566
I am god of
the sea people!

510
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:48,267
I am master of
the great sunken empire!

511
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,699
Mom!

512
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm god of
the sea people!

513
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,267
That's nice, poopie.

514
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,532
...and in other
south park news,

515
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,367
Elementary school teacher
ms. Choksondick's autopsy

516
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:05,551
Has shown that
the semen in her stomach

517
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,666
Belonged to
school counselor, mr. Mackey.

518
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:10,567
However, the semen apparently
did not contribute to the death,

519
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:13,968
And so mr. Mackey's identity
is to remain anonymous.

520
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:14,699
Hey, butters!

521
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,265
Hey, what are
you doing, man?

522
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,067
Cartman said he has something
really cool to show everybody!

523
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:18,934
You gotta come.

524
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,285
Cartman?

525
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,601
Ha ha!

526
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:26,065
Behold!

527
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,667
You see my tiny minions
groveling at my likeness!

528
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,599
I am eric cartman, god.

529
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,332
Hey, we paid for
the sea people too,

530
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:33,200
How come they're not
making statues of us?

531
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:35,332
Be you not jealous, jew.

532
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,000
I am creator
of all things, yea.

533
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,599
That is very
impressive, eric,

534
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,601
What do you intend to do
with your underwater society?

535
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:42,201
I am going to send
a message to my people

536
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:43,951
And tell them to
develop a great machine

537
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,726
That will shrink me
down to their size

538
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,467
So i can live
amongst them forever!

539
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:48,532
A ha!

540
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,267
A- Ha-Ahahahaaa!

541
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,834
What the hell is
wrong with you, butters?

542
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,367
They did that
on the simpsons!

543
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,732
Ha!

544
00:19:56,767 --> 00:19:59,450
'Treehouse of horror' episode
4f-02- 'The genesis tub'!

545
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,133
Lisa loses a tooth and the
bacteria on it starts to grow

546
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,466
And makes
a little society

547
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,701
And they build a statue of her
thinking she's god!

548
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:06,365
Ha!

549
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,133
Ha-Ha-Ha!

550
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,165
So?
Yeah, so?

551
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,968
Dude, the simpsons has done
everything already, who cares?

552
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,200
They've been on for
like thirteen years.

553
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:15,868
Of course they've
done everything.

554
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,501
Every idea has
been done butters,

555
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:18,399
Even before the simpsons.

556
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,732
Yeah, in fact,
that episode was

557
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,167
A rip-Off of
a twilight zone episode.

558
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,432
Really?

559
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:25,501
So i shouldn't care
if i come up with an idea

560
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,601
And the simpsons
already did it...

561
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:31,100
It... doesn't matter!

562
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,317
Everything is
back to normal!

563
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,766
I think...
i think i can go back

564
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,901
To trying to
destroy the world again!

565
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,866
Good for you!

566
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:39,884
Yeah, that's
great, butters,

567
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,210
Now get the hell
out of my room.

568
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,466
I feel like
a spring chicken!

569
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,234
I'm ready to
wreak havoc once again!

570
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,632
Hey, look, everybody!

571
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,801
The other side of the aquarium
is building another statue!

572
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,817
Hey, it's tweek!

573
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,332
Me?
Oh man!

574
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,566
I don't want
to be a god!

575
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,000
That is way
to much pressure!

576
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:57,899
That is bullcrap!

577
00:20:57,934 --> 00:21:00,167
You better stop
worshiping him, sea people!

578
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:02,632
What's going on now?

579
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:03,899
The sea people
from cartman's side

580
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:06,334
Are suicide-Bombing the
buildings on tweek's side!

581
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:07,365
Agh!

582
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,032
Yeah, go!

583
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,566
Now what's happening?

584
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:11,699
The sea people
on tweek's side

585
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,534
Just suicide-Bombed
the cartman statue!

586
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,067
Oh goddammit!

587
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:24,799
Oh no!

588
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,032
Oh, the humanity!

589
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, it was a nice project
while it lasted, boys.

590
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,901
Yeah, but i guess
this proves that

591
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,732
War is the natural
order of life.

592
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,534
Why can't societies
just live in peace?
