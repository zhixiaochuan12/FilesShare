14
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,167
Alright, i'm done.

15
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:40,065
You're done?

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, i've tallied up all the
times you've been naughty

17
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:43,701
And deducted the times
you've been nice.

18
00:00:43,736 --> 00:00:45,098
Yeah, so,
how's it look?

19
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,783
It doesn't look good, eric,
it doesn't look good.

20
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:48,434
But i'll still be getting
presents this year, right?

21
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:51,200
Actually it looks like
this year you're gonna

22
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:53,400
Owe santa 306 presents.

23
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:54,866
What?!

24
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,133
4,312 instances
of being naughty against

25
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:58,534
Three deductions
of being nice.

26
00:00:58,569 --> 00:00:59,801
It's bad.

27
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:00,998
Three?

28
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,133
You didn't deduct
all my nice invoices.

29
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:03,484
Look, what about
this one?

30
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,766
Yes, well, i didn't think

31
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,501
"Hitting clyde in the balls
with slingshot"

32
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:07,965
Really counted as nice.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,901
It was nice for token, he
laughed for like 20 minutes.

34
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,551
You can't deduct things
like that, eric,

35
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:13,132
Santa will know and
he'll come after you.

36
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>God dammit, i have to get
that haibo robot doll,</i>

37
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,299
You son of a bitch!

38
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:17,267
Hey, i'm just your
naughty or nice accountant,

39
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:19,051
Don't blame me
for the numbers!

40
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:20,726
Haven't you seen
the haibo doll?

41
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,332
It's like a pet,
a robot pet.

42
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,367
You have to feed it and pet it
or else it dies,

43
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,367
And it's the coolest
thing ever!

44
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:26,833
Santa has to
bring me one!

45
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:28,084
Well, look, aren't there
any other nice things

46
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,300
You've done recently
we can write off here?

47
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:32,799
Oh! I brushed
my teeth last night.

48
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,300
Brushing your teeth isn't
naughty or nice, eric.

49
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:36,334
It just falls more into
the category of

50
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:38,566
"Brushing your teeth".

51
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,934
Well, there's still time
before christmas.

52
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,833
Can't i still
make up for it?

53
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,334
<i>If you cured cancer
and aids next week,</i>

54
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,133
You would still owe
two presents.

55
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:47,132
Jesus christ!

56
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,700
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to find a way to do

57
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,234
The nicest, greatest thing
anyone has ever done.

58
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,332
Ever.

59
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,799
Good evening, everyone.

60
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,534
In a moment we'll be lighting
the south park christmas tree

61
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,234
To kick off
the holidays!

62
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,566
Hooray!

63
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,334
Christmas tree!
Christmas tree!

64
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:05,767
Christmas tree!

65
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:06,766
Hi, guys!

66
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,701
A very merry christmas
to you!

67
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,432
God bless us,
every one!

68
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,833
What are you doing,
cartman?

69
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,267
I'm just letting you guys know
how special you are to me.

70
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:14,599
But now before
we light the tree

71
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,650
I think we should all
reflect for a moment

72
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:18,632
On those who are
less fortunate than us.

73
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,400
Right now in iraq
there are children who fear us

74
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,184
And what we might do
to their country.

75
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,899
The threat of war
touches us all-

76
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,567
But over in iraq,
there is no christmas.

77
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:28,532
They have nothing.

78
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,434
I hate when the mayor
uses christmas

79
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:32,100
For her own political
agenda-

80
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,351
Light the damn tree!

81
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,532
Yeah!

82
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,367
Christmas tree!
Christmas tree!

83
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:37,534
Oh my god-
That's it.

84
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:38,499
What's it?

85
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,799
Don't you see?

86
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,267
This time of year,
we should be bringing christmas

87
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:42,501
To the less fortunates!

88
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,466
Follow me!

89
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,065
You guys,
come on, right now!

90
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,267
Alright, here to light
the christmas tree

91
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,866
Is a very special
young man

92
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,267
Who shows us all the true
meaning of christmas-

93
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,434
Jimmy!

94
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,466
Wow, what a
terrific audience.

95
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,267
Thank you for giving me
this great honor, mayor.

96
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:01,866
Before i l-L-Light
the tree

97
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,267
I was wondering if i could
sing my favorite

98
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:06,534
C- Christmas song
real quick?

99
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,933
Aww!Aww!

100
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:10,267
Well, we'd love a christmas
song, wouldn't we, folks?

101
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:13,033
Christmas songs!
Christmas songs!

102
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,766
Alright, here it goes.

103
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:20,466

00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,234
* a par...
a par... *

109
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh, no.

110
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:43,734
And here's some old toys
that i don't need anymore!

111
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,200
And here, here are some
christmas cookies!

112
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,499
And some holly
and mistletoe!

113
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:48,901
Oh, this will be
the happiest christmas

114
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:50,332
The middle east
has ever seen!

115
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,984
Guys, get those lights down
from the door.

116
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,601
We'll give them to
the needy iraqis too!

117
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:54,866
Cartman, why are you
doing this?

118
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,334
They don't have
christmas there, guys,

119
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,699
We have to
give it to them.

120
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:58,734
That's a retarded idea
that won't work-

121
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,267
Why are you
really doing this?

122
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,434
Hoooowdy ho!

123
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:07,399
Mr. Hankey!

124
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,167
Oh, i hate that stupid
christmas poo.

125
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,599
Hello, mr. Hankey!

126
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,899
A merry christmas
to you!

127
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,267
Gee whiz, things sure look
christmassy out here!

128
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:16,466
What are you boys doing?

129
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:17,867
Cartman is trying to
bring christmas to iraq.

130
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:19,234
The people of iraq deserve
a good christmas

131
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,000
Just like
everyone else.

132
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,065
Well, gosh, eric,

133
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,667
Looks like you really have
the christmas spirit!

134
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:30,067
I know someone who can help-
Santa claus!

135
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,232
Really?

136
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,699
Really?
Really?

137
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,000
Sure, we should take this stuff
to him right away!

138
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,033
But how are we gonna
get to the north pole?

139
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,732
Oh, that's no problem!

140
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,534
We just need a little
christmas magic!

141
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,400
All aboard
the poo-Choo express!

142
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,032
Wow!

143
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:56,984
Ooh, that smells.
Yeah.

144
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,866
Next stop
the north pole!

145
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,034
Get the rest of the
stuff, you guys!

146
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,167
Uh, i don't really
wanna get on that.

147
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:03,232
Me neither.

148
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,400
You guys, we have to
bring christmas

149
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,868
To those less
fortunates!

150
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:06,632
Now come on!

151
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,234
Let's go,
poo-Choo train!

152
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,000
Poo-Chooo!

153
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,667
* the poo-Choo train's
laying down its tracks *

154

* poo-Choo train
is my favorite thing *

157
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,050
* spreading christmas joy
as we ride and sing *

158
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,534
Dude, what the hell has
gotten into cartman?

159
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:26,899
I don't know.

160
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:28,933
* christmas time
wouldn't be the same *

161
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:34,501
* without hugs and kisses
and a poo-Choo train *

162
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:39,167
* and a partridge
in a p-P... *

00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:43,965
* pear t-T-Tree

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,767
* on the third day
of c-Chri... chri... *

165
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:54,434
Here we are, kids,
the north pole!

166
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,299
Finally!

167
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,499
God,
it took forever!

168
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,267
Wow, is that
where santa lives?

169
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,599
That's it-

170
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:04,467
Santa's fortress
of solitude!

171
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,265
Mr. Hankey!

172
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,166
We need to see santa
right away

173
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:13,033
On urgent
christmas business.

174
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,200
Sure thing!

175
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,467
Hey, aren't you guys the
underpants gnomes?

176
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:19,532
10 months
out of the year.

177
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,834
But this time of year
we help santa!

178
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:23,165
Here he is!

179
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,334
Ho ho ho!
Merry christmas!

180
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,466
Wow!Wow!Wow!

181
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,132
Howdy ho, santa!

182
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,800
Mr. Hankey,
how are you?

183
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,399
All ready
for christmas?

184
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,833
I was just starting
to look over

185
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:37,300
The new naughty and nice list
the gnomes prepared for me.

186
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:38,599
Oh, heh...

187
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,265
Are the tabulations
all closed off then?

188
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,834
Oh, no, they keep it open until
midnight of christmas eve.

189
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,584
Some kids actually
try to cram in

190
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,300
A lot of niceness
right at the end.

191
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:49,998
Ho, that's so
lame of them.

192
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,234
Santa, my friends are
trying to do something

193
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:53,334
Very special
this christmas.

194
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,466
Tell him, eric.

195
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,899
Well santa,
it's just that-

196
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,417
I was thinking about
all the people in iraq

197
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,866
Who are afraid that
we might bomb them.

198
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,599
And i just thought-
Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt

199
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:05,434
To send them a little bit of our
christmas spirit as well.

200
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,299
You know,
you're right.

201
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:10,900
Santa hasn't been to that part
of the world in a long time.

202
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:14,467
Perhaps santa could bring peace
to this whole situation!

203
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:15,532
That's what
i thought.

204
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,167
Gnomes, load up the sleigh
with toys!

205
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,767
Santa's going to make
a special run!

206
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:21,998
Alright!

207
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:25,834
And you boys can all watch me
from our flight control room.

208
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,632
Hooray!

209
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:33,334
* and a p-P-Partridge
in a p-Pear tree *

210
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,699
* on the f-Fourth day
of ch-Ch- *

211
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:42,467
* christmas my t-True
love ga-Gave to m-M-Meee *

212
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:47,165
This is santa's
flight control center.

213
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,283
From here, we can monitor
santa from satellite

214
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,367
As he travels the globe
delivering presents!

215
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,699
Wow, cool!

216
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:57,400
It looks like santa's
already made it to baghdad!

217
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,434
Ho ho ho!
Merry christmas everyone!

218
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,701
Ho ho ho!
A merry christmas to all!

219
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:12,833
<i>Derka derka derka!</i>

220
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,000
<i>Hala derka
berka derka!</i>

221
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:17,133
Merry christmas!

222
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,501
I'm hit!
I'm hit!

223
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,199
Sleigh is hit!
Sleigh is hit!

224
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:28,234
Instrument failure
at 0600 feet!

225
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,050
The sleigh's going down!

226
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,899
Sleigh is going down.

227
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,367
Sleigh is
going down!

228
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,799
Hang on, santa!

229
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,400
Sleigh one is going down.

230
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,866
It is going down.

231
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,033
Alert ground troops
to stand by.

232
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,934
We got a red sleigh down,
we got a red sleigh down.

233
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,467
Red sleigh one,
this is north pole.

234
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:07,200
Red sleigh one,
this is north pole.

235
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:08,934
Mr. Kringle?

236
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,100
Jesus christ,
they killed him!

237
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,934
No- Santa claus
can't be dead.

238
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,165
He can't.

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,098
Why would iraqis
do that? Why?

240
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,567
It certainly doesn't seem
very christmassy of them.

241
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,401
North pole,
this is santa.

242
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,518
Santa,
are you alright?

243
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:30,601
What is your
status?

244
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,032
Sleigh is down.

245
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,399
Reindeer... all dead.

246
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:38,267
Both santa's legs
are broken.

247
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:40,251
Santa's...
very sad.

248
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,165
Santa will have to-

249
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,717
Oh no-
They're coming for me.

250
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,234
Stay back,
you bastards!

251
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,701
Stay back!

252
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,699
Oh, no.

253
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:53,634
Well, what are you gnomes
sitting there for?

254
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:54,998
You have to go
rescue him!

255
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:56,434
What the hell are we
supposed to do?

256
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,866
We're like
nine inches tall!

257
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,634
Now i'm never gonna get
my haibo robot doll!

258
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,032
Is that what
this is all about?!

259
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,701
You came up with this whole idea
so you can get a stupid toy?!

260
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,934
It's not stupid, it's a
toy that you can starve!

261
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,567
If you don't feed it,
it dies!

262
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:09,399
It's so cool!

263
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,399
Well, good going,
asshole!

264
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:12,834
Thanks to you, there's not
gonna be any christmas,

265
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:14,400
And there's no one left
to help us!

266
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:16,599
Oh, christ.

267
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,399
Jesus!Jesus!Jesus!

268
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:22,300
Hey, that's right-
Jesus can save anybody!

269
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,432
Follow me!

270
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,801
You can take santa's
backup sleigh!

271
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:34,968
* on the f-F-Fifth day
of c-C-Christmas *

272
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:41,466

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,165
We fed jesus christ's data
into the auto pilot-

277
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,467
The sleigh should be able
to take you right to him!

278
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,734
I hope so, or else santa
clause is as good as dead.

279
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,065
Here it is,
red sleigh two.

280
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,968
Come on, gang, it's up
to us to save christmas!

281
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,434
Tell santa's workers
to keep making toys-

282
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,067
We'll have santa back
in no time!

283
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,432
Uh, how do we
start this thing?

284
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,400
You just have to call out
the reindeer's names!

285
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:22,632
Oh yeah!

286
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,200
On dasher, on prancer,
on comet-

287
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:25,899
No, no-
They're all dead!

288
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,566
You have to call out
the new ones!

289
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,684
On steven, on fluffy,
on horris and chantel!

290
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,767
On skippy and rainbow
and patches and montel!

291
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,501
Good luck
finding jesus!

292
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,133
Wow, look, you guys, we're
riding in santa's sleigh!

293
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,501
We should be able to find
jesus in no time!

294
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,365
* i'm riding in
santa's sleigh *

295
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,734
* so high above the trees
at christmas time *

296
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,567
* with candy cane wishes
and smiles- *

297
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,065
What are you doing?

298
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,601
I'm having a precious
christmas time moment, kyle,

299
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,032
If you don't mind.

300
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,098
Singing a christmas song

301
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,534
Isn't gonna get you
nice deductions, cartman!

302
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:00,851
Don't forget
it's because of you

303
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,098
That santa's sleigh
got shot down!

304
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,616
It isn't my fault that iraqis
are filled with hate!

305
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,100
All i'm saying is it's gonna
take a lot of singing

306
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,933
To make up for that!

307
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,367
* it's christmas magic time
on santa's sleigh *

308
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:10,799

Where are you
taking me?

316
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,667
<i>Klak bakala kala!</i>

317
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:42,100
You are all being
very naughty.

318
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:47,399
Why you come to iraq,
my main man?

319
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,901
To bring happiness and joy
to the children.

320
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,199
And this is-

321
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:54,484
This is what you think
brings happy?

322
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,734
This is material.
This is commercialism.

323
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,799
Your country
is sick... sick.

324
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:02,434
No, your country has just
lost all its christmas spirit.

325
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,332
What's going on here?

326
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,434
America wants to bomb
my house, my main man.

327
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,384
They want to kill
my wife and children.

328
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:11,110
We need to know-
What is their plan?

329
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:13,801
I don't know, i live in
the north pole!

330
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,265
What are you doing?

331
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,933
They say that the chinese
were the first

332
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:23,601
To experiment with electro-Shock
to the testicles.

333
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,267
Oh no...
not santa's balls!

334
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,133
What else is
america planning?!

335
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,566
I'm gonna
kill you!

336
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,968
You're not in a position to
kill anyone, my main man.

337
00:13:43,003 --> 00:13:45,167
I just want you to
tell me america's plan!

338
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,851
Then we're in
for a long night

339
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:50,501
Because i don't know

340
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,216
<i>In nome del mio, padre,
sia guarito.</i>

341
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:59,998
<i>Benedicali, jesus,
benedicali.</i>

342
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,817
<i>Jesus, mio bambino
non puo sentirsi.</i>

343
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,601
<i>Il vostro bambino
sara giusto.</i>

344
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,365
<i>Bene, benedicali!</i>

345
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,333
Ahhhh!

346
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:11,232
Ahhh!

347
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,167
<i>La morte rossa!</i>

348
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,167
Hooowdy ho!

349
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,666
Jesus!

350
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,251
Stan, kyle, mr. Hankey
and eric cartman-

351
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,766
What are you doing here,
my children?

352
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,133
Jesus, santa's sleigh was
shot down over iraq!

353
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:28,567
Santa?
Is he alright?

354
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,799
We don't know.

355
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,067
They lost all contact
with him.

356
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,300
We have to get him
out of there.

357
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:33,566
Do you know a way?

358
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,365
Yes.
Yes, i think i do.

359
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
We need a little
christmas miracle.

360
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,065
Lock and load.
We're going in!

361
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,334
* on the s-S-Seventh day
of christmas *

362
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:55,467
* my tr-Tr-True love... *

363
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:02,000
You're a sick capitalist
dog, my main man.

364
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,165
This is baghdad?

365
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,699
God, what a
- Hole.

366
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:11,100
I mean- Oh wow, these poor
unfortunate people!

367
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,734
Red sleigh two,
two come in.

368
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:13,799
We're here!

369
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:14,767
You're coming up on the
source of the signal.

370
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,265
You're right on
top of him!

371
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,234
He must be in that
building below us.

372
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:19,567
Land it on the roof,
mr. Hankey.

373
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,200
Howdy ho, jesus.

374
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,732
<i>Kak bala?!</i>

375
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,150
Wait here,

376
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,409
<i>Keem kala?
Keeem kak bala!</i>

377
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,439
Yea, look upon me

378
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,399
<i>Halak bala!
Kleem bala!</i>

379
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,000
My children, you should
know something-

380
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,501
I'm packing.

381
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,799
Let's go!

382
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,567
This is such a magical
christmas adventure, you guys.

383
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:53,467
* on the e-E-Eleventh day
of c-Christmas *

384
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:58,868
* my t-True love
gave to m-M-Me *

385
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:04,234
* eleven p-P-Pipers
p- P-Piping... *

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,466
Drink it!
Drink the oil!

387
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,334
This is all you western
capitalists want!

388
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,100
Jesus christ!

389
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,365
Aah!

390
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,234
Thank, thank god
for you, jesus.

391
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,232
Here-
Can you walk?

392
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,367
Santa's legs
are broken.

393
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,267
They are healed.

394
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,165
Santa.

395
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,532
I just couldn't do it.

396
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,967
I just couldn't
let him live.

397
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,367
He shocked
santa's balls!

398
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,234
More soldiers
are coming!

399
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,232
Let's move- Move!

400
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:52,267
* eight maids
of m-Milking... *

401
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,367
Get up the stairs!
The sleigh is on the roof!

402
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,667
Jesus!
Behind you!

403
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,651
Jesus!

404
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:07,968
Ahhagahg!

405
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,300
Jesus?
Jesus?

406
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,267
Don't, don't worry, jesus,
it's nothing.

407
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,632
Just a scratch.

408
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,065
You're a...
bad liar.

409
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,334
Hey- But we sure gave 'em
one hell of a fight, huh?

410
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,532
We sure did, jesus.

411
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:30,467
Dude, this is pretty
up right here.

412
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,234
Santa-
I'm here, jesus.

413
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,933
Don't, don't ever-

414
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,200
Let them take away-
Our christmas spirit.

415
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,334
Oh my god-
Iraqis killed jesus.

416
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,467
You bastards.

417
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,734
Come on, kids!

418
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,567
Get to the sleigh!
Get to the sleigh!

419
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,365
Start the sleigh!

420
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,234

421
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,399

423
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:19,701
* look at me, i'm riding high
in santa's sleigh *

424
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,200
* it's a christmas
special time for me- *

425
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,032
Oh shut up, cartman!

426
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,267
Your sweet christmas act
isn't fooling anybody!

427
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:26,566
It's not an act,
kyle!

428
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,367
All i wanted was for these
people to understand

429
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:29,868
What christmas means.

430
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,299
You're right, kid.

431
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:33,365
What are you
doing, santa?

432
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,100
I came to bring
christmas to iraq,

433
00:18:36,135 --> 00:18:38,534
And by god
i'm gonna do it!

434
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,734
Ho ho ho!
Merry christmas!

435
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:04,501
R.P.G. 4:00!

436
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,234
Boy, things are sure starting
to look christmassy now!

437
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,133
Merry christmas!
Ho ho ho!

438
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,933
Merry christmas to all!

439
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:34,117
And to all a good night!
Ho ho ho ho ho

440
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:41,267
* and a p-Partridge
in a p-Pear treeeee *

441
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:44,532
That's it?

442
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,400
That's it!
The song's over!

443
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,267
We can light the tree!

444
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:50,450
Oh, finally!

445
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:51,632
Go on, jimmy!

446
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:55,367
There's only five more seconds
until christmas.

447
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,399
Awwwww!

448
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:04,133
Christmas is
ruined again!

449
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:09,200
Ho ho ho!

450
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,801
Stan!

451
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:16,866
Kyle!

452
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:18,300
Mom! Dad!
We rode in santa's sleigh!

453
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,868
We brought christmas
to iraq!

454
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:20,833
Everyone!

455
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:23,234
Everyone, can i please
have your attention?

456
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,784
Christmas is a very special
time of year,

457
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,265
But this year it almost
didn't happen.

458
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,968
There's a man named jesus who
gave his life to save me.

459
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:34,968
And so, i declare that
every year on christmas day

460
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:38,334
We should remember jesus
for what he did

461
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,098
And thank him for it.

462
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:44,234
From now on, christmas will be
a day for remembering

463
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,400
A brave man
named jesus.

464
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,450
Now if you'll all
excuse me,

465
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,634
I've got a lot of work
to do.

466
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,566
I'll help you, santa!

467
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,567
Oh, and boys,
you might want to check

468
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:59,701
Under the christmas tree!

469
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,801
Ho ho ho!
Merry christmas!

470
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,234
Wow, look, you guys!
Santa got us all haibo dolls!

471
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,899
Aw, god dammit!

472
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:17,467
Cartman, i thought all
you wanted was a haibo doll!

473
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:19,734
Yeah, but not if
you guys have one too!

474
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,566
Now it's worthless
and gay!

475
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,167
God dammit, i'll never
try to be nice again!

476
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:25,432
Well, all in all
i have to say

477
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,234
This was a pretty
special christmas.

478
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:28,901
Hey guys,
what's going on?

479
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:30,098
Oh, hey, kenny.

00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,400
Dude, where
have you been?

481
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:32,632
I've just been
hanging out.

482
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,100
Well, come on, we gotta
tell you what happened!

483
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:35,265
I'm sure glad

484
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,133
Yeah, but i feel like things
are finally back to normal.

485
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:38,567
Yeah!

486
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,834
* the poo-Choo train's
laying down its tracks *

487
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,365
* with a-
Poo-Choo!

488
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,666
* all the way

489
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,065

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,000
