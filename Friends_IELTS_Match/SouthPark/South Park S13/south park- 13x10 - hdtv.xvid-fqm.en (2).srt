Why did they have us
put on long underwear?

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,720
Wul,I guess in wrestling we're supposed to
make your own outfit and then wear it over this.

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
Yeah that makes sense.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,830
Alright.So did everyone settle
on their wrestling names?

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,580

That's because your mother
betrayed my mother,juggernaut!

111
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,770
You don't come to this
country and make fun of it!

112

And just what do you care
about your pitiful country?

Maybe irene lied to you!

125
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,360
That kid in the hat is havingsex

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,920

You cannot fight until
your testresults come back!

131
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,510
I might have to wait
for my hepatitis test,

132
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,250
but in the meantime I have brought my
comrade from mexico to wrestle against you!

Your girlfriend doesn't

She likes me!

140

You have no idea what
you're saying,juggernaut!

141
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,040
Irene loves me and
I'm going to marry her!

142
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,310
If she wants to be with you,

you did two years ago!

155

How you killed his child!

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,860
It's true.I was pregnant with
your child and I aborted it.

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,380
Irene,no!

158
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,710
Why?

159
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,210
Do you know what it's like tohave
an abortion at seven years old?

160
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,870
Do you?

161
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,460
I've had so many abortions.

162
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,990
I just got addicted to them.

163
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,090
Woa,did you hear that?

164
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,570
Irene!You said you loved me!

165
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,130
I'm not in love with you.I'm in love
with abortions,don't you understand?

166
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,740
I'm telling you guys,you
have got to see this.

167
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,080
These kids ain't more
than eightor nine years old

168
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,730
and they got more problems
than you can imagine.

169
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,090
There's this one kid,

170
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,920
he saw his father get murdered.

171
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,570
And yesterday he finds the killer
and it's this other kid who's an excop

172
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,850
needless to say,he whooped his ass good.

173
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,800
Yup.And there's this little girl.

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,830
She's actually addicted
to gettin' abortions.

175
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,290
Got pregnant by nearly every boythere.

176
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,580
You're  me.

177
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,370
No we're tellin' you
these kids are  Crazy.

178
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,690
You gotta check it out.

179
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,370
You can watch'em almost everyafternoon.

180
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,710
It's some of the greatest
wrestlin' we ever seen.

181
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,090
It isn't real.

182
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,280
Don't you people understand?

183
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,110
That stuff isn't real.

184
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,150
None of it!

185
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,240
How stupid are you?

186
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,330
What'ch you mean it ain't real?

187
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,660
It's all made up.Fiction.

188
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,400
Real wrestling is a serious
and respectable sport.

189
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,370
Why can't you people understand that
that kind of wrestling isn't real?

190
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,480
Mister,

191
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,460
there's a little girlout there who's had
14 abortionsand she ain't even 10 yet.

192
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,120
But I guess that's just not realto you.

193
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,250
Son a bitch.

194
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,580
Look!Look!Look!

195
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,220
This is wrestling this!

196
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,700
Mister,you better take your gay
porn and walk right outta this bar.

197
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Holy crap,dude.There's
a huge turnout tonight!

198
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,080
Good thing we made those
changes to the seating.

199
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,830
Alright.You guys let's bring it in.

200
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,120
I think we've really done a great
job and let's just keep the energy up,

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,190
*** **** have a good flow
and have fun out there.**?

202
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,210
Yeah!

203
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,250
Let's do this!

204
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,220
One,two Backyard wrestling!

205
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,730
Oh,what a perfect night for fighting!

206
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,310
Lo,the moon sets upon the
tips of the trees and I,

207
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,350
the man known as the rad russian,

208
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,690
start to stir with the
excitement of violence.

209
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,220
Only a country like yours canbreed
men of such discontent,rad russian!

210
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,960
But you don't know
what real pain is.Pain.

211
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,010
Like I've known.

212
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,330
Abandoned when I was four
years old by my parents.

213
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,680
Left to die in a cold
and dark sewage tunnel.

214
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,030
Geez,I didn't know his parents did that

215
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,790
I am very sorry,

216
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,380
but I'm afraid we have to terminate
youremployment here at south park elementary.

217
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,140
You're firing me?Why?

218
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,780
The school board has decided to
discontinue the wrestling program.

219
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,040
Wrestling simply involves
too much adult subject matter.

220
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,580
Like murder and abortion.

221
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,200
No!This isn't wrastling!

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,650
This isn't wraaastling!

223
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,170
Principal victoria,just let me stay on and
I can teach kids what real wrestling is!

224
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm sorry.The board
has made up their minds.

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,580
You can't fire me for
what these kids do!

226
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,310
That isn't the only
reason you're being let go.

227
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,030
What do you mean?

228
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,950
We...found all the gay porn
on your iphone,mr.Conners.

229
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,910
So I'm thinking we do the part about jimmy's
relationship with his alcoholic father

230
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,690
after you smash butters onto the table.

231
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,120
Oh,sure that works.

232
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
You guys!You guys listen to this!

233
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,270
- It's amazing!
- What,dude?!

234
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,240
We just received a letter from the wwe.

235
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,200
From the professional
wrestlers we saw in denver?!

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,490
No way!

237
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,150
Gentlemen,we have heard of
your wrestling organization

238
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,370
and are quite interested
in its popularity.

239
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,610
The wwe is delighted to inform you
that it will be sending a talent scout,

240
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,160

241

event this saturday,the 24th!

242
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,220
Vince mcmahon is coming to see us?

243
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,800
This is our shot at
making itinto the wwe,

244
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,230
to be real wrestlers!

245
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,470
- Oh my god!Oh my god oh my god!
- We could become pro wrestlers.

246
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,450
I am completely freaking

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,110
ouuuttt.

248
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,440
Ok,guys!Guys listen!

249
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,490
We seriously have to focus here.

250
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,260
We have exactly three days before
the scout is here to see us wrestle.

251
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,770
We've got to step it up and
workit like never before!

252
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,070
Alright.It's time to
start the second act.

253
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,530
Let's bring the crowd
back from intermission,

254
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,090
and then improvisesome
stuff for saturday!

255
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,780
Yeah,no,I think congo
is a great wrestler.

256
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,170
I just think rad russian has hisnumber.

257
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,860
Yeah,but rad russian has a
lot of abandonment issues.

258
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,990
Oh,looks like intermission
is over we better head back.

259
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,900
I left my wife today.

260
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,360
Walked out of the apartment
without saying a word.

261
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,470
I ran away from my responsibilities,

262
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,590
just I like always do.

263
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,590
And I,again,

264
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,240
am alone.

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,730
Here he is!Hiding in
the forest as I told you!

266
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,940
Juggernaut!There is to be an
ultimate smackdown this saturday!

267
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,290
Are you going to run from that as well!

268
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,190
I'll fight anytime anywhere!

269
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,890
He don't run from fights,just
from responsibilities.

270
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,140
What do I do?

271
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,980
Juggernaut is my long lost brother,

272
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,520
and yet congo saved my life in nam!

273
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,130
It's el pollo loco!

274
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,620
El pollo loooco!

275
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,840
Thanks for coming,guys.

276
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,710
I'm sure you're wondering why
I've calleled you to sizzler.

277
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,650
Yeah.What's this about we should
writing our monologues for smackdown.

278
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,480
Well guys,kenny and I have been talking

279
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,490
Yeah,we've been talking.

280
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,770
And,I mean,smackdown might be our one
shot at making it into the wwe,right?

281
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,810
A shot like this might never come again.

282
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,780
- Yeah.
- Well,the way we see it,

283
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,580
we have three primary obstacles
in making smackdown a great show.

284
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,360
- ************
- Yup.

285
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,420
What are you talking about?

286
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,610
Guys,let's face it.They
can't wrestle for crap.

287
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,110
I mean,every time I wrestle with
one of them they flub a line,

288
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,290
or blow their monologue.

289
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,630
And token,he has no emotion,notiming.

290
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,030
He's the worst wrestler I've ever seen.

291
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,290
He's right.

292
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,950
What?Dude,it's really hard to do your best
wrestling when you're up against token.Right?

293
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,700
And butters and jimmy,I
mean,they're okay,

294
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,890
but they're never gonna make
it as professional wrestlers.

295
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,630
Well,so then wwe will
recruit us and not them.

296
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,400
No dude,they're gonna hurt our chances!

297
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,470
They're gonna hurt our chances!

298
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,570
Because we all know

299
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,840
that withall the new material I've
written is stuff those guys can't handle,

300
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,190
and we'll suffer from it.

301
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,300
So what do we do?

302
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,830
We gotta bring somebody else on.

303
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,270
Yup.We gotta bring somebody else on
who can handle the more difficult roles

304
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,710
that we wrestle against
instead of those guys.

305
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,880
Somebody who can do the harder
stuff we've written so that token,

306
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,790
butters and jimmy can
have smaller parts.

307
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,990
How do we find somebody
who can wrestle that well?

308
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,700
It's simple.We just gotta hold tryouts.

309
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,000
Number 17 step forward please.

310
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,310
You're wrestling a muslim immigrant.

311
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,610
You suspect he could be a terrorist and
your parents died in the 9/11 attacks.

312
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,890
Go.

313
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,450
You dirty,muslim bastard!

314
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,510
I don't trust you!

315
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,740
And I never will!

316
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,630
Do you know how it feels
to loseyour parents.

317
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,380
No,you wouldn't,you smelly
brown middle eastern piece of

318
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,050
Thank you.Number 24.

319
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,230
You're wrestling for the right
to marry mackenzie phillips

320
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,960
but just learned that she
had sex with her father.

321
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,480
Go.

322
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,390
Your father?

323
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,520
Your own father?

324
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,090
I don't care if you were
on drugs your sick whore!

325
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,700
Thank you.

326
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,980
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.

327
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
Yeah,yeah not bad.

328
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,180
Let's see.Can we get number
37 to step forward again?

329
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,390
Just want to get to know
you alla little better.

330
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,600
What can you tell us about yourself?

331
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,460
Not a whole lot to tell really.

332
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,950
Was born in fort collins.

333
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,470
Started watching wrestling
when I was four years old.

334
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,720
My father.

335
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,600
he liked it too.

336
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,090
until he died.

337
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,260
sometimes I think it's because
of him I follow this dream.

338
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,110
All my life,all I ever
wanted was to be a wrestler.

339
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,810
Fighting in the ring,winning that belt.

340
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,640
And so I dreamed every night
that I was the undertaker,

341
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,670
smashing skulls in,breaking arms.

342
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,440
Damn dude,that is
some bad ass wrestling.

343
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,320
