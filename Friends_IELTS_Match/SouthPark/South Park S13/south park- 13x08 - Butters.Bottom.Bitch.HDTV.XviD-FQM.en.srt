Season 13 Episode 8
"Dead Celebrities"

2
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,285
You have been very, very naughty.

3
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,925
You're a naughty girl.

4
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:41,918
I've been so naughty.

5
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:44,659
Jeez!

6
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:45,834
What the...

7
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:50,591
Get back to bed right now.

8
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:53,844
I'm scared.
There's a ghost.

9
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,443
Not this again.

10
00:00:55,568 --> 00:00:57,932
We're sick of you
talking about ghosts.

11
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,327
- But, daddy...
- No buts.

12
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:03,437
Get back to your room
and don't come out. You got it?

13
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:08,468
Gerald, what has gotten into him?

14
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:09,751
I don't know.

15
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:12,927
Maybe with all the famous people
dying this summer,

16
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,783
he freaked himself out.

17
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Billy Mays here
for Mega Scrub cleanser.</i>

18
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,261
<i>Are you tired of your kitchen counters
getting those nasty stains?</i>

19
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>Don't just rub them, megascrub them.</i>

20
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:52,836
Billy Mays!

21
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,072
<i>Mold, mildew,
even those impossible wine stains</i>

22
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:01,542
<i>are gone in a flash
when you snipe them away.</i>

23
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,006
Mommy!

24
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,592
Farrah Fawcett!

25
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,535
David Carradine!

26
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,931
<i>Billy Mays here for Mighty MendIt.</i>

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,602
<i>The fast and easy way
to mend, hem and wear it again.</i>

28
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,698
- Ike, what?
- Make Billy Mays go away!

29
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,430
Make Billy Mays go away.

30
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,122
Make him stop.

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,780
Make him stop, Kyle!

32
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,610
Ike, your family
is very worried about you.

33
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,066
Ike, you can talk to me.

34
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,334
I'm a therapist.

35
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,923
Whatever has been troubling you,
it's okay.

36
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,883
It's a secret.

37
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,418
Tell me your secret.

38
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,024
I promise not to tell anyone else.

39
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,786
I see dead celebrities.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,641
You mean you see
dead celebrities on TV in the news?

41
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:19,663
I see them walking around.

42
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,162
They talk to me.

43
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:26,413
Are you seeing
any dead celebrities right now?

44
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,720
Just Ed McMahon.

45
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,674
How often do you see
dead celebrities?

46
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,566
All the time.

47
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:48,666
Sup, Jew.

48
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:51,868
Guys, Ike has gotten worse.
I'm really worried about him.

49
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:54,051
He's still seeing dead celebrities.

50
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:55,816
What a dumb ass.

51
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,172
I don't know. Last night,
We found him in the kitchen pantry.

52
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:03,279
He was screaming
the name Billy Mays over and over.

53
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:04,783
Billy Mays?

54
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,738
You didn't tell us
Ike was seeing Billy Mays.

55
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:11,333
- What?
- He saw the ghost of Billy Mays?

56
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,377
I don't know who that is.

57
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,406
The guy on TV who had
incredible things for people buy.

58
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,282
He died four months ago,
but they still show him all the time.

59
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,021
For the love of Christ.
Here.

60
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,180
Here.
This is him.

61
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:28,559
Billy Mays here
with another fantastic product.

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,980
If you're like other Americans,
you love to eat Chipotle.

63
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,065
But you hate all those blood stains
in your underwear.

64
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,559
I love Chipotle.

65
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:39,570
But getting all the blood stains
out of my underwear is a nightmare.

66
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,410
Now there's a product
that can clean blood stains

67
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,533
caused by Chipotle
off your underwear.

68
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,449
Chipotlaway.

69
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,051
Just one Chipotle burrito
can leave up to a 1/4 cup of blood.

70
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:54,376
But Chipotlaway makes your underwear
clean and ready for more.

71
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,355
Stop buying new underwear
every time you eat Chipotle.

72
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,923
That can cost you thousands.

73
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,885
Chipotlaway gets rid of blood stains
and leaves your underway good as new.

74
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,775
Imagine having underwear so clean
you can eat off of it.

75
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,599
Chipotle.

76
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,851
Now you can eat
all the Chipotle you want

77
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,938
and still have underway
that sparkles and shines.

78
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,393
Order right now!

79
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,731
That product changed my life.

80
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,737
It works.
I use it all the time.

81
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,745
- What? Are you serious?
- Look, Kyle.

82
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,408
If there's a chance
he isn't at rest, I want to help.

83
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,295
Why the hell would you do that?

84
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,136
He was a great person.

85
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,213
Why would you keep eating something
that made you crap blood?

86
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,632
Dude, have you had Chipotle?
It's really good.

87
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:42,755
We have to help Kyle's brother
and get to the bottom of this.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,271
I know just who to call.

89
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,762
<i>On this episode of Ghost Hunters,</i>

90
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,848
<i>a little boy in Colorado
appears to be haunted by celebrities.</i>

91
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,560
<i>The Ghost Hunter team will roll out
and get to the bottom of it.</i>

92
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,771
<i>It's the gayest show

93
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,001
<i>Ghost Hunters!</i>

94
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,442
All right.
What we have this week, Chris?

95
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,445
We're going to Colorado
to investigate celebrity paranormal...

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,445
Wait.
What was that?

97
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,376
I heard it too.
It was like a...

98
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,812
Is there a ghost here?

99
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,499
All right.
A little boy is seeing the ghost?

100
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,584
Apparently only he is seeing them.

101
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,555
What is that?
Do you hear that?

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,147
Look.
What is that?

103
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,078
I think that's a cigarette lighter.

104
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,647
All right.
Okay. Maybe.

105
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:31,159
We're now inside the house
where the ghosts have been spotted.

106
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,589
- What was that?
- What was what?

107
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:37,271
Did you hear that?
It was like a...

108
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,001
Is there a spooky ghost here?

109
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,047
Look. What is that?

110
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:46,002
I'm pretty sure
that's their television.

111
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:47,781
Man, I'm really scared.

112
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:50,983
What is this?

113
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,480
There's a wetness
coming from my pants!

114
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:55,589
- I see it!
- What is it?

115
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:57,291
I'm so scared.

116
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:59,650
- I'm so scared.
- Look.

117
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,052
It's got you, too!

118
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,492
Make sure
the camera is getting this.

119
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,269
Definitely paranormal activity.

120
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:07,042
It's a warm, moist.

121
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,253
A warm, moist sensation
that is moving down my left thigh.

122
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:13,642
Look, it's starting to form
a pool around the floor now.

123
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,047
Are you getting this?

124
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,318
Are you guys fucking serious?

125
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:19,802
The paranormal activity
is now leaving

126
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,940
a trail of some kind
behind both of us.

127
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:27,364
Something hot and warm is coming out
the back of my pants now.

128
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,739
It smells!

129
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,914
You see, Ike?
There's nothing.

130
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:48,290
There's nothing
for you to be afraid of.

131
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:52,299
<i>Billy Mays here
for the Big City Slider Station.</i>

132
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:53,962
It's all in your head.

133
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,256
<i>The fast and easy way

134
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,398
{\*CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF DENVER}

135
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,743
I just don't understand it.

136
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:12,987
It's going to be all right.

137
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,112
But it doesn't make any sense.

138
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:19,773
I mean, If you know it's going
to make you crap blood,

139
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,793
why wouldn't you at least
just try eating less of it?

140
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,379
That's what I'm saying.

141
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,588
You have the Chipotlaway,
so it doesn't matter.

142
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,174
Of course, it matters.
You should be concerned

143
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,548
there's blood in your underwear.
You understand this?

144
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:34,471
I eat Chipotle all the time
and never made me crap blood.

145
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,338
How nice for you, Stan.

146
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:39,852
You have a golden rectum of the gods,
but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.

147
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,929
Boys, little Ike is stable.

148
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,690
But the celebrity ghosts have sent him
into some kind of coma.

149
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,819
Wait.
There really are ghosts?

150
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:50,663
Of course there are.

151
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:52,781
<i>Haven't you seen
that show Ghost Hunters?</i>

152
00:08:53,318 --> 00:08:54,798
But I'm a pediatric doctor,

153
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:57,328
so I'm going to
and this off to Dr. Phillips,

154
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,582
who specializes in spooky things.

155
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,109
The ghost of the celebrities

156
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,733
are in deep unrest.

157
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,128
I've never sensed anything like it.

158
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:12,500
I believe these celebrity ghosts
are still roaming the world.

159
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:14,547
Reaching out, through the child.

160
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,273
They're lost in purgatory.

161
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,808
Purgatory?
What's that?

162
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,939
Sometimes when people die,

163
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,939
they can't accept
what's happen to them.

164
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,263
And so,
before they reach the after life,

165
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:31,419
they go to a place called

166
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,892
purgatory.

167
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,240
It is a temporary plane
of existence.

168
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,747
It's neither heaven nor hell.

169
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,010
Purgatory is like,

170
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:45,378
being on an airplane
that is waiting to take off.

171
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:48,337
But you're still sitting
at the gate.

172
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:52,463
And even though
the plane isn't taking off,

173
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,777
they won't let you
back off the plane.

174
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:59,213
And you can't get up
to go to the bathroom.

175
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,797
Because you're on an active runway.

176
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,536
All these dead celebrities

177
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,528
are sitting on that plane,

178
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:10,051
waiting and wanting to move on.

179
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,386
Bur for whatever reason,
they are stuck,

180
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,717
without any information,

181
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,602
even from the pilot.

182
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,369
How much longer it's going to be.

183
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,700
And it's taking forever.

184
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:25,234
They are not serving drinks yet.

185
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,284
It's like a terrifying limbo.

186
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:30,632
My God!

187
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,135
Poor Billy Mays!

188
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,084
I am speaking to the celebrities
that are haunting this child.

189
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:55,486
If any spirit can hear my voice,
make your presence known.

190
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:06,623
<i>Billy Mays here again
with another fantastic product.</i>

191
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,527
Billy Mays, it's him!

192
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,797
<i>Are you tired of having to put
your toilet seat down?</i>

193
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,505
Yes, I am, Billy Mays.

194
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:17,527
<i>Be quite, Billy Mays.
Somebody is trying to contact us.</i>

195
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:20,182
To which celebrity
am I addressing now?

196
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:21,997
<i>This is Walter Cronkite.</i>

197
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,585
All you celebrities need to know
that you have passed on.

198
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:28,554
<i>- We know that.
- Of course, we know that.</i>

199
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,027
<i>There's only one person here
not cooperating.</i>

200
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,454
<i>That's right.
Just admit you're dead and sit down.</i>

201
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,528
<i>That's ignorant.</i>

202
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,282
<i>I'm not dead.</i>

203
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:42,562
<i>You are dead!</i>

204
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,351
<i>I just have a skin condition.</i>

205
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:49,373
Boys quickly,
convince Michael Jackson he's dead.

206
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:50,961
- What?
- He's in denial.

207
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,819
He's been in denial all his life.

208
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:55,464
Tel him or you're going to lose
your little brother.

209
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,769
Mr. Jackson, you aren't alive.

210
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,553
You're in purgatory.

211
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:04,755
<i>You being ignorant.
I'm alive.</i>

212
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,942
<i>And I'm a child.</i>

213
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:08,757
<i>And I'm white.</i>

214
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:12,391
Mr. Jackson, please,
you're causing a lot of problems.

215
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:15,783
<i>Billy Mays here
for the Super Sweeper.</i>

216
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,194
Shut up, Billy Mays!

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,270
You're dead, Mr. Jackson.

218
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:22,157
<i>- That's just ignorant.
- Accept it!</i>

219
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,956
He's in too much denial.

220
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,962
Wake up, buddy.

221
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,217
You got to wake up!

222
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,138
There you go.
That's good!

223
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,019
I thought I lost you,
little brother.

224
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,393
That's ignorant.

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,330
Look, everyone.
I told you I was alive.

226
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,036
What are you doing
inside my little brother?

227
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm a child.
I knew I was a child, see?

228
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,901
Come on, let's play.
Let's go climb a tree.

229
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,210
Come back here!

230
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:09,282
Come on, let's climb the tree.

231
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,827
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this.
This is not your body.

232
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,208
I'm a little white child.
Let's play.

233
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:21,776
Asshole, you're keeping
a lot of celebrities in purgatory.

234
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,046
Including the late
and talented Billy Mays.

235
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,698
It's ignorant!

236
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:28,449
People lie
and spread rumors about me.

237
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:31,708
Like that I'm dead.
How could I do this if I was dead?

238
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,965
What are we going to do?

239
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,610
Come on, this is ridiculous.

240
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,168
How much longer
do we have to sit in purgatory?

241
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:51,079
- Come on!
- This is ridiculous!

242
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:53,998
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we thank you for your patience.</i>

243
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,889
<i>I've been informed we are delayed</i>

244
00:13:56,014 --> 00:13:58,253
<i>at least another 96 hours.</i>

245
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,049
You can't
keep people stuck like this.

246
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,910
<i>We know you want
to cross over to the next plane</i>

247
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,554
<i>but for now, you have to stay.</i>

248
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,764
That's it!
I have to go to the bathroom.

249
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,593
<i>Stay in your seat
with your seatbelt fasten.</i>

250
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:15,522
You've been saying that
for three months now.

251
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,446
Let's see.
Demonic ghosts, animal ghosts.

252
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,750
Setting traps for ghosts.

253
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,222
Here's the one part
that really makes no sense.

254
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,635
The first time you saw
blood stains on your underwear,

255
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,239
were you alarmed?

256
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,633
Was I alarmed?

257
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:39,457
- I believe I was.
- So why do you just ignore it

258
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,715
using something
as stupid as Chipotle away?

259
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:43,200
Chipotlaway.

260
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:45,661
I'm not the one who uses it.
My mom does.

261
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,301
She does the laundry.

262
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,034
Your mom uses Chipotlaway

263
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,906
to clean blood stains
out of your underwear?

264
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:57,615
And then takes you to Chipotle
and buys you more?

265
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,147
Yes. It's totally normal.

266
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,220
People do this stuff, you know.

267
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:03,716
Not every one can be the boy
with the golden butt hole.

268
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:06,083
Here it is.
"Possession by a ghost".

269
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,157
"A ghost that enters
and refuses to leave a living host

270
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:13,161
because it failed in the living world
to be what it wanted to be."

271
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,558
"The ghost must be allowed
to transform and be recognized

272
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,077
by the living
as what it always tried to be."

273
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,605
What did Michael Jackson
always try to be?

274
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,130
A child.
And a female.

275
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,112
- And white.
- Look, a planet.

276
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,805
He wants to finally be accepted
by the living as a little white girl.

277
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:34,545
What are we going to do?
Dress him up in a princess gown

278
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,227
and parade him like the parents
of those child pageants?

279
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,192
{\*LYNCHBURG WELCOMES
THE TINY MISS PAGEANT!}

280
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,362
First up, we have the beautiful
Miss Jessica.

281
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,298
All right, Jessica.

282
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,005
Jessica enjoys
riding her horse Marley

283
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,247
and doing her nails
with her sisters.

284
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,499
Next, contestant number 26,
Miss Brandy.

285
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:03,204
Brandy, work it, girl.

286
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:07,173
Brandy likes ice cream
and playing with her cat, Sunshine.

287
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,093
Don't forget to blow a kiss
to the judges, Brandy.

288
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,380
And now welcome
contestant number 27,

289
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,604
little Miss Michael Jackson.

290
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,400
- All right, Michael!
- Work it!

291
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,346
Michael says
she just enjoys being a child.

292
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,826
She loves to play and climb trees

293
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,333
and thinks people who don't
are ignorant.

294
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,688
Ignorant.

295
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,601
God, I hope this works.

296
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,820
Billy Mays here
for the little Country Handy Pillow.

297
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,048
Are you tired of sitting in limbo?

298
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:47,621
Lost somewhere
between planes of existence?

299
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,174
Now there is a product...

300
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,481
Will somebody
shut his fucking mouth?

301
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:52,969
I can't take it anymore.

302
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,551
It's bad enough
without having to listen to you

303
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,474
try and sell your stupid crap.

304
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,582
With two easy steps,
I can climb over these seats

305
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,896
and kick you in the fucking balls.

306
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:06,190
That does it
We won't just sit here anymore.

307
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,609
We want answers.

308
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,362
Why isn't anybody
telling us anything?

309
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:13,665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

310
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,494
It's about fucking time.

311
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:18,977
<i>Certainly want to thank you
for all your patience.</i>

312
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,222
<i>We know that you're eager to...</i>

313
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,347
<i>get going and we will certainly pass
on any information...</i>

314
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,384
<i>as it becomes...</i>

315
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,229
<i>more available.</i>

316
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:31,920
Michael Jackson isn't here anymore.
He's gone.

317
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:33,510
We should move on now.

318
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,515
<i>But as we all know,
Mr. Jackson had a lot of baggage.</i>

319
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,868
<i>He checked some of that baggage in.
So the crew has to go through it</i>

320
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,062
<i>and get his out of purgatory
before we push back from the gate.</i>

321
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,786
Did I do good
in the swimsuit category?

322
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,198
I was worried that brunette
was prettier than me.

323
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:00,215
Excuse me. Please do us a favor
and vote for little Miss Jackson.

324
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,370
It's important.

325
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:03,842
It's more important
for my little Kylie.

326
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,966
Just look at this face.

327
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,837
Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants.

328
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,898
All right.
Thank you, Miss Cassie.

329
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,278
Now for her talent portion,

330
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,392
Miss Michael Jackson
is going to sing for us.

331
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,692
<i>I'm just a little girl</i>

332
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,118
<i>A dainty little thing</i>

333
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,329
<i>And I know you all want to be</i>

334
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,439
<i>A little white girl like me</i>

335
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,464
The two male judges love her.

336
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,236
All right.
That's about enough.

337
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,758
- Crap.
- What the eff?

338
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,801
All right, everyone.

339
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,554
The judge will now tally
her final scores.

340
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:03,209
We're totally screwed.
They took the two best judges away.

341
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,163
No way that lady judge
is voting for us.

342
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:06,902
She's glaring the entire time.

343
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:10,177
You'll win for sure, Heidi.
That judge adores you.

344
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,515
This is hopeless.

345
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:16,404
Wait.
Look at the lady judge.

346
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,532
She's eating Chipotle.

347
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,787
- So what?
- Maybe she doesn't know.

348
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,817
Maybe she doesn't know!

349
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,584
Excuse me, ma'am.
I see you're eating Chipotle.

350
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:34,478
It's my favorite fast food,
I would eat it every day.

351
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:35,631
Except I...

352
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:37,613
Except...

353
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,677
You can't afford
buying all the underwear?

354
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:42,414
How did you know?

355
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,981
It doesn't matter.
I'm just going to have to give it up.

356
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,758
What if you didn't have
to give it up?

357
00:19:54,003 --> 00:19:55,046
Excuse me?

358
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,384
I think you and I might be able
to help each other here.

359
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:07,963
And now it is time to announce
our grand little miss.

360
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:10,291
Little Miss Michael Jackson!

361
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,636
I'm sorry I didn't win, mommy.

362
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,956
Thank you so much for this reward.

363
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,840
Of all the awards I ever won,
this one means the most.

364
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:30,707
I feel like...

365
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,271
I'm finally at rest.

366
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,621
I'm finally at rest!

367
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,401
I'm free!

368
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:43,914
Holy shit!

369
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,850
What the fuck am I wearing?

370
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:50,969
Ike, you're back.

371
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,201
What the fuck is going on?

372
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:55,626
It's okay, Ike.

373
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,594
You're going to be okay.

374
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,974
Thanks to us and Chipotlaway,
the celebrities can now rest.

375
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:07,890
I'm free!

376
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,351
I'm free!

377
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,021
He's here!

378
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,299
- Finally!
- He's here!

379
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,902
<i>All right, everyone.
Looks like we're all ready to move on.</i>

380
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,821
Did you all see my crown?

381
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,057
Finally, we can all move on!

382
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,072
<i>All right. I'd like to be the first
to welcome you to the gates of hell.</i>

383
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:38,922
<i>Unfortunately,
hell is a towing gate.</i>

384
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,456
