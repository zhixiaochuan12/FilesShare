If they come near you,you  can touch their backs.

Just no grabbing,please.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,040
What whimsical creatures,aren't they?

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,230
All the dolphins you will be  encountering today are atlantic  bottlenose dolphins.

25
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,490
Now who'd like to get a kiss  from one?

I wanna kiss it!

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,450
Uh,alright.Let's just get you to put your  hands,

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,550
palms down on the water.

31
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,450
What the hell is that?

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,890
Oh no!It's the japanese!

33
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,090
*****You dolphin!

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,220
*****You dolphin!

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,480
These are our favorite  animals here at the atlanta zoo.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,860
It's dolly and seamore.

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,430
They are beluga whales.

38
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,400
These whales live mostly in the  arctic region.

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,590
Alright,jessica.

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,260
Now put your arms out like this.

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,420
Great job,jessica!

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,220
****You wha-ruuuuu!

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,790
Hey pal.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,880
Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the japanese.

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,640
Dad,why did they do that?

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,090
Well stan,the japanese just

47
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,510
don't really like dolphins very much.

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,350
Certainly not as much as us normal people do.

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,080
But hey,at least you still got  your t-shirt!

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,240
And you'll always have your  neat picture!

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,160
my new friend!

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,560
Dan dierdorf here welcoming you to this great football matchup

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,940
between the kansas city chiefs and the miami dolphins.

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,670
We're all set for kick-off and

55
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,580
Uh dan,it looks like some japanese people are now rushing  onto the field.

56
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,080
This is not the kind of thing you want happening during  kickoff.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
****You dolphin!

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,500
Several whales and dolphins  were again slaughtered by the  japanese today.

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,000
This time at the six flags  discovery kingdom near san  francisco.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,340
Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the  japanese out,

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,950
but so far nothing seems to stop them.

62
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,400
When asked if all of japan  supported the slaughtering of  whales and dolphins,

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,440
the current prime minister of japan,yukio  hatoyama had this to say.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,300
You way-ruuuu!

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,920
And  You dolphin!

66
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,790
Can't read my,can't read  my

67
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,510
no,he can't read my poker face

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,870
she's got to love nobody

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,800
can't read my,can't ready my

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,510
no,he can't read my poker face

71
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,890
she's got to love nobody

72
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,350
p-p-p-poker face

73
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,970
p-p-p-poker face

74
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,400
p-p-p-poker face

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,010
- You guys,you guys!
- p-p-p-poker face

76
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,200
Look,I really think it's time for us to do something.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
This is all getting way out of  hand.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
What do you mean? This song is sweet.

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,860
No,not the song.I'm talking about the japanese  killing whales and dolphins.

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,540
Dude,they've been doing that for a long time.

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,550
So?Dude,don't you guys care?

82
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,850
We have to do something!

83
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,890
What are we going to do,stan?

84
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,540
It's not like we can change the  way an entire country thinks.

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,420
I don't like it,but it's just  the way they are.

86
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,000
It seems like everyone has an attitude of

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,110
'that's just the way they are' and 'that's just the  way it is.

88
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,060
'Nobody likes it but everyone's  too busy to do anything about  it.

89
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,850
- I'm not too busy stan.
- You're not?

90
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,750
- No.I just don't care at all.
- Yeah,me neither.

91
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,480
Kenny?You don't care about whales and  dolphins being slaughtered?!

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,200
Stan,me and kenny don't give two shits about stupid ass  Whales.

93
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,980
You know,when all the whales and dolphins in the world are  gone

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,880
people are going to wish that at some point they had  taken the time to care

95
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,330
just a  little god dammit!

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,150
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be

97
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,310
I don't give a crap bout  whales so go and hug a tree

98
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,080
Hey,stan!

99
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,950
I heard you're looking for  people who care about the  japanese slaughtering whales!

100
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,780
Yeah!Butters,you wanna help?!

101
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,560
No,no,no,no.I got stuff to do.

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,350
But I wanted to tell you,there's these fellers on tv.

103
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,360
They go out in the ocean and try to stop the japanese wherever  they are!

104
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,610
Really?People who are doing something?!

105
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,150
I watch their show all the  time.

106
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,850
And they take volunteers!

107
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,010
Then that's where I belong.

108
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,410
The world is a vampire

109
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah,we are bad ass.

110
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,020
Any means necessary.

111
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,010
We're not protesters.

112
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,000
We're pirates.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
WHALE WARS

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
That's definitely a japanese  boat!

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,980
Looks like they're whaling now!

116
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,880
****You whale!

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh my god,they're gonna kill those humpbacks!

118
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,960
We gotta do something!

119
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,030
Pull up next to them!

120
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,290
The fight is on!

121
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,920
Sweet!

122
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,010
- Are we ready to do this?
- Yeah!

123
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,310
Yeah!Hell yeah!Let's do it!

124
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,450
Are we bad asses?!

125
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,560
Yeah!

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,140
Are we bad asses?

127
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,290
Yeah!

128
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,320
Alright.So.

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,980
what do we do?

130
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,730
Wait.I know!

131
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,610
How about we go on their ship  and then beat ourselves up!

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,790
And then we can tell the media  they did it!

133
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,320
Great idea,captain!

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,700
I'll start right now!

135
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,920
Oh my god.Luke's been hurt trying to save  whales!

136
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,200
Wait,wait,wait!I've got a better idea!

137
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,450
How about I pretend to be shot!

138
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,600
Then we can tell the media the  japanese shot me

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,810
and it'll start a international crisis!

140
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,400
Wul,wait.We don't wanna just lie about  stuff.

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,590
Why not?

142
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,870
Because then we're just  douche bags,dude.C'mon,they're right here.

143
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,250
Let's get hardcore!

144
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,770
You know what?He's right!

145
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,700
It's time to bring out the big  guns.

146
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,580
You guys ready?Ready?

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,350
And.throw the stinky butter  at them!

148
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,100
you stink now.

149
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,020
- Wait that's it?
- Yeah,we make'em stink!

150
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,120
Ha-ha,your boat is stinky!

151
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,290
Here,throw one!

152
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,240
Those guys always covered in  dolphin and whale guts!

153
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,580
They don't care if they stink!

154
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,190
C'mon lets break their boat!

155
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,550
Wul,no,that'd be illegal.

156
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,010
Yeah.

157
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,160
I thought you guys were  pirates in a war!

158
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,310
I'm a pirate in a war!

159
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,920
Pirates don't worry about the law.

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,490
You guys said you were bad ass!

161
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,370
We are!People think our methods are  extreme,

162
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,140
but we'll keep making  their boat stink as long as they are killing whales and dolphins!

163
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,690
The japanese are scared of  how hardcore we are!

164
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,340
Paul!

165
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,990
- Paul?
- What do we do?

166
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,670
- We don't have a captain!
- Oh,my god!Oh,my god!

167
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,540
Maybe he's okay.

168
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,990
UTILITY

169
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,010
Oh my god!

170
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,360
What did you do?

171
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,090
What you Acted like  you were doing.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
WHALE WARS GETS BETTER

173
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,870
Things Actually Happen Now!

174
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,870
I want to hold them like they do in texas play

175
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,900
a little gamble and it's fun  when you're with me********

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,760
russian roulette is not the  same without a gun

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,090

178
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,590

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,500

Wait for it.

185
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,740
wait for it.

186
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,800

188
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
LITTLE BOY SINKS ANOTHER JAPANESE BOAT!

189
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,310
Inpo no gaijin!

190
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,020
Kuso 0 taberu na!

191
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,930
And now larry king,live!

192
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,440
My guest tonight is the  little boy who took over the  whale wars reality show

193
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,290
and turned it into a big hit.

194
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,870
Please welcome,stan marsh and  his crew.

195
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,390
Hey jordon!I'm on larry king,mate!

196
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,720
So stan,what motivated you,

197
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,170
what inspired you to get out  there and  make a hit tv show?

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,110
No,I -I don't really care  about the tv show.

199
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,630
I'm just trying to stop the  japanese from killing dolphins  and whales.

200
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,770
Once you became captain the  methods used

201
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,000
to stop the  japanese definitely became more  aggressive.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Was that the key to helping  boost your ratings?

203
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,270
No,I don't care about the  show.

204
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,700
We're pirates!

205
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,810
I just want people to know  that you can stop the japanese

206
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,870
if you have some real   Balls.

207
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,770
I've got balls!

208
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,010
Well,there are many people  who see what you're doing as a  positive thing,

209
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,890
and of course  many that see problems with it.

210
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,680
Joining us now is one of those  people,

211
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,340
and you say stan's  methods are unethical.

212
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,180
Larry,you can't just go out  and take matters into your own  hands like this.

213
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,040
If you want a hit tv show you  have to go through producers,directors,

214
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,770
people that are in  the unions.

215
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,380
But sid,you saw the show  before stan took it over.

216
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,810
You have to admit that it was  nothing

217
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,760
but incompetent vegan   Doing absolutely nothing

218
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,260
and trying to turn it into  drama.

219
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,920
Yes,but it doesn't justify

220
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,460
changing the entire show  structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.

221
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,110
Could we just talk about the  actual whaling problem for a  second?

222
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,900
But their old captain,paul  watson,was an unorganized,

223
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,700
incompetent media whore who  thought lying to everyone was  okay

224
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,740
as long as it served his  cause.

225
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,420
Yes,of course everyone knows that paul watson was a smug,

226
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,450
- narcololeptic liar with no  credibility but
-  Screw this.

227
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,390
I gotta get back to work.

228
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,860
On this episode of real  actual whale wars.

229
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,520
captain marsh searches for the  japanese fleet,

230
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,360
knowing they  could be absolutely anywhere.

231
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,340
Would you mind stepping back  a little?

232
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,910
Captain!Captain,some new volunteers  showed up to help us in our  crusade.

233
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,270
No,dude,we really can't  take any more volunteers.

234
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,470
But they say you know them.

235
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,790
Alright,dude.This is pretty sweet.

236
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,320
- Oh,no.No,no!
- What,dude?

237
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,010
Oh what,so now that I have a hit tv show you guys care about  dolphins and whales?

238
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,070
We always have.

239
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,200
Yeah,totally!

240
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,300
I asked you guys to help me  and you said no.

241
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,860
That's not what we said.

242
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,750
You said 'stan,me and kenny  don't give two -about stupid  ass whales'.

243
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,050
We were talking about wales  the country.

244
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,290
Look,if you admit that you  are only doing this because you  want to be on tv,

245
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,170
then I'll  consider it.

246
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,770
Admit you just want to be on  tv.

247
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,960
I just want to be on tv.

248
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,550
Kenny,

249
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,740
I deserve to be on tv.

250
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,190
Captain!

251
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,240
Captain the japanese have  been spotted near buoy 24!

252
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,070
Takes us out of port!All hands to stations.

253
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,830
Alright.Let's go save those whales,you  guys!

254
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,400
Captain marsh races his boat  to the last known location of  the japanese whalers.

255
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,270
If he doesn't get there in time,hundreds of dolphins or whales  could die.

256
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,850
As soon as we get there we  gotta be ready to deploy the  tracking devices!

257
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,960
We can't let those whales get  hurt!

258
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,849
What the hell is that?

259
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,230
We just got rammed.

260
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,920
The japanese want to play  that way,huh?

261
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,100
It's not the japanese.

262
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,460
What?

263
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,980
On deck,the crew is  surprised at what they saw.

264
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,000
The other boat is from deadliest catch.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,070
A crab fishing reality show.

266
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,620
You think you're so cool,don't you?

267
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,860
You think you're a big boat  reality show on the block?

268
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,580
Take it away men's livelihoods.

269
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,560
what?We're trying to save whales.

270
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,580
***************

271
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,560
You're show is gay,maN.

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
Your show is  Gay.

273
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,620
Screw this.Turn to port.

274
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,960
But everywhere his reality  show boat turns,

275
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,300
the crab  fishing reality show blockses  its path.

276
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,080
Dude,You.

277
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,930
You.

278
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,260
It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't  budging.

279
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,530
Captain marsh's boat is dead in  the water.

280
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:13,160
Can't go after the japanese,can't help the whales or  dolphins.

281
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,830
Once again on whale wars,nothing is happening.

282
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,890
It's pretty typical time  because we know that

283
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,940
every  minute we're sitting here  stopped,another whale is dying.

284
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,480
Really tough.It's really hard.

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,820
It's like we've dedicated all  our times and our lives to  saving these creatures.

286
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,850
*******

287
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,710
Oh,he's taking it especially hard.

288
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,700
He loved dolphins so much,********

289
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,880
he *********** would do anything.

290
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:46,881
Anything, anything

291
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,970
Crab fishing reality show is doing fine.

292
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,330
But for the whale wars crew,it appears the show is over.

293
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,190
Until a sound is heard.

294
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,290
What was that?

295
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,750
Captain,look!

296
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,520
The whales are taking out the crab fishermen reality show.

297
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,060
It's like they know.

298
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,960
They do know.

299
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,250
They know everything I've been  trying to do for them.

300
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,870
Our********* friends of the sea have  saved the day.

301
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,140
Because they know that only we  can save them from the japanese.

302
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,810
Bonsai!

303
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,470
Jesus christ!

304
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,010
We got to get somebody to  shoot them with.

305
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,470
Look out!

306
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,370
I I can't believe it.

307
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,380
Dude,you know what?

308
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,530
Japanese people really do not  like whales.

309
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,490
Well,I'm in japanese prison  lord.

310
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,330
Japanese prison got me down.

311
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,050
Said I'm in japanese prison  lawwwd,

312
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,290
don't belong here.My eyes are round.

313
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,980
Will you stop that?

314
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,820
Oh,I'm sorry.Am I making things uncomfortable for you,stan?

315
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,690
It's your fault me and kenny are in the mess!

316
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,650
Things are bad enough without you being a smart ass!

317
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,250
There's whales out there being  slaughtered right now

318
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,320
and I  can't do anything about it!So just keep quiet.

319
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,120
You don't have a tv show  anymore,captain,

320
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,180
so you can  suck my japanese imprisoned  balls.

321
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm in a japanese prison lawd,

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,070
japanese balls got me

323
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,270
Kite kure!Akihito sama irashaimasu!

324
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:55,140
So you are the ones who has  been a sinking our boats!

325
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,400
You speak english.

326
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,850
You have caused us many  problems!

327
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,920
Set us back many months!

328
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,650
Sir,we actually don't give  two -about you killing whales.Can we go?

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,740
Yeah,can we go?

330
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,120
Why have you done this?

331
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,550
Why do you insist on making  trouble for the japanese?

332
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,980
Why do you do what you do?

333
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,150
You know that 98% of the world  is against whaling?

334
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,060
Why can't you just stop?

335
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,880
You think you have the right  to tell us what is ok?

336
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,020
I have something to show you.

337
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,210
This is hiroshima.

338
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,700
Over 50 years ago,this entire  city was destroyed by nuclear  bomb.

339
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,520
We built this museum so that we  never forget what happened.

340
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,210
What?Dude.

341
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,450
At 8:15 am,the people of  hiroshima were just minding  their own business,

342
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,330
when out of  nowhere,a flash devastated them all.

343
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,000
Women,children,who died in the flash simply evaporated.

344
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,290
Those left alive,suffered the  worst pain of all.

345
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,950
Burns,radiation poisoning.

346
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,470
For generations the radiation  affected the victims.

347
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,000
Japanese babies born without  limbs.

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,270
Without eyes!

349
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,010
Sorry.

350
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,840
Little gassy.'Scuse me.

351
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,430
140,000 japanese were kill by atom bomb.

352
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,240
We have never recovered from the memory of that day.

353
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,900
It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible.

354
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,750
This picture shows the plane  that dropped the bomb.

355
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,510
It was called the enola gay.

356
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,000
And it was flown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day.

357
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,250
Dolphin!

358
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,240
And whale!

359
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,400
where did you get  that picture.

360
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,940
The americans were nice  enough to give it to us the day  after the bombing.

361
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,030
We were so thankful for the  picture,

362
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,310
that the next day we  ended our war with america.

363
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,250
We will never forgive.

364
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,310
Never rest until they are all  wiped out.

365
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,650
****You.

366
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,380
****You dolphin and whale!

367
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,150
So that's what this has all  been about.

368
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,150
Dude,it actually wasn't a  dolphin and a whale who bombed  hiroshima,

369
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,530
it was the

370
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,910
Dude,they won't rest until  whoever is responsible is  completely wiped out.

371
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,600
Right.

372
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,960
Look,I -I think I can make everything ok here.

373
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,820
Can I just use a phone?

374
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,500
- Hello.
- Stan?

375
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,780
Dude,are you sitting at your computer?

376
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,070
I need you to do something for  me.

377
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,890
Mr.Prime minister,japanese  officials.

378
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,400
there's something you need to  know.

379
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,800
The photo you were given of the  enola gay was doctored.

380
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,340
Because the real bombers feared  retaliation so badly that

381
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,790
they  simply pointed the finger at  somebody else.

382
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,130
My government has authorized me  to give you the original photo,unaltered,

383
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,880
so you can finally  know the truth.

384
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,180
Dolphins and whales were just  framed by the real bombers.

385
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,360
A chicken and a cow.

386
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,170
Chicken and a cow?

387
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,680
Chicken and a cow?

388
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,920
Chicken and cow used poor  dolphin and whale as scapegoat?

389
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,060
This is outrage!

390
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,370
****You,cow!

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,620
****You chicken!
