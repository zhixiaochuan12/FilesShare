1
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,005
Ok children, let's
take our seats.

2
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,849
This morning we're going to
have a special lecture

3
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,850
from your school
counselor, Mr. Mackee.

4
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,119
Now, now, who was that? That is
not appropriate behavior, mmkay?

5
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,239
I'm sorry Mr. Mackee, mmkay?

6
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:35,194
- Uh, that's ok, just don't
let it happen again.

7
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:38,495
We won't let it happen
again Mr. Mackee, mmkay?

8
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,838
- Ok, ok, that's fine.
- Mmkay?

9
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,686
Ok.

10
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:47,669
No, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to
tell you about drugs and alcohol

11
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,270
and why they're bad, mmkay?

12
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:53,481
So, first of all, uh, smoking's bad.
You shouldn't smoke.

13
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:57,078
And, uh, alcohol is bad.
You shouldn't drink alcohol.

14
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,486
And, uh, as for drugs, well, drugs
are bad. You shouldn't do drugs.

15
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:04,645
Ok, that about wraps up my introduction.
Now, uh, are there any questions?

16
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:08,121
- Yes, Stan.
- Why do dogs have cold noses?

17
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:10,318
Uh, well, I'm not sure.

18
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:14,843
No, uh, let's focus our discussion
first on mari-ja-uana.

19
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:19,439
Mari-ja-uana's bad. And it also
has a very distinct smell, mmkay?

20
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,883
I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny
bit, and I want you all to take a smell

21
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,984
so you know when someone is
smoking mari-ja-uana near you.

22
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:31,763
Mmkay, take a smell, pass it on, and when it
gets back up to me, we'll finish talking about it.

23
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:36,723
In the meantime, I want to get into
alcohol a little, mmkay? Alcohol is bad, kay?

24
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,649
- If you drink alcohol you should uh....
- Hey, are you guys

25
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,950
gonna come to Ike's
party this weekend?

26
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:44,484
- Your little brother's having a party?
Why, is it his birthday? - No, it's his Bris.

27
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,078
-What the hell is a Bris? - I don't know, but
there's going to be lots of food, and a band.

28
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:52,804
- Oh, kick ass, I want to have a Bris.
- And so, uh, that's why alcohol is bad.

29
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,567
Uh, has, has that mari-ja-uana
made it back up here yet?

30
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:57,807
No, oh, oh, okay.

31
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:02,524
Let's talk about LSD.
Uh, children, LSD is, is bad.

32
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:05,958
It's a drug made famous by
John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

33
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:09,478
- Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother
presents for a Bris? - Uh, I'm not sure.

34
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:12,247
- Dude, you better find out.
- Boys, are you paying attention?

35
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:14,494
- Sorry Mr. Mackee, mmkay?

36
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:18,495
- Mmkay. Now children, has that
mari-ja-uana made it around yet?

37
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:23,077
Uh, who, who has the
mari-ja-uana now?

38
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:30,002
Oh, oh, okay, whoev, whoever has the marijauana,
just pass it up to the front row, mmkay?

39
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:36,480
I am very disappointed in you young man.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

40
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:40,886
- What could have possessed you to be
so stupid? - I'm sorry Principal Victoria.

41
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:43,877
Wehell, sorry isn't going to cut
the cheese this time mister.

42
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to suspend you from school.

43
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:49,882
- You mean I'm fired? - Well I guess
that's the grown up way to put it, yes.

44
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:53,261
But, but it was an honest
error of judgement, mmkay?

45
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:56,562
I, I really thought it was important for the
kids to know the smell of marihuana, mmkay?

46
00:04:56,688 --> 00:05:00,397
It was an error of judgement Mr. Mackee,
but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it.

47
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:02,883
We searched each one of
those kids, but came up empty.

48
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:04,346
We had to let them go home,

49
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,947
and one of them now has have a
lid of Jamaican grass because of you!

50
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:12,208
How, how am I going to make ends meet,
mmkay? What, what will I do for money?

51
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,284
There, there now. Maybe this
will all blow over someday

52
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:18,985
and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning
up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.

53
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:21,884
Mmkay.

54
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:28,957
- Man, that sucked getting searched.
- Yeh, my ass is killing me.

55
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:33,320
- Why did they search us? That marihuana never
even made it to us. - I wonder who took it.

56
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:38,760
And now it's almost time for Bo-bo's.

57
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,361
- Hello there children.
- Hey, Chef. How's it goin'?

58
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,163
- Bad.  - Why bad? - Children, I heard
about what happened at school today.

59
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:53,247
- Now none of you took that nasty marijuana
did you? - No dude! We never even saw it.

60
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:57,600
Ok, because I just want to
tell you that drugs are bad.

61
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:02,165
- We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
- Right, but do you know why they're bad?

62
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:05,000
Because they're an addictive solution to
a greater problem causing disease of both

63
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:07,401
body and mind with consequences far
outweighing their supposed benefits.

64
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,127
And do you have any
idea what that means?

65
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:15,487
- No. - I know, drugs are bad because if you
do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.

66
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,476
- Look children, this is all I'm
going to say about drugs:

67
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:22,840
Stay away from them, there's a
time and a place for everything,

68
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:27,086
- and it's called college.
Do you understand? - Sure.

69
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,887
- Ok. - Hey, are you going to
come to Ike's Bris this weekend?

70
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,647
Oh hell no, I can't
bear to see that.

71
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:37,478
- What do you mean? - Don't you boys know
what a Bris is? They're going to circumcise him.

72
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,520
- What's that?
- Oh boy, here we go again.

73
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:47,198
Children, uh, what's the one thing that's more
sacred to a man than anything else in the world?

74
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,687
- Uh, bicycles?
- Ham?

75
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,800
- No, not ham you fat fuck!
- Screw you! It's ham isn't it?

76
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:57,160
No, no, no children, I'm talking about the
most important part of a man's body.

77
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,767
- Your heart?
- Your eyes?

78
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,427
Oh, your penis.

79
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,364
That's right.

80
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:05,148
Hey, my mom says you're not
supposed to call it a penis Kenny.

81
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,749
You're supposed to call it a fireman.

82
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:09,925
- A fireman? - That's the proper way
to say it, or else you get a spanking.

83
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:13,953
Damn it children. Why do I always have to
be the one to explain all this stuff to you?

84
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:15,354
Ask your parents for once.

85
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,040
Hey, wait!

86
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,602
Dude, something tells me
this Bris thing isn't good.

87
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:25,365
Hey Mackee, you got any more pot?
My four year old needs a fix.

88
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:31,119
Hey Mackee, now we see what you and
Homer Simpson have in common. Dope!!

89
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:35,967
Hey Mackee, who do you think you are
you stupid drug taking hippie?!?

90
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:38,526
- Hey, you stoned man?
- You wanna do some drugs?

91
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,032
Hell, I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

92
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:49,733
No, I, I just, I had to get away,
mmkay? I just lost my job.

93
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:54,000
Ah, that's weak man. You know what
you need? You need a good, stiff drink.

94
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:58,440
- Oh, uh, I, I don't drink, mmkay?
- Trust me man, it'll make you feel better.

95
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,246
Uh, drinking's bad.

96
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:05,442
Go ahead, drink the beer.
It'll calm you down.

97
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:10,563
Yeh, why the hell not? It's just a
beer. Don't be such a pussy, mmkay?

98
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,559
- So, how do you feel?
- Oh, about the same.

99
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,997
Ah, you just need
something a little stronger.

100
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,278
- Kyle, you have to stop them!
- Stop who?

101
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:27,003
- Dude, I found out what a Bris is. I found out
what they're going to do to Ike. - What?

102
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:29,961
They're going to chop
off his wee-wee!

103
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:34,806
- Chop off his wee-wee! Are you sure?
- Yeh dude! It's a Jewish tradition.

104
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:36,607
It's called a circumsticion.

105
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:40,355
- Dude, that is not cool!
Chopping off wee-wees is not cool!

106
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:42,456
That can't be true!
My parents wouldn't do that!

107
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,868
Dude, I asked five
different people.

108
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:45,562
They said all Jewish boys
have circumsticions,

109
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,763
and the, and they make
it into a party called a Bris.

110
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:50,726
You don't just chop off
somebody's fireman!?

111
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,726
I won't believe it! I won't!
I have to ask my mom and dad!

112
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:57,727
We are young, mmkay?

113
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:01,728
Heartache to heartache...
we stand, mmkay?

114
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:05,729
No promises, no demands,
mands, mands, mkay?

115
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:11,759
- Uh, is this my house? - Your key ain't
gonna work Mackee. I changed the locks.

116
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:14,960
- Why Mr. Freely?
- I'm not rentin' to you anymore.

117
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,398
I heard that you got fired from your
job for selling drugs to children.

118
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:21,964
No, no, no, mmkay?
It, it wasn't like that.

119
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,035
Drugs are an illegal narcotic!

120
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:27,736
And having never taken drugs, I can
say that they have nothing to offer.

121
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:33,400
- But I've never taken drugs either. - I've never
taken drugs and look at me. I'm totally fine.

122
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:36,565
Now get off my property
before I lose control and kill you.

123
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:42,408
Drug user! Drug user!

124
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,509
Come back here...

125
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,117
- Just a little higher.
- Mom, dad!

126
00:09:48,248 --> 00:09:52,400
Oh, hi boobala, I'm glad you're here.
You can help us decorate for the party?

127
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,998
- Your mother's made gahagafaka.
- What the hell is gafagafaka?

128
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,483
Mom, dad, what exactly
is this party for?

129
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,081
To celebrate your little
brother's passage into life.

130
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,597
- Meaning what?
- Meaning we're going to circumcise him.

131
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:10,003
- They are going to cut off his fireman!
- It's Jewish tradition, Booby.

132
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,340
Normally we do it right
after the baby is born

133
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,341
but we had to do it later
for Ike because he's a...

134
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:22,559
Oh, now what's gotten into him?!?
Stan, will you go talk to him?

135
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:26,838
Let us cut off your pee-pee, Stan!!

136
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,917
Oy, what is the matter with them?

137
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,801
- I can't believe my parents are cannibals.
- What are you going to do, dude?

138
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,110
I have to save my little brother.

139
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:39,211
I have to send him away until
my parents come to their senses.

140
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:41,080
- Come on, Ike.
- Hidee how.

141
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,465
- Cover me for a while. I'll find a
place to hide him and come back.

142
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,766
- No way dude! We're not staying alone in your
house with your wee-wee chopping parents!

143
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,780
Just give me thirty minutes.
Come on Ike.

144
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,162
Oh, I can't sleep,
it's too cold, mmkay?

145
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:58,884
- Hey, you want something to warm you up?
- Oh, uh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.

146
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,822
Here, try this. It'll warm you up.

147
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,924
- Uh, ehehe, mari-ja-uana's bad.
- What?

148
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:07,326
- Uh, mar-mari-ja-uana makes you
feel depressed and low, mmkay?

149
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,427
- And you don't feel
that way now?

150
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,519
Uh, good point.

151
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:18,037
Nah, I don't feel any differ...

152
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,200
Oooh, ooh baby,
get down, mmkay?

153
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:27,460
- Man, this alley is cool. It's so
love and beautiful. - Oh boy.

154
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,887
- Come on Ike, hurry up.
- A total nurra.

155
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:35,523
- Where's the next train going? - Lincoln,
Nebraska. Train leaves in five minutes.

156
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,684
- You want to go to Nebraska, Ike?
- Noo.

157
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:40,547
- I need one ticket for my little brother.
- That's a little brother?

158
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:41,767
I thought it was a trash
can or something.

159
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,679
What's wrong with his head?

160
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:47,357
I'm sorry but we just can't throw
Caucasian babies on an outbound train.

161
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,270
- But my parents are going
to cut off his ding-dong.

162
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,971
- What? Why the hell
would they do that?!?

163
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,317
They've just gone
crazy for a while.

164
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,718
Please mister, I have to hide my brother
until they come to their senses.

165
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,442
- No can do, sonny.
- Damn it!

166
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,439
Ike, if you want to keep your penis,
you have to get on this train.

167
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:08,525
- Ready Ike, kick the baby!
- Don't kick the baby.

168
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:13,526
Bye Ike, be safe. I'll come find you in Nebraska
when mom and dad are back to normal.

169
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:14,527
Bye bye.

170
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,358
Oh man, where am I, uh?

171
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,197
Hey wow, it's that counselor from
the elementary school, Mr. Mackee.

172
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,047
- Wow dude.
- Oh, hi boys, how are you today?

173
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,647
Pretty good man, how are you?

174
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:31,204
Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked
out of town for doing drugs.

175
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:34,291
- Hey, us too. - Yeh, remember you
caught us smoking weed

176
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:36,492
in the bathroom and
got us suspended.

177
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:39,361
Oh. O fortune, how you mock me.

178
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:42,719
Ah, cheer up bro, all you need is some
clear liquid to get your head straight.

179
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,567
Uh, boys, L-LSD is bad. Mmmm.

180
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,720
Uh, who, who put all this
cotton in my mouth?

181
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:57,444
Yeh, baby. The
world is so small.

182
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:03,036
I'm free, I'm free.

183
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:06,126
- Sweet dude, totally killer.
- That guy's totally tripping.

184
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,722
- There, what do you think?
- What the hell is that supposed to be?

185
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,096
I'm making a dummy Ike doll.

186
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,697
My parents think he's out with me right now,
and I have to bring him back for dinner.

187
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,643
Dude, I think your mom's
gonna notice that isn't Ike.

188
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:19,900
Not if I say he's sick and
put him to bed right away.

189
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,240
- No, go away, bad dog. - Dude,
what did you make that doll out of?

190
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,963
- I used a bunch of bones from the butcher
shop. - Is that why it stinks so bad?

191
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,558
- Hi boys.
- Hi Mr. Mackee.

192
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:35,158
- Are you boys stayin' out
of trouble? - Yes.

193
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:39,042
Ok, I, I'm just gonna go
over here for a while.

194
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:43,163
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so
that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.

195
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,598
- Knock it off asshole. - No way! I'm
never going back to your parents house.

196
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:50,164
Come on dude, if it were your
little brother we'd help you.

197
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,167
Ehh. Wait a minute!
No you wouldn't!

198
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:03,599
Would you look at that honey, somebody
dropped off a perfectly good trashcan.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeh, nooiwawagoche.

200
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:11,045
Booby, where have you been? Dinner's
been ready for five minutes.

201
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:14,001
Sorry mom, I just had to deal
with Ike. He, he's been cranky.

202
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,364
How is my little jelly bean?

203
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:17,365
Babaseemee mama.

204
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,507
I, I'm gonna take him up to
the bathroom to get washed up.

205
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:22,668
Ok, but first let mommy
give you a kiss.

206
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,320
Uh, no mom, he, he doesn't
want you kissing him.

207
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:29,002
- Oh my God, make it stop!
- Put it down you stupid dog!

208
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:33,521
- My baby! Oh God!!!! - Get out
of here you mutt! Let him go!

209
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:49,608
Oh he's dead, he's dead,
my little Boobala's dead.

210
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:52,561
There there Sheila,
there's nothing we can do.

211
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,939
Yea, usher us unto the Lord
sayeth some Jewish guy once.

212
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,640
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

213
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:13,039
Hey, wait a minute, how come Ike's
tombstone have a Canadian flag on it?

214
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,682
Well booby, there's
something you have to know.

215
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:18,276
Ike wasn't really your
brother, he was adopted.

216
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:21,844
- What?!? - He was not
really a Broflovski, he was Canadian,

217
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,528
but we loved him all the same.

218
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:25,961
You mean to tell me
that all this time

219
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,101
I've been trying to protect Ike
from having his fireman cut off

220
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:29,502
and he's not even
my real brother?

221
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:31,206
What are you talking about?

222
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,320
Dude, Ike isn't dead,
he's in Nebraska.

223
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:37,286
- What, what, what?!?! - Dude,
you shouldn't have told them that,

224
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,687
now they're gonna find him
and cut off his penis.

225
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:42,158
- Fireman! - Oh, who the hell cares?
He's not even my responsibility.

226
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,459
Hey you guys, look out.

227
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,726
- Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
- You bastards.

228
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,278
Yea, let us ponder the Lord's
mercies. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

229
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,166
Get out of the way
you damn hippie.

230
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,567
I don't need to take your right
wing authoritative bullshit.

231
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,720
- What? - Uhh, you're just
like the government, man.

232
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,915
Trying to prosecute out of one
side of your mouth, mmkay,

233
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,016
while supporting guns out
of the other, mmkay?

234
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:17,717
Oh, why don't you go to
a Grateful Dead concert?

235
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:20,819
I can't man, Jerry
Berry's dead, mmkay?

236
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,920
Hey man, I overheard what
you said. That was cool.

237
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,800
Wha, oh, thanks man.

238
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:30,238
Would you like to come over
to my place and finger-paint?

239
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:34,725
Sure man, finger-paintin's
cool, mmkay?

240
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:43,204
- Now where did you leave him young
man? - Ah, how the hell should I know?

241
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:48,641
- Gerald, do something about your smart-ass
son. - Uh, mind your...mother, smart-ass.

242
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:52,681
If we don't find him, so help me, you're
going to be grounded for a month.

243
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,296
All this time, look out for your little brother
Kyle, take care of your little brother Kyle,

244
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:57,697
and he wasn't even
really my little brother.

245
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:02,047
- Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't
make him any less your brother. - Yeh, right.

246
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:06,123
Excuse me, we're looking for a
two-year old Canadian boy.

247
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,478
Two-year old Canadian boy,
two-year old Canadian boy...

248
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:10,877
Oh, I think they might have
one of those down at Hap's bar.

249
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,879
Huh, come on!

250
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:22,527
- Ike!!
- Babaturtle.

251
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:25,679
Hey lady, that's my table
post, you can't have that!

252
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:35,285
Wow man, you know it's like, you go through
life thinking you're an individual, mmkay?

253
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:41,483
Then you realize that you're more than that,
mkay? We're all just one big individual, 'kay?

254
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:48,399
Let's get married and have
a honeymoon in India.

255
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:55,004
Now you march to your room and
you think about what you've done!

256
00:17:55,128 --> 00:17:58,245
- But first apologize to your
brother! - He's not my brother!

257
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:01,838
- Apologize to him!
- I'm sorry Ike. - Uhuh forget that.

258
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:10,446
Wow, this is so beautiful.

259
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,446
I am one with the animals,
and the trees.

260
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:15,923
And I am one with you.

261
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:19,120
At long last I have found

262
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,126
a true reason to be

263
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,842
Now I feel I can start a new

264
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:36,720
- What the hell is going on? - Tough love
Mr. Mackee, we're taking you to rehab.

265
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,965
I don't want to go to rehab,
I haven't even done drugs in weeks.

266
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,953
We were wrong for shunning you
Mr. Mackee, and we apologize.

267
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,654
We should have realized
you needed help.

268
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,640
Yeh, and now we're going to make
sure you get the help you need.

269
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:50,726
- I don't want help!
- You'll thank us later.

270
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,165
Hello Tom, hello Patty, thanks
for coming to Ike's Bris.

271
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,844
Look Ike, it's your
Uncle Murray.

272
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:01,198
Hello Ike, say
where's little Kyle?

273
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:03,452
He's been sent to his
room for being a bastard.

274
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:06,053
He's decided that Ike isn't his
brother since he's adopted.

275
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,642
- Hi there.
- Hello, do I know you?

276
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:12,477
Oh no, but I never miss a Bris.
Here, I brought some dip. - Oh, thanks.

277
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,202
Well, I guess the chopping
is about to commence.

278
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:16,503
Odifaner.

279
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,680
What do you want?

280
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,581
I want to secom odifaner.

281
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:26,441
Oh no you don't. That isn't
going to work on me, Canadian.

282
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,121
- Maybe you're being too
hard on him dude.

283
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,022
No way, there's no real connection
between us. It was all a big lie.

284
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:34,623
Cookie monster.
Two, three, four, five.

285
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:38,038
Go on Canadian, beat it! I'm
through getting in trouble for you.

286
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,839
Brother, fire fly.

287
00:19:41,408 --> 00:19:44,525
You have to admit you have a
problem before anybody can help you.

288
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:48,436
- But I don't think I really have a
problem. - Nonsense, you did drugs.

289
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,878
- I suppose you forgot all about your
family. - I don't really have a family.

290
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,647
- And you lost your job.
- No, I lost my job before that.

291
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,804
Mr. Mackee, you're supposed
to be an adult.

292
00:19:56,805 --> 00:19:59,705
The problem with drugs is that
people forget to stop doing them.

293
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,119
There is a time and a place for everything
Mr. Mackee, and it's called college.

294
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:07,241
Now, I want you to repeat
after me, "drugs are bad."

295
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:11,324
- Drugs are bad.
- Drugs are bad.

296
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:14,120
Uh, d, Drugs are bad.

297
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:20,878
Hello Dr. Schwartz. Thank you so much for
coming all this way to perform Ike's Bris.

298
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:24,239
Oh, my pleasure Sheila. I brought
the normal cutting device,

299
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:27,917
but then I remembered Ike is
Canadian, so I brought the right one.

300
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:31,006
- Where is the little rug rat?
- Right over here.

301
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,838
Come here you!

302
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,764
Odifaner.

303
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:47,367
Shecaca madifaner.

304
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:51,518
There you are, come
on Ike, it's time.

305
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,278
You stay away from
my little brother!

306
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:58,313
- But, but, but son I just... - You
aren't going to cut off his wee-wee!

307
00:20:58,314 --> 00:20:59,914
Not today you sick ass weirdo!

308
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:03,967
- Kyle, what are you talking about?!?
- And you, you should be ashamed of yourself.

309
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:07,239
Don't you understand that us
males are defined by our firemen?

310
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:12,965
Yes, the fireman is very magical. If you
rub his helmet, he spits in your eye.

311
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:17,687
Kyle, a, a circumcision is a very
common thing for Ike to have.

312
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:22,836
His father had it, his grandfather
had it, and... his brother had it.

313
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,758
- No! No it isn't true! - We're not
gonna cut it off, we're just gonna snip it.

314
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,606
So it looks bigger.

315
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:35,996
- Oh hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea.
- Yeh, I want to get a circumsticion too.

316
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:40,198
- Congratulations Mr. Mackee.
You are fully recovered.

317
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,899
I can't thank you enough
for everything.

318
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,677
- I feel like my old self again.
- Just one more thing.

319
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:52,280
- Remember that you can stay sober.
- I will Ms. Social Worker.

320
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,364
I will, mmkay?

321
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:59,321
- It's ok Ike, I'm here.
- And a one, and a two, and a...

322
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:00,439
Bris.

323
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,840
Ouch babababa.

324
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,041
Cookie monster.

325
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:08,922
- Ike, you're ok. - Wow dude, I guess
having a Bris isn't all that bad.

326
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:10,468
Yeh, you know, I've learned
something today.

327
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:13,769
Family isn't about whose blood you have,
it's about who you care about.

328
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:17,767
And that's why I feel like you guys are
more than just friends. You're my family.

329
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,088
- Except for Cartman.
- Naturally.

330
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,089
Well, screw you guys, I don't want to be
in your penis chopping family anyway.

331
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:29,142
And so now children, your school
counselor is back to tell you first hand

332
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:32,106
- about his nasty experience
with drugs and alcohol.

333
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:40,678
Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the
bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck.

334
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,764
Well, I didn't even care about money.

335
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,799
I was, I was wasting my life.

336
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,759
Hey, you guys want to come
to my Bris tomorrow?

337
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:49,129
You can't have your Bris tomorrow,
that's when I'm having mine.

338
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,167
No way, I set up mine
first, hippie!

339
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,490
No boys, you need to
listen up, mmkay?

340
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:56,491
What, what I'm talking about might
save your life someday, mmkay?

341
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:59,207
- Okay Mr. Mackee, mmkay?
- Mmkay.

342
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:06,960
Now, as I was saying, drugs are
bad. You shouldn't do drugs.

343
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:11,887
If you do them, you're bad,
because drugs are bad, mmkay?

344
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:17,036
It's a bad thing to do drugs, so don't
be bad by doing drugs, mmkay?

345
00:23:17,168 --> 00:23:19,600
That'd be bad. Cause
drugs are bad, mmkay?
