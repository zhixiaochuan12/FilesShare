1
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:57,436
And now back to hunting and killing with
South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned.

2
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,479
I'm Jimbo Kerny and this
is here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.

3
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,838
- Nnnhi, Ned.
- Now, isn't that great?

4
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,377
We have a terrific
show for you today.

5
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,778
We're gonna kill some elk and
we're gonna kill mountain goats.

6
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:14,200
Now the new law passed by Colorado
legislature which Ned and I call pussy law #4

7
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,835
states that we can no longer
kill animals in defense.

8
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,636
In otherwords our old line of
"It's coming right for us"

9
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:20,961
It's coming right for us.

10
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:25,478
No longer works. So now we only kill
animals to quote "Thin out their numbers".

11
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:30,397
If we don't hunt, these animals will grow to big in
their number and they won't have enough food.

12
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:35,078
So you see, we have to kill
animals, or else they'll die.

13
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:42,525
Ah, so roll the tape. Here we are up at
Shafer's crossing looking for some animals.

14
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:46,242
Lookee Ned, there's some deers.
Quick Ned, thin out their numbers!

15
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,642
Thin out their numbers.

16
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,877
Good work Ned,
now they won't starve.

17
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,795
That sure was a great hunting trip,
we saved those deer from extiction.

18
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,440
Mmmwere environmentalists.

19
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:03,924
Coming up next, we're gonna drop some
nepalm on an unsuspecting family of bevers.

20
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:08,006
And also try the numbers of
some endangered species.

21
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:14,837
Mr.Garrison? What's Vietnam?

22
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:19,119
What's Vietnam. A question a child
might ask, but not a childish question.

23
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:23,879
Children for the next few days
we'll be learning all about Vietnam.

24
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:27,716
Chances are that somebody in your own
lives was affected by this incredible war.

25
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:31,237
That's right Mr.Garrison, the
Vietnam war was sticky and icky.

26
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,403
Mr.Garrison?
Were you in Vietnam?

27
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,756
Come on Ned, let's go.
Jump into the chopper.

28
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:45,158
- Who's next to take a shower?
- Me, I am.

29
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:49,758
Where could I hide this big pipe?

30
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:53,277
No I wasn't in Vietnam. But
sometimes I like to pretend I was.

31
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:56,558
Anyway children, I gonna
assign you all a paper.

32
00:03:56,687 --> 00:04:01,363
I you all to find somebody in your own life who
was in Vietnam, and interview them about it.

33
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,682
What if we don't know anybody
who was in Vietnam?

34
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,262
Then you get an F, fail the 3rd
grade and have to get a job

35
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:09,363
cleaning septic tanks to
support your drug habit.

36
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:10,750
Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.

37
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,651
Hey yeah, he and Ned did
that stupid TV show.

38
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:17,726
And now time for Jimbo's
Mysteries of the Unexplained.

39
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:22,443
One of our loyal viewers from South
Park, sent us some 8 millimeter film

40
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,604
of what he claims to be the Mexican
Staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka.

41
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,993
Now as you all know the Mexican
Staring frog of Southern SriLanka

42
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,394
can supposedly kill you
with one hoard daze.

43
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:36,037
If the person even so much as looks into the
frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed or even die.

44
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,112
And this film proves that that
frog may very well exist.

45
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:43,713
Now watch carefully, you're gonna
see the Mexican Staring Frog.

46
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,400
There! There, did you see it?
Roll that back again.

47
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,437
Now freeze it.

48
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:54,116
Well I'd like to know what all you skeptiks out
there say now. What do you think, Ned?

49
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:56,761
- I'm scared.
- Well be sure to join us next time,

50
00:04:56,887 --> 00:05:02,280
we're so glad you spend your time with us, while
we slaughtered our way through nature's guts.

51
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,045
Come again and stay a while,

52
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:08,046
- we'll kill a lotmore living things and
make them bleed. - MMgood night.

53
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,998
And we're cut.
Great show guys.

54
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,339
Oh look who's here,
my little nephew Stanley.

55
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,440
So you interested in your uncle
Jimbo's big TV show, huh?

56
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,755
No, we have to do a
stupid report on Vietnam.

57
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:19,356
You and Ned are the only guys
we know who were there.

58
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,166
- Oh yeah we sure were.
- Was it fun?

59
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:25,040
Cartman! What kind of stupid ass
question is that. Of course it was fun!

60
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:30,241
Well sure Vietnam was fun, but not like going
to the circus fun, or fly fishin' in Montana fun.

61
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,726
No, Vietnam was more like shoving
shards of broken glass up your ass,

62
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:36,327
and then sittin' in a tub with
tobasco sauce fun.

63
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:38,722
Yeppers, that's where
me and Ned met.

64
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,958
I remember I just gotten
off the Ferris Wheel.

65
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:55,716
Oh boy what a
gorgious day.

66
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:05,604
Kurns get over here! The new privates are here.
I'm assigning one of them to you as a tranee.

67
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,763
- Ned Gurblansky reporting sir.
- Thanks Ned.

68
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,654
Now the bad guys have been spotted
about 10 clicks North of here.

69
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:14,255
I know that you and Kurns are
best suited to take em out.

70
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,323
- Are you up for it?
- Sir yes sir!

71
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:21,402
Standing without on, just me and
Ned to win the war for America.

72
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:25,281
- Pass me some cocoa will you Ned? - Certainly,
and would you like another muffin as well?

73
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:28,205
Why the hell not?
We're at war.

74
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:33,036
- Hey you know those things are bad for your
throat. - Naw, that's all lies. I'll be fine.

75
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,955
- Charlies at 2 o'clock!
- I see em! Drop the bomb!

76
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,237
- The bomb's not releasing!
- Oh no!

77
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,165
- It won't budge.
- We only have one option!

78
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:46,797
- What are you doing man? - We'll
have to take em out Ned, at all costs.

79
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:49,919
Die you red comi bastards!

80
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:02,438
Oh no! Out of ammo!

81
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:21,042
- We did it Ned! We killed the entire
Vietcong army! - Whoopie.

82
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,163
Let's get back to base camp. We can
ride the log ride before it closes.

83
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:32,006
- nd that's the way it happened boys.
- Whoa, Vietnam was sweet.

84
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:35,358
Great news guys. Your TV
show ratings have doubled!

85
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,924
- They've gone from 6 people, to 12!
- Holy smokes! We could get an emmy!

86
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:45,760
You've got to do it J, your ratings are being
killed by the Jimbo and Ned hunting show.

87
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,243
- But I don't really care about that.
- Well you better care Mr.Smartypants.

88
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,808
No ratings means no show.

89
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,909
If you want to keep reaching out to people,
you have to keep up with the times.

90
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,442
- Oh alright. - Alright
we're 10 seconds to air guys.

91
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,762
Remember, big, big , big!

92
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:01,242
And 5, 4, 3...

93
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:04,885
It's your hour of power, on midday
mountain cable access.

94
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,000
Put your hands together
and welcome

95
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:12,400
the only man in town who always has a
full in stock wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeesus

96
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,639
Christ!

97
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Uh...hi.

98
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:21,935
Ah, ye, yeah. Ok. Beggining today we're
taking the show in a new direction.

99
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:26,037
We've got some interesting people coming
on the show this week for you, our viewers.

100
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:29,239
Today's guest is TV's Gilligan,
Mr.Bob Denver!

101
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,246
Here is Bob Denver!

102
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:38,805
- Hi, Bob Denver.
- Hi, Jesus, great to be here.

103
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,841
- So Bob, so you just get in town?
- Yep, just got in.

104
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:52,439
- So..um...so what have you been up to?
- N..nothing. Nothing really at all.

105
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:57,281
Nothing from nothing means nothing.

106
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,045
You gotta have something...

107
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:05,122
And after killing the entire Vietcong
army, they returned to base camp.

108
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:08,683
Once there they rode the Devil's Drop
Rollercoaster, and ate cotton candy.

109
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:13,676
And ultimately, Ned got the purple heart
for his courageous defense of the log ride.

110
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,037
So was the horror
of Veitnam. The end.

111
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,078
- The end.
- Are there any questions?

112
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:23,598
- Yes Mr.Garrison? - Yes, uh where the fuck
did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?

113
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,365
From Veitnam veteran.

114
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,015
Well boys, it's obvious to me
that you didn't do your work

115
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:31,616
and that you stayed up all night
making up some ridiculous lie.

116
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
- No, no we didn't!
- You all receive an F... minus!

117
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,361
- F minus? Can he do that?
- But, but we're not making it up! It...

118
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:42,322
Stanley the Vietnam war was war. There weren't
galloping steeds or singing birds or logrides.

119
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,267
- How do you know? You weren't
even there! - Well that's it!

120
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:47,268
All of you have detention for
the rest of the week!

121
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:57,620
Welcome to detention, mmkay. Mr.Garrison
told me about your little joke.

122
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,688
So it's important for you all to
know why you're in detention

123
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,389
for you to obtain the full benfits from it.

124
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:06,938
You're here because you were inferior mmkay.
You're here because you're akward, mmkay.

125
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:10,901
Well thanks a lot for having such a cool
uncle that got us all detention for a week.

126
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,495
Yeah dude, your uncle
Jimbo sucks ass!

127
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,346
Why would he just invent a story
instead of telling us the truth?

128
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:20,747
Well let's see maybe because
he's an old drunk hillbilly dick!

129
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,385
- We've gotta get him back dude!
- Totally!

130
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:25,863
- How?  - Well he screwed us by making
something up, I say we do the same thing!

131
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:30,538
- What do you mean? - Did you guys ever
see that one Brady Bunch where the guys...

132
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,783
Oh, yeah sweet.

133
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:36,978
Oh yeah sweet!

134
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:43,020
And now back to huntin' and killing with
South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!

135
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:46,264
Welcome hunters. Boy have
we got a show for you today.

136
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,619
We've just received a tape from
another viewer who filmed

137
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,820
the Mexican Staring frog of Southern
SriLanka right here in South Park.

138
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,706
Yes now we're about to roll
the film but remember,

139
00:10:55,827 --> 00:11:00,059
if you look the Mexican Staring Frog
in the eyes, you can go catatonick.

140
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:04,544
We don't know if this applies to pictures of the
frog or not, but who wants to take chances?

141
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,659
So when we roll this film,
be sure to look away.

142
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:10,702
Ok, roll the film, Tom.

143
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,423
Is it over?

144
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,822
Ok, it's over.
Well there you have it.

145
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:20,576
Undeniable proof that the Mexican
Staring Frog of Southern SriLanka exists.

146
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:23,175
And you saw it here on
the Jimbo and Ned show.

147
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,887
- Dude, I can't believe they fell for it.
- Yeah, what a couple of dumbasses!

148
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:30,088
Yeah, they're a couple of
bitch ass motherfuckers!

149
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,980
- Come one we gotta go make
another one! - Lying kicks ass!

150
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,426
Jesus!

151
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,312
We're in trouble.
The Jimbo and Ned show,

152
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:40,413
they got some ridiculous staring frog story,
and jumped another 2 points in the ratings.

153
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:43,147
- Uh-oh. So what are we supposed
to do? - I don't know.

154
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,737
We'll have to continue with the changes
we've made and then... go even further.

155
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:51,418
- And we're back in 5, 4, 3...
- Remember, big big big!

156
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,043
If you're just joining us,
we've been listening to

157
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:02,744
Michelle's incredible story of
survival. Go on Michelle.

158
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:06,741
Well as I was sayin', I tried and tried but
my overturned car just wouldn't budge.

159
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,242
My husband was trapped
for 12 hours.

160
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:11,813
-And yet somehow he
managed to survive.

161
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,714
That's right. He's a very brave
man and I love him very much.

162
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:18,502
- I love you too. - Well, let's see
if the audience has any questions.

163
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:24,259
- Yes, you over there. - I think she
needs to kick him to the curb baby.

164
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:28,578
- Kick who to the curb?
- Her no good husband.

165
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:33,462
She's gotta loose that zero
and get herself a hero.

166
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,862
- But... - He wants to have
his cake and eat it too.

167
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,038
He's gotta dump that trash girlfriend.

168
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,539
It's all about respect, you gotta
have respect for yourself.

169
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,778
I think we've somewhat missed the
point here. Let's go to somebody else.

170
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:51,107
- Yes your comments. - Montel, I think
we're forgetting something

171
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,608
very important in all of this.

172
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:54,249
Ok, sure he touched
some children.

173
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,350
But the man is a great singer, and has
entertained us for so many years.

174
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,549
- What, what are
you talking about?

175
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,850
Michael Jackson. All this bad
mouthing, putting the man down,

176
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:09,056
maybe he did touch some children now
and then. But come on it's Michael Jackson!

177
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,096
Uh, we'll be back right
after these messages.

178
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:15,825
- Ready you guys?
- Ready!   - Ok, action.

179
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:23,541
I am the deadly Mexican Staring
Frog of Southern Sri Lanka.

180
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,420
I am very scary,
and dangerous.

181
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,419
- Cut! Cartman!
- What?

182
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:30,503
- It's supposed to be a frog!
- I know that.

183
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:34,586
- Since when do frogs talk Cartman?
- It's a Sri Lanka frog!

184
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,504
- Durr Cartman!
- Durr yourself hippie!

185
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,699
- Just do it again Cartman and don't
make it talk! - Ok here we go. Ready?

186
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,022
- Are you ready Cartman?
- I'm ready Steven Spielberg!

187
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,945
- Action.
- Wehehe, screw you guys.

188
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:50,582
- But why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
- Cause old ladies are fat and you are too.

189
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,933
- Come on Cartman. The way we're shooting
this, nobody will even know it's you.

190
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,034
They better not.

191
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,437
When I yell action, you
start to walk this way.

192
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,438
And Kenny's gonna pull the plastic frog in
front of you and you have to be scared.

193
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,619
- Scared? Of a plastic frog?
- It's acting Cartman.

194
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,840
You have to pretend you're really
scared then the Mexican Staring Frog

195
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,841
will look you in the eyes then you fall
down like you're dead ok, ready?

196
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,905
- This is stupid.
- Good and action!

197
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,968
Well it appears as thought a lot of
you skeptics thought that the film

198
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,009
we showed of the Mexican Staring Frog
of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake.

199
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,262
They say it didn't harm anybody.

200
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:28,507
Well it just so happens that we just received another
film from another anonymous viewer. Roll it.

201
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,395
There you go. Proof that
not only is this frog real,

202
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:40,796
but it is doing harm to the people
of South Park as we speak.

203
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:43,421
- Mmdamn that frog.
- Well that does it.

204
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:46,619
All this week Ned and I will be risking
lives from him as we go on location

205
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,820
to hunt the Mexican Staring Frog of
Southern Sri Lanka. Join us won't ya.

206
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:55,862
Oh no no no, this is the biggest publicity stunt
I've ever seen. Damn those hunters are clever.

207
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,296
- Uh, clever?
- It's genious, it really is.

208
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:02,102
Hell I want to watch them hunt the
Mexican Staring Frog. Unless.

209
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:05,503
- Unless what? - Unless we can prove to the
world that the whole things is a sham.

210
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:08,019
If we prove that the Mexican Staring
Frog from Southern Sri Lanka

211
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,220
is just something made up
by Jimbo and Ned

212
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,775
we can have them taken off
the air perhaps even killed!

213
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,740
Look, why don't we just stick to our
own show? People will watch again.

214
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:20,019
Oh J, you are so omnipotent
and yet so naive.

215
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:24,220
We'll launch a full investigation and then in the
meantime we can cash in on the video tapes.

216
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:25,541
What video tapes?

217
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:29,421
- Yay my children, I am the way and the
light. - You've seen Jesus and pals,

218
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:33,506
now you've got to get the video.
Jesus and pals too hot for TV.

219
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:37,745
Things get a little out of control.
You won't believe your eyes!

220
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:43,187
Order now, only $19.95! Remember
this is stuff you can't see on TV!

221
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:47,244
- Anonymous tip? - Yeah it was
left on our answering machine.

222
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,361
All they said was that they saw
the Mexican Staring Frog

223
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,032
just South of Stark's
Pond this morning.

224
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:54,278
Hey Ned, remember that time we got
that anonymous tip back in Nam?

225
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:57,365
- You were in Nam? Where were
you statione? - MMDenang.

226
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:00,001
- With the log ride?
- Yep.   - Man I was it Tet.

227
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,881
We had a bad ass rollercoaster,
but all we ever wanted was a log ride.

228
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:07,920
We waited and we waited,
but they never built us one.

229
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,403
I think Danforth wanted the log
ride more than anybody, but he,

230
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:14,706
he had to settle with that lame
dinosaur water adventure ride.

231
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,007
That war was hell
on everybody.

232
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:22,422
Ok, ok, ok bye. Great news everybody,
this week's ratings are through the roof!

233
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,823
We're up to 20 people!

234
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:26,242
- Wow! Do we get more money?
- No, but I do.

235
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,139
We're now the highest rated show
on mountain cable access.

236
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,040
God bless the
Mexican Staring Frog.

237
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,840
- Dude they're gonna look so stupid.
- Heh, totally.

238
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,596
- They diserve for lying to us, dude.
- Revenge is so very very sweet.

239
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:39,683
They're here, hurry and hide.

240
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:45,520
- Let's hunt. - We'll start with a 2-shot of you
and Ned getting your equipment together and..

241
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,683
- Jimbo look!
- Hit the deck!

242
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,802
- What is it? - It's him. The Mexican
Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka.

243
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,679
He's right over there
on that rock.

244
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:57,038
Dumbass! You've gotta keep your
eyes away from him! Stay down.

245
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:01,319
- Ned you take flight position, I'll try and keep
it turned away from you. - RRroger that.

246
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:04,235
Hello fellow hunters, have we
got a show for you today.

247
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:08,736
The Mexican Staring Frog is sunning
itself on a rock directly behind us.

248
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:13,716
We've gotta take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna
create a diversion using this incendiary device.

249
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,407
While Ned will ambush
him from the rear.

250
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:22,202
Now Ned, he's not looking! Quick
Ned, hit him with the shot gun!

251
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,283
Now Ned! Ned? Ned?

252
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:30,284
Oh no.

253
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,006
Come on Ned buddy,
snap out of it!

254
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,199
- Come back to me, buddy.
- You getting all this?

255
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,197
Hold on to your butts.

256
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,636
Take that you demon frog!

257
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:45,476
Ned, Ned, can you hear me? Quick, somebody
call and ambulance, this man is catatonick!

258
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,326
- Get the flight for life helicopter.
- Holy crap dude.

259
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:54,646
My pony boar was beat up pretty
bad. He kept saying "Stay Gold."

260
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,714
Aww Ned, if you can hear me,
you gotta snap out of it.

261
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:02,215
Cause if you don't I'll
never forgive myself.

262
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:06,115
Oh Stanley he's gone! My only
friend in the world is gone!

263
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,681
- Dude, he's ok. That frog
wasn't even real. - Look.

264
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,213
- Ahh! What the hell are you doing!
I almost looked right at it!

265
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:14,204
Dude, it's just a plastic frog,
it's not real, check it out.

266
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,402
- What? - We shot all those
videos and sent them in.

267
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:19,599
Yeah, we made the whole thing up.
It was all just a really, really, funny joke!

268
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:22,878
- You sent in those videos?!?!?
- Oh this is not good.

269
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:27,000
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna
be the laughing stock of South Park!

270
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:29,793
Oh come on, Ned's faking it!
That frog was just a piece of plastic.

271
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:31,594
Yeah, come on Ned,
quit faking.

272
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:36,556
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked
out by the idea of the Mexican Staring frog

273
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,837
that he must've set himself
into a deep coma.

274
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:43,677
It's a psychosomatic response! I couldn't
help over hearing your conversation just now.

275
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:47,561
- Who are you? - I produce a little TV show
called Jesus and Pals, you might've heard of it.

276
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:51,600
Your story's amazing. Full of jealoucy,
deplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.

277
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,591
Ahhhh... thanks?

278
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,780
How would you like to share your remarkable
story with us on tomorrow's show?

279
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:02,720
We're back with Jimbo and his nephew Stan.
These kids can't stop lying can they?

280
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,876
That's right Jesus,
no respect for their elders.

281
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,877
As some of you may know I
host a local show on hunting.

282
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,360
Thanks. We've been hunting the
Mexican staring frog for a week,

283
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,761
based on some video footage
we received from a viewer.

284
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:18,044
Well, it turns out that these
kids faked the footage.

285
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:21,000
- Is that true Stan? - It was just a joke.
We didn't think it would hurt anybody.

286
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:25,363
Uh, we'll find out more about
this debauchery when we return.

287
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:29,640
- And we're out.
- You're corpses up here.

288
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,520
- We need a lot more action from
everybody. - Like what?

289
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:36,356
Like go ahead and tell how your nephew
Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.

290
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,047
- Satan got it. - Whoa! I don't take drugs
and worship Satan! That's lying!

291
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,610
- Give your attention on medicine
you little fibber!

292
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:42,611
You kids, I didn't bring you on
this show to be boring!

293
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:47,003
- Somebody get pissed off and throw
a chair and Ned here! - Dibs!

294
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:51,006
Remember, you all start a fight after
the chair is thrown, that's your cue.

295
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:57,122
Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo,
why do you think little Stanley lies?

296
00:19:57,247 --> 00:20:01,957
I'll tell you why. Because he's on
drugs, and he worships the devil!

297
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,241
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

298
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:09,962
Wow, now Stanley, it sounds like your
uncle's really worried about you.

299
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:13,397
Well I only did it because...
he molested me!

300
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,080
- Why you little piece of crap.
- You big piece of crap!

301
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:20,040
That's it,
now I'm all pissed off!

302
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:23,079
- Take that hippie!
- Jesus, Jesus.

303
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:28,843
- Uh, ok ok, that's enough.
- Take that you asshole!

304
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,765
- What the fuck was that?
- Uh, let's watch the language people.

305
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:35,084
- Get outta here you bitch!
- Ay get off of him you fucking nutsack!

306
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,841
Let's all make our way
back to our seats.

307
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:46,555
- Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

308
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:53,404
Let's all just make our
way back to our seats.

309
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,837
SHUT THE FUCK UP!!

310
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,347
Jesus! What is wrong with you people??
Look around you Stanley.

311
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:04,048
Look at all the pain and suffering
your lie has caused.

312
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:06,141
Well we only did it cause
Jimbo lied to us first.

313
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,842
We had this report on the
Vietnam War for school,

314
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,838
and we interviewed Jimbo
about it and he made up

315
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,339
all this stuff about Vietnam
and he got us in trouble.

316
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:14,877
Hey now, everything I told you boys
about the war, actually happened.

317
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,651
Mr.Garrison said that there
was no way that you

318
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,752
could've defeated the entire
Vietcong army by yourself.

319
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:23,722
- The entire Vietcong army?? - I ah, well ok,
I migth've embelished the truth a little

320
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,758
- but that's different.
- Is it?

321
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:29,436
Well sure I mean,
well no I guess not.

322
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:32,117
- And as for you Stan, I think you
need to kick your drug habit...

323
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:34,018
Wait a second. I don't
take drugs, that was a lie.

324
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,521
- Wait, Jimbo made that up?
- No. Your producer did!

325
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:39,241
- She made Jimbo tell everybody
that I did drugs. - What?

326
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:42,561
During the break, your producer came over,
and told Jimbo what to say about me.

327
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,562
She told him to lie.
It's true she did.

328
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:48,963
- I'm such a tool.
- Oh really?

329
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:50,779
- Yeah then she told us to
throw a chair at Ned.

330
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,180
Yeah I didn't wanna do it Jesus,
they made me do that.

331
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:57,166
- Screw this show, I thought this was
all real. - Wait everybody, come back.

332
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:02,042
Don't feel too bad Montel. We all wanna
touch children sometimes, it's only natural.

333
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:08,157
Alright Stan, I was just trying
to tell a good story.

334
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,936
I never meant for you
boys to get in trouble.

335
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:11,340
Well we're sorry too uncle Jimbo.

336
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,141
We're sorry for making you look
stupid in front of the whole world.

337
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:16,161
Yeah, and we're sorry for turning
Ned into a vegetable. - Ahh he'll be fine.

338
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,002
I'll just take him home and
show him some good

339
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:21,405
 hard core porn, he'll snap
right out of it, won't you Ned?

340
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,284
I want to appologize to all of you
for what happened in there.

341
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:28,085
In our competition for ratings we all lost sight of
why we got into showbusiness in the first place.

342
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:32,445
- Yeah, TV's and beer. - Actually I was
referring more to the persuit of truth,

343
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:37,004
well anyway I can't wait to get back to my old show
without all the glitz and ratings and producers.

344
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,595
- Wait a sec, where is your producer?
- I sent her away.

345
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,763
Sent her away where?

346
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:47,479
- What is this? What's happening??
- Welcome to my dominion!

347
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,841
Ah, take a load off,
put your feet up.

348
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,742
Me and Satan were just aboot to go
shopping for furniture. Come on Satan!

349
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,559
Ok honey.
