1
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,169
Well detective it looks like
you fooled them again.

2
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,370
Well then it is work I guess.

3
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:41,066
I just hope that next time,
I don't have to run so much.

4
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,420
Ok children, what do you
think Barneby Jones

5
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:49,121
meant when he said this is
not a victimless crime?

6
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:50,780
Anybody?

7
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:52,529
Children, were you paying attention?

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,633
Mr.Garrison, we've been watching
Barneby Jones repeats for 8 days now.

9
00:00:55,634 --> 00:00:56,626
It's hard to keep paying attention.

10
00:00:56,627 --> 00:01:00,461
Oh well excuse me Kyle. Why don't you
just forget what Barneby Jones has to say.

11
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:04,978
Why don't you not pay attention to Barneby
Jones and let's see how far you get in society.

12
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:09,066
Ok Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barneby
Jones knew the poison was in the milk.

13
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,294
Can't we just be like normal
third graders for a little while?

14
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,895
Oh, and what do you
consider normal?

15
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,939
I dunno, like learn about Art and
Music and go on field trips and stuff.

16
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:21,138
Well Mr.Smartypants, it just so happens
we ARE going on a field trip tomorrow.

17
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,744
- To where?
- To the planetarium.

18
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:28,298
- Planetarium sucks. - Aw now what's
wrong with the planetarium?

19
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:30,861
- It's boring! - Yeah, all the
constillations look alike!

20
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:34,536
Well too bad. You're all going to the planetarium
tomorrow and you're all going to love it.

21
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,706
In the meantime we're going to watch
episode number 203, Barneby Under Siege.

22
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:42,261
Oh sorry, I taped these at home
so there's more commercials.

23
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:44,582
Hey kids, do you
love Cheesy Poofs?

24
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:49,349
Well Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid
to sing the happy Cheesy Poof song.

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,850
Watch for our talent van as it
goes around the country!

26
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:53,612
I can sing the cheesy poof song!

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,013
If you win, you can be picked to be in
our next Cheesy Poof commercial!

28
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:01,585
So remember I love cheesy poofs,
you love cheesy poofs

29
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,096
if we didn't eat cheesy
poofs we'd be lame...

30
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:08,339
Ok children let's quiet down, so the
bus driver can consentrate on the road.

31
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,537
That ain't how you do it!
It goes like this!

32
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,578
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!!!

33
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:14,426
Ow... geezes lady!

34
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,380
THERE'S THE PLANETARIUM!!!

35
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:21,081
WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY
DOWN SO NOT TO HURT YOURSELF!!!!!!

36
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:24,518
Ok children, now I'm going to remind
you this is a planetarium.

37
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,719
Not a bancock bravo.
Let's behave ourselves.

38
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,217
Does your kid have what it takes to be
the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?

39
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:33,500
- Hey there it is! - We're going around
the country trying to find the kid

40
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,701
who can sing the Cheesy Poof
Song better than anybody.

41
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,562
I can sing the cheesy poof song with
both hands tied behind my back!

42
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:40,663
You couldn't get both your arms
behind your back fatass!

43
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:42,380
Come on Eric, we're going
to the planetarium.

44
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:45,381
But I have to go sing the cheesy poof
song for that talent vaaann!!!!

45
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,658
No you have to in this building and see
a bunch of stupid stars, now come on.

46
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:51,620
But I wanna sing the cheesy poof
song!!! You guys seriously!!!!

47
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:59,021
Hello children, my name is Dr.Adams.
Welcome to the plane-arium.

48
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,615
- I thought it was planeTArium.
- Well it is,

49
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:06,582
but I have a bone disease, which impedes
me to pronounce the T in plane-arium.

50
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:08,717
That's a pretty weird bone disease.

51
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,718
Yes perhaps some day I can get
a bone marrow transplant.

52
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:15,024
- Yes, little boy? - How long is that
Cheesy Poof van gonna be outside?

53
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:18,957
Well I don't know, but anyway boys
and girls soon you'll be witnessing

54
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,258
the wonders of the universe.

55
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:24,266
- But first I wanna show you how the
plane-arium works. - As if we care.

56
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:30,025
- Hey, who are you? - That... little Missy
here runs the big projector for us.

57
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,935
- I love my work. - Whoa dude, you're only
as old as us. Shouldn't you be in school?

58
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,456
I love my work.

59
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,259
Come on, let's get into the
plane-arium, shall we?

60
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,696
Goodmorning children and
welcome to the plane-arium.

61
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,397
We're going on a fascinating
ride through the universe.

62
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,539
So I advise you to lean back in
your chairs and get comfortable.

63
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:54,297
- This is stupid. - And now I'm going
to dim the lights, and let the stars...

64
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:56,861
- come out.
- Whoopee...

65
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,544
Here we see the constellation
called the Big Dipper.

66
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:04,245
If I project the drawing of a
big dipper on top of it,

67
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,941
we see where the
constillation gets its name.

68
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:11,140
These stars over here form the
constellation of taurus, the bull.

69
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:15,465
While these stars form the
constellation Roger Ebert.

70
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:20,502
And these two little stars over here
form the constellation, the Crusades.

71
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,018
Now stars are actually
made of hot gas.

72
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:26,626
Ah man screw this.

73
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:34,661
Now breath deep as the stars
slowly start to move in little circles.

74
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:37,723
I know that you think
plane-ariums are boring,

75
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:41,824
but I'm gonna try to change
the way you think about that.

76
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:45,462
...love cheesy poofs, if we didn't
eat cheesy poofs we'd be lame.

77
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:48,784
That was great Tommy. Tommy Fresc
from Tory Pines, he could be our winner.

78
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:51,501
Excuse me but I do believe
that sucked ass.

79
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:53,902
- Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
- Eric Cartman.

80
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,621
Alright here's Eric
Cartman giving it a shot.

81
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:03,580
Ahem... I love Cheesy Poofs, you love
Cheesy Poofs, if we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,

82
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:06,619
we'd be laaaameee!

83
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:11,946
I'm talking nightcourt in a
thrift season laaameeahhh!

84
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,460
Ah drop sucker on that!

85
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,537
Well kids how did you
like the planetarium?

86
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,660
- Oh man I don't feel so good.
- Me neither, but I loved the planetarium.

87
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:25,257
- Me too! It was sweet! - Really?
What did you like best about it?

88
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:28,703
- I don't know. I don't even remember what
happened! - Wait a minute, where's Eric?

89
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,306
- I did it! I did it!
- Did what?

90
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:34,386
- I got a callback for the cheesy poof song!
-You snuck off and sang that stupid song?

91
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:38,420
- Yeah dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
- Goodbye children, thanks for visiting.

92
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,381
Don't forget we have laser rock
shows tonight at the plane-arium.

93
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:45,704
This week is laser Kenny Logins
and laser James Taylor.

94
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,898
- My head still feels funny.
- Yeah me too.

95
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:51,705
You guys, when I'm doing that
Cheesy Poof commercial,

96
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,606
I bet I get all the
Cheesy Poofs I want.

97
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:57,820
- Like you really need it hippoass. - It's
sad how jealous you are Kyle, it really is.

98
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,343
-Ahh dude! Who the hell are you?
- My name is...

99
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,743
- Van Gather... - Van Gather?
What the hell you doing on our bus?

100
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,571
Mr.Garrison there's some freaky kid
from the planetarium on our bus!

101
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,472
Oh great then I guess
we'll have to go back.

102
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,543
No! Don't go back! No!

103
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,864
- Hey be careful asshole!
- Please don't take me back there!

104
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:18,821
- Can't...can't...
- Alright dude, mellow out, geez.

105
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:22,216
We better get him to the
nurse's office, stacked!

106
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:28,222
- Planetarium... - I'll give him a pain
killer. That should calm him down.

107
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,463
No no no pain killer!
I'll be ok!

108
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:34,182
Oh um ok, Van Galder,
I'm counselor Mackey,

109
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:38,141
have you been smoking marijuna?
Marijuana's bad, mmkay?

110
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:42,859
Must tell... the machine...
the machine is eee...

111
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:46,544
Well I've never seen anything like
this. What do you think Principal?

112
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,706
- Well whatever happened to him, happened
at the planetarium. - Ahh planetarium!

113
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,947
I think tonight the planetarium's doing laser
Logins, I might have to check it out.

114
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:08,465
- Oh man this is boring. - Yeah, who
the heck finds this stuff interesting?

115
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:13,424
- Dude this is totally killer. - I hope this
goes on for 7 months or something.

116
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:23,306
You will not remember what happens here.
To remember it will cause incredible pain.

117
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:26,178
Incredible pain.

118
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:29,182
Incredible icky pain!

119
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:33,061
- Dude, I'm totally tripping...
- Yeah, it's totally killer.

120
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:41,461
Today children we are going to learn
about Japenese poems called haikus.

121
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,748
A haiku is just like a normal
American poem except

122
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,849
that it doesn't rhyme
and it's totally stupid.

123
00:07:46,947 --> 00:07:49,905
For example...
uh... Where's Eric Cartman?

124
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:53,497
- That's a haiku? - No I'm asking
why Eric Cartman isn't at school.

125
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,895
- Was he on the school bus this morning?
- No. - Fatass Cartman... was...

126
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:01,064
the school bus today...
what a big fat turd.

127
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:06,739
Oh, very good haiku Kyle. Yes, haikus
have five syllables, then seven, then five.

128
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,664
Kenny, can you give
us another example?

129
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:14,244
When I get blowjobs... that I cum through
discharging... that's the way to fuck.

130
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:18,658
- What's a discharge? - Mr.Garrison,
since haikus suck so much ass,

131
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:21,779
- can we go back to the planitarium again?
- Yeah I wanna go to the planetarium again too!

132
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:24,785
But you were just there, why do
you wanna go again so soon?

133
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:29,820
- Yeah, why DO we wanna go again so soon?
- I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.

134
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,905
Well I guess we could go again
since it's just down the street.

135
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:38,178
Well hello, it's all my little friends
with all their little dreams.

136
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:42,061
- Eric, where have you been? - Let's see
where have I been, where have I been...

137
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,180
- Where have you been Cartman? - Well I might
have been over at the Cheesy Poof call back,

138
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:48,218
winning regional championship!

139
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,304
This is my regional championship
certificate. Do you like it?

140
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:57,182
Hey, where's your regional champion
certificate Clyde? Oh you don't have one?

141
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:02,458
Hmm, did you have a regional certificate
Wendy? No? Apparently only I do!

142
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:05,977
Ass full of pork fat...
jiggles like a jello mold...

143
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:09,742
- mouth is flapping too. - Your haiku
insults have no affect on me Kyle.

144
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:13,018
- I'm regional champion. - Does that mean you're
gonna be on that Cheesy Poof commercial?

145
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,537
It's between me and four other kids. I'm
on my way now with my mom to the finals.

146
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,977
I bet you don't win...
they don't let big fatasses...

147
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,541
- perform on TV.
- Very good Kyle.

148
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:24,498
Shut your god damn mouth...

149
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:29,655
or else I'm gonna...kick you....
squa....in the balls...

150
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,457
asshole...
ah damn it!

151
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:37,620
- Uh, how's he doing nurse?  - He's stable.
But I still can't get any information out of him.

152
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:40,136
- I'm gonna sedate him now.
- No! No drugs!

153
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:44,545
- Drugs are good, mmkay.
- Don't let them... no... planetarium...

154
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,137
- Why Van Gelder?
- The machine is...ahh...

155
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:51,779
The machine is ahh?
That's probably bad.

156
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:55,661
He's been talking about "the machine"
for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.

157
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:58,142
Why America's Funniest
Home videos?? Why??

158
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:01,225
Uh there's only one way to
get any sense out of him.

159
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:05,226
- We're gonna have to try a
mind melt, mmkay. - A what?

160
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:09,863
Well it's an ancient technique handed down
from school counselor to school counselor.

161
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:14,344
- I don't like to use it, but it may be our
only hope. - Well what will you need?

162
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:19,860
Just time to prepare nurse.
Just time....mmkay.

163
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:24,549
Well children, I'm so glad you
came back to learn more.

164
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,050
They just begged to come back, I
couldn't get them to shut up about it.

165
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:31,106
Well I'm sure we're gonna have a
marvelous time, won't we children?

166
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:35,780
- Yes. - This way please,
enjoy your visit.

167
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:41,146
illions of stars and billions of
galaxies make up our universe.

168
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:45,624
- Here you see pollarus, the dog star.
- I'm just gonna step outside and go wee-wee.

169
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,658
Certainly Mr.Garrison.

170
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:56,505
You love the planetarium. To be without
the planetarium causes you horrible pain.

171
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:59,557
All you want to do is help
the planetarium thrive!

172
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,258
To not do so makes your stomach
ache with needle like sta...

173
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:09,826
..and right over here we see the constillation
orion. Orion's belt is made up of three stars.

174
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:11,938
- Dude, what just happened?
- What do you mean?

175
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,661
Come on, we gotta get out of here
before something bad happens.

176
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:22,186
- Don't pick your nose, hon. - I wasn't
picking it, I had a itch for cryin out loud.

177
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,664
- Don't be nervous, I'm sure you'll win.
- I dunno, there's a lot of competition here.

178
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,453
You think I might win, mommy?

179
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,454
I hope so honey. Then perhaps
we can eat for a little while.

180
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:37,182
- Hey look they're giving away bread
outside! - Did you hear that mommy?

181
00:11:37,307 --> 00:11:40,538
Come on perhaps we can get
some food in our stomachs!

182
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,346
Sike!

183
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:47,064
What the hell are you boys doing,
you're supposed to be in there.

184
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:50,065
Mr.Garrison, we think that
the planetarium guy is...

185
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,302
Goodbye children,
thanks for coming.

186
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:56,818
- I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
- Oh for pete's sake Clyde, you just went.

187
00:11:56,947 --> 00:12:00,193
Well Clyde, if you like the
plane-arium so much,

188
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,794
perhaps you'd like to do some
volunteer work here.

189
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:06,536
- Yes, yes please!
- Me too I wanna do it!

190
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:11,816
- Mr.Garrison? - Well I guess I
could give them extra credit for it.

191
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:17,305
Excellent! Why don't we step over here and
I'll show all you children how to volunteer?

192
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:22,981
- Dude, this isn't right. - Why? - We're kids
dude. We don't volunteer for anything.

193
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,533
Come on, we gotta see
what's going on in there.

194
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,234
Here's the control panel
that operates all the stars.

195
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:30,299
Kenny you go out there
and tell us what you see.

196
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,978
He hits this switch.

197
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,279
I don't see it.

198
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:40,458
- You see? Nothing dude, just a
bunch of stars. - Yeah, I guess so.

199
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,859
Oh dude!

200
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:46,376
- What does that do?
- I dunno.

201
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,220
Kenny what's it doing?

202
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,258
It says "maximum".

203
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:59,106
- Oh my god! We've killed Kenny!
- We're bastards!

204
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,862
- Dude I told you something was up with this
place! - We gotta go tell somebody quick!

205
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:12,863
and GO...and Bingo was his name-o. Once a
farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o.

206
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:23,564
...And Bingo was his name-o. Once a farmer
had a dog and Bingo was his name-o.

207
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,565
...and Bingo was his naaamme-o.

208
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:33,066
Thank you, uh Peter, we'll
let you know very soon.

209
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:38,025
- Next will be uh...Eric Theodore
Cartman. - Hello everybody!

210
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:41,105
- Now just do it like we rehearsed
hon. - I know I know.

211
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:48,106
She was hogged by the money!
So hogged by her honey!

212
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:52,807
She was hogged by the money...
on the street hooray!

213
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,808
She was all about the money!
So hogged by her honey!

214
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:02,809
She was hogged by the money
so you better treat her right...

215
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:09,257
Well Eric Cartman,
that certainly was...

216
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,979
- insane.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,462
- We'll let you know.
- Thank you.

218
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:17,705
- Don't pick your nose, hon. - I'm not
picking it ma! God damn it I had a itch!

219
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:20,179
Geezes, where do we
find these people?

220
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:27,780
Our minds are one. Mmkay.

221
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:31,786
Our thoughts are one....mmkay.

222
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,863
This is the strangest
thing I've ever seen.

223
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:38,299
Please nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on
your head, you're not being very openminded.

224
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:45,300
Open your mind, to your
counselor. Open your mind.

225
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,385
- Doctor Adams...
- Yes...

226
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:52,785
- He owns the planetarium, what
about him? - He uses the machine.

227
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,296
The star machine. Mmkay.

228
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,624
He uses it to erase minds.

229
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:03,616
- But why? - Planetarium.
About to go out of business.

230
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:08,821
- Adams had to create slaves to
survive. - My god this is amazing!

231
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,223
Please nurse you're throwing
off my ching, mmkay?

232
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,911
We certainly would like to
congradulate all our finalists.

233
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:20,712
Only one of our finalists can
win the grand prize and,

234
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:24,556
- unfortunately that finalist is Eric
Cartman.  - Yes! I'm the best!

235
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:27,324
You were actually our last choice, but
the other children had unexpectedly

236
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:30,025
taken jobs as volunteers
at the planetarium.

237
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:31,964
- That's odd.
- Sweeet!

238
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,631
It appears that more and more
South Park residents are

239
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:37,732
dicovering the wonder and joy
of the planetarium.

240
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:40,424
Here with a special report is
a 34 year old Asian man

241
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:42,525
who looks strikingly simila
to Recardo Montebon.

242
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:46,590
Thanks Tom, yes indeed the planetarium
has become very popular as word spreads,

243
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:50,191
it really isn't as lame and
stupid as one suspected.

244
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:53,677
- I'm here with the planetarium
operator, Dr.Adams. - Thank you,

245
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:56,920
I'd like to open an invitation
to all South Park residents,

246
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:59,921
to come see a special
free show this evening.

247
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:05,286
I guarantee, it'll change the way
you think about the plane-arium.

248
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:10,083
So bring the whole family to the planeTArium,
for a night of excitement and wonder.

249
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:14,144
And then we turned the dial and Kenny
went into a kind of... hypnosis.

250
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:16,645
That's a pretty far
fetched story, boys.

251
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,362
- But it's true dude! - Are you boys just
sure you're not making this all up?

252
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:25,398
- Yeah, pretty sure. - Well just as soon as
I handle all the other crime in South Park,

253
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:29,257
I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium
so I can prove that nothing's wrong.

254
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:31,008
What other crime in South Park?

255
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,600
Oh yeah, let's go.

256
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:38,118
- Ok, let's shoot the commercial. Where's
our cheesy poof talent?  - I'm over here!

257
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,683
Oh you look great hon!
Mommy's fat little piggy!

258
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:47,806
- Let's hurry, this costume is hot.
- Ok roll camera, and action.

259
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,398
I love cheesy poofs,
you love cheesy...

260
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,399
Oh wait! Wait! You've got
a little eye buger hon.

261
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,121
- Oh mom for pete's sake!
- Got it!

262
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,878
- Aaand Action!
- I love cheesy poofs...

263
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:01,437
- Hold it! Cut! Can we get some more
light on that backdrop? - Sure thing!

264
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,081
- Oh man. Come on!
- Got it!

265
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,279
Ok here we go...
and action.

266
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,080
I love cheesy poofs,
you love cheesy poofs...

267
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,517
- Cut!  - What?! - I'm not liking the
shoes, can we change the shoes?

268
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:13,518
Oh god damn it!

269
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,362
Oh hello officer of the law.

270
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:20,957
- Hello Mr.Planetarium operator.
- What brings you out here?

271
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:24,626
Well these boys seem to think
you're some kind of sick weirdo

272
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,627
that's got a master plan to screw
with the minds of everyone in town.

273
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:34,046
- Oh really. - Yeah, I just thought
I'd come show them around.

274
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,476
So they know there's
nothing to be scared of.

275
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:40,839
- Actually this is a pretty inopportune
time. - Ok, I'll be quick then.

276
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,242
Of course officer. Come on in.

277
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,642
- Hello children.
- Oh no! They got Chef too!

278
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:55,444
- Welcome to the planetarium. - Well it's
nice to see you finally got a real job Chef.

279
00:17:55,567 --> 00:18:00,880
- I love my work. - I know what you mean.
I've always loved the planetarium too.

280
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:05,797
- Would you like to see the stars officer?
- NO!   - That would be super dooper!

281
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,406
Don't do it officer Barbrady!

282
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:14,120
- Hi grandma, it's me Eric. - Oh hello
Eric. Grandma sure has missed you!

283
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:18,001
I just wanted to remind you I'm gonna be
on Television Tonight, so be sure to watch.

284
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:22,355
Oh I will Eric.You know I remember
when I was a little girl

285
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:25,502
and had my first talent
show audition... - Ok bye.

286
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,322
Hello, the Marshes aren't in right
now, please leave a message.

287
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:33,025
Stan, I'm gonna be on TV
tonight, be sure to watch.

288
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,538
Hello, you've reached the Broslofski's.
Please leave a message.

289
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,722
Where the hell is everybody? I'm gonna be
on TV tonight, you guys better not miss it.

290
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:46,398
- And this is the constillation
called Casiopia. -Oh neato.

291
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:52,759
And now officer, from this moment on,
you will think that you are Elvis Presley. 

292
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:56,766
- To not be Elvis will cause
you great pain. - Pain.

293
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,483
You see children,
there's no stopping me.

294
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:02,884
Even your highly intelligent
policeman are no match for me.

295
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:05,122
- He's not highly intelligent.
- Why are you doing this, dude?

296
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:09,320
Why? Because nowadays kids have
computers, surround sound television.

297
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,721
They've forgotten all
about plane-ariums.

298
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:15,922
But I'll make them remember!
Starting with the two of you!

299
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,926
Terrance and Phillip will be right
back after these announcements.

300
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:22,446
- Oh dude here it comes!  - Packed full
of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really

301
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,147
give you that quick
pick me up.

302
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:29,238
- So remember... - I love cheesy
poofs, you love cheesy poofs.

303
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,463
If we didn't eat cheesy
poofs, we'd be...

304
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,464
Lame.

305
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,917
And now back to Terrance and Phillip.

306
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,920
Yes yes that was me!!!!

307
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,879
Ah hah! Caught you
red-handed! Mmkay.

308
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:49,445
- Mr.Mackey! - Officer Barbrady, this
man is using some kind of mind control.

309
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,567
What's wrong with him?

310
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,004
- Oh no, apparently he thinks he's Charlton
Heston. - No you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis!

311
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:05,125
Elvis, escort our guests
to the plane-arium.

312
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:09,126
Oh, if you wouldn't mind,
would you please follow me?

313
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,897
Let's begin, shall we?

00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,620
And now you will remember nothing!

315
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:23,921
Except that the plane-arium is the
best thing you've ever known.

324
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:01,622
Think hard Elvis. You're not
really the king of rock and roll.

325
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:06,377
You're a fat stupid worthless
policeman in a small town, mmkay?

326
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:09,783

worse than death counselor!
