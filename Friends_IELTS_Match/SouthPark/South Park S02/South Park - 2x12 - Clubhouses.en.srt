1
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,501
Sargent Stanley Marsh is
trapped behind enemy lines.

2
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:46,542
His only chance of survival is to sneak past
the Bosnian guard who stands watch.

3
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:51,503
Sargent Marsh knows it's now or
never. He must make a run for it.

4
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,542
The American Base is
only a few feet away.

5
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,859
Marsh assist halt!

6
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:04,740
It will take more than your weak
America weapons to destroy me.

7
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,904
- Cartman! We shot your Bosnian
fat ass! - Yeah you're dead!

8
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:11,986
- I have class 4 armor on,
that uh uh it it... - No, you don't!

9
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:15,543
Special armor that's
imperitable to American bulets.

10
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,340
Dude, every time we play
American vs Bosnian you cheat.

11
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:21,350
Yeah Cartman you suck. If you wanna
play Americans vs Bosnians anymore

12
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:23,951
you can just play with yourself.

13
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:29,063
That's fine. I like playing with myself.
I play with myself all day long!

14
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,978
- Well, now what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

15
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:35,063
- Hi, Stan.
- Hi, Wendy.

16
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:38,338
- Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty
today? - I don't know.

17
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,935
- She does! She looks very pretty!
- Ok.

18
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,262
Stan can I talk to you for a second?

19
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:53,066
Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we
fixed Kyle up with Bebe?  - No.

20
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:57,021
If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we could
invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner,

21
00:01:57,147 --> 00:02:00,776
and play parmegen, and have meaningful
conversations, and sip Konyak by the fireplace.

22
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,181
- We could?
- Yes, Stan.

23
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:06,585
- But dude, I don't have a clubhouse. - You
don't? I thought all guys had clubhouses.

24
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:13,021
- Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been
in? - Ah Cartman has ways of making you talk!

25
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:18,297
You have to build a clubhouse! So all four
of us can sit in it and play truth or dare!

26
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,186
Truth or dare?

27
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,584
- Wow! Come on Kyle, we've
got work to do! - We do?

28
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:26,744
We're gonna build a clubhouse.
I have to ask my dad for help.

29
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,983
- Did it work?
- I think it did, Bebe.

30
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,581
If all goes as planned Kyle
will be your new boyfriend.

31
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:34,582
I hope so Wendy.
He's got such a hot ass!

32
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:41,502
- Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!
- Alright Terrance!

33
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:45,176
- Oh wait wait wait. Pull harder.
- Alright.

34
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:49,299
- Damn it. Pull really hard Phillip.
- Okay!

35
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,338
Wait, Wait.

36
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,782
Oh, my...

37
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:58,583
Wait, wait.

38
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:07,057
- Oh you got me Terrance!
- Sure I do.

39
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,864
Whoa dude! Your dad is
watching Terrance and Phillip!

40
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,265
No I was just flipping
through the channels.

41
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:14,338
- Hey dad, we need to
build a clubhouse. - Ok.

42
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,265
- How do we do it? - You just
get a hammer and some wood.

43
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,343
What, some girls wanna play
truth or dare or something?

44
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,027
- Yeah dude how'd you know?
- How do you think I met your mother?

45
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:25,264
Randy, my wedding ring! I lost
it down the garbage disposal!

46
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,423
Oh brother.

47
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:32,786
Stanley, I thought I told you not
to watch this horrible cartoon!

48
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:35,023
Yeah Stanley, you
should know better.

49
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:39,425
Here Stanley you watch
nice cartoons, like Fat Abbot.

50
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:44,066
Randy, will you please come get
my wedding ring out of the sink!

51
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,023
- Hey hey hey. What's goin on Rudy?
- Man Fat Abbot, you need to loose weight.

52
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,422
I loose weight when
I feel like it bitch!

53
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,857
- Shut your bitch ass mouth hoe!
- Bitch I'll kick yo ass!

54
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,056
- Whoa dude!
- Sweet!

55
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:59,975
You think you slick you punk
ass blassemous dopefeed bitch.

56
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:05,101
I had my Jimmy waxed 7 times last
week. I busta copin yo nigga ass shit.

57
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:06,979
Wow cartoons are getting really dirty.

58
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,858
- Did you find it?
- Give me a second would you?

59
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,182
- Don't snap at me!
- I didn't snap at you.

60
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,025
- You snapped at me!
- Whatever.

61
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:17,856
Whatever?? In 15 years you've
never said what ever to me.

62
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,455
- I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

63
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:22,066
I think I found it.

64
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:25,020
- That's not it you idiot!
- Hey back off cunt!

65
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,106
- You just said the C-word!
- Did I?

66
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,763
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.

67
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:35,264
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean, when
he said we were gonna play truth or dare?

68
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,744
Just that maybe when we're finished,
Wendy and Bebe can come over and play.

69
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:43,860
- Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls
suck ass. - Oh well of course they do,

70
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:47,263
- but uh wouldn't it be sweet to play
truth or dare with them? - What? Why?

71
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,341
Because dude we could make em
do really gross stuff like eat bugs.

72
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:54,242
Hey yeah, that'd be sweet.
We could totally ruin their lives.

73
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,537
- What are you guys doing?
- We're building a clubhouse.

74
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:00,455
Ahahahha! Clubhouse! That's
the lamest thing I've ever heard.

75
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,689
It's not lame, it's sweet!
After we build this clubhouse

76
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,690
we're gonna get girls
to play truth or dare.

77
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:09,780
- Why? - Because dumbass, we can make
em do gross stuff and make them cry.

78
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:12,819
- What were you born yesterday? - Yeah now
beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private.

79
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:15,905
- That's fine, we'll build our
own clubhouse. - Fine!

80
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:18,177
Fine, and then we'll get girls
to play truth or dare too!

81
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:20,218
- Fine!
- Fine!

82
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:23,066
- Fine!
- Fine that's fine!

83
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,345
No Kenny, you can't look.
I'm the forman.

84
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,466
Well why the fuck do I have to do all
the work while you stand around?

85
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:36,096
Because Kenny, your family's poor,
you have to be the worker. No Kenny!

86
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:40,698
- How's the treehouse coming along hon?
- Mom! It's not a treehouse! It's a clubhouse!

87
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:42,624
- Sorry hon.
- Mom,

88
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:46,865
- can we pull out the carpeting in the
living room? - Well I don't know Eric.

89
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,413
If you did that, then
the floors would be bare.

90
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:54,114
But moooom! The blueprint says we need
carpeting in the clubhooouussseee!!!!!!!

91
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:58,106
- Well alright. - Kenny my mom says you
can go get carpeting in the living room now.

92
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,807
You're such a little suckup!

93
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,306
And stop your bitchin!

94
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:06,823
- What are you doing hon? - Trying to get a
cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then...

95
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:10,018
You men are all alike! First you get
a cookie and then you critisize

96
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,343
the way I dress. Then its the way I cook!
Suppose next you'll be telling me

97
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:16,844
you'll be telling me that you need your space,
and that I'm sabotaging your creativity.

98
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:21,742
- Go ahead Stanley! Get your
god damn cookie!   - Ok.

99
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:28,663
And so children, today we're gonna focus
on American History. Right Mr.Twigg?

100
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:32,416
- That's right Mr.Garrison. American history...
- When's Mr.Hat coming back?

101
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,820
- What did you say????
- When is Mr.Hat coming back?

102
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:40,498
I told you never to mention that name in my
classroom again! Mr.Hat is a two-timin whore!

103
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,380
- And now we all learn from Mr.Twigg!
- But Mr.Twigg sucks!

104
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:49,182
That's enough. Mr.Hat is gone, and he isn't
coming back, and I don't wanna hear it!

105
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:52,498
Anyway children, let's turn our
history text books to page 105.

106
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,899
Which would be right after page 104.

107
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,943
So how is your lame
ass clubhouse Stan?

108
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,376
- Better than yours fatboy.
- We'll see about that.

109
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:02,056
Don't forget you need to cut school
early and wait for the hottub Ken. - Fucker.

110
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,939
- Is your clubhouse ready?
- Almost.

111
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,661
- Stan, are you paying attention?
- Yes, Mr.Garrison.

112
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:09,096
Well then Stanley,
what did I just say?

113
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:15,342
Um, you said that even though Charle
appeared 12 times on the love boat,

114
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:19,142
the episode with captain
and Tenile got higher ratings.

115
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:24,907
- Well ok, I suppose you were paying
attention. - Good guess dude!

116
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,023
Pass this up.

117
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,103
- Pass this up.
- Pass this up.

118
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:31,785
Pass this up.

119
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:35,060
- Stanley are you passing notes
to Kyle?!? - No I just...

120
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:38,623
- Don't lie Stan. Lying makes you sterile.
- I'm not lying someone just handed me.

121
00:07:38,747 --> 00:07:41,444
Stanley, if you think it's so important
to keep interrupting my class,

122
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:45,145
then why don't you come up to the front and
read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear.

123
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,183
- But I didn't write the note!
- Mr.Garrison,

124
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:51,300
- Stan's behavior is having an adverse
affect on my education.  - Shut up, Cartman.

125
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:55,215
- Stanley Marsh, you come up here right
now and read your note!  - Oh man!

126
00:07:58,547 --> 00:08:02,017
Dear Kyle, you have
got such a great ass.

127
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,820
I could sleep for days on those
perk cheeks let me tell you.

128
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:09,760
I'd like to live with you and use
your ass as a hat for all eternity.

129
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:10,861
Whoa dude!

130
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:20,127
Young man, school is a time for learning,
mmkay. Not for immature skylarkings.

131
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:22,766
- What's sky larkings?
- You know like, Tom Fooleries.

132
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,196
- Who?
- Oh your parents are here.

133
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:31,156
Thank you for coming on such short notice. I
was just disceplining your son for his skylarkings.

134
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:35,599
- Stanley, I... skylarkings?
- Mmkay.

135
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:39,003
Stanley I want you to explain to me
why you were passing notes in school.

136
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,746
Randy, let me handle this. Now
Stanley, I want you to explain

137
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,947
to me why you were
passing notes in school.

138
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,521
It wasn't my note dude!
It was some girl's!

139
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:49,222
Ok Stanley, we're all here to get to
the root of your behavior disorder.

140
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:52,279
- You really should know better, Stanley.
- You need to shape up, mister.

141
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,638
Don't interrupt me, you always interrupt
me when I talk. Can't you see that I..

142
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,997
- I don't interrupt you!
- There you did it again!

143
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,279
He interrupted me again.

144
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,880
Mmkay, uh perhaps you should let
your wife finish talking Mr.Marsh.

145
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,212
Now Stan I want...

146
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:08,113
Oh well I'm sorry to interrupt but she
always takes over any conversation.

147
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:11,882
- Uh, taking over any conversation's
bad. - What? You're one to talk!

148
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,956
When was the last time you really
listened to what I had to say?

149
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:19,030
When was the last time you had
anything interesting to say?

150
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:21,131
It's always gossip,
stupid crap.

151
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:26,327
Apparently we have a communication problem
here. Mr.Marsh tell me how you're feeling.

152
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:30,076
I feel like everything I do is
wrong. Doesn't matter what I say.

153
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:34,200
- Mmkay, that's valid. Now uh Mrs. Marsh...
- Excuse me. - ...how do you feel?

154
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:38,286
- Like I'm a ghost! Like he sees right
through me! - Oh please!  - Hello?

155
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:42,559
- Oh please yourself!
- Who tries to control the marrige?

156
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:45,599
And by that I mean who's dominating
the aspects of the relationship?

157
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,285
- He is!
- No, she is!

158
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:49,883
Well I guess I'm wrong AGAIN!

159
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:54,541
Look at it Kenny. It is the
greatest clubhouse ever built!

160
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:57,542
And we built it with our own hands!

161
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,802
Now all we need is chics, Kenny.

162
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:03,124
- Aright, you go find chics Kenny.
- Why do I always have to go find chics?

163
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,553
Because I have to stay here and work.
I still gotta shingle the roof,

164
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,054
test the foundation,
run all kind of extentions,

165
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:13,485
I got way to much to do, and all you have
to do is go find chics. Now stop your bitchin.

166
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:18,006
Mom, can I watch
American Gladiators?

167
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:20,624
Dude where have you been?
I've been waiting all afternoon.

168
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,725
I got in trouble for that note
Bebe was trying to pass to you.

169
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,957
- To me? - I mean no,
not to you. Forget it.

170
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,535
Come on dude, we have to
finish our clubhouse quick,

171
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,536
the girls want to play
truth or dare tomorrow.

172
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,397
- We should use nails, dude.
- My mom won't let us.

173
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:37,645
- Hi guys! How's the clubhouse coming?
- Pretty good we're almost done!

174
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,076
Well hurry! We wanna
play truth or dare!

175
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:44,883
- I'm going as fast as we can! - Kyle,
could you turn around for a second?

176
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,719
Thank you!

177
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,294
Come on dude,
we have to hammer faster!

178
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,395
Hey Stan, do you know
how to play truth or dare? - No!

179
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,763
- Well dude, how are we supposed to play
it then? - I didn't even think about that!

180
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,922
-And then, they'll ask truth or dare.
- And I say, dare!

181
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:07,438
- No no! You say truth. - Truth? But that's
boring! I wanna get dared to kiss her!

182
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:11,526
You have to say truth the first few
times, or else you'll seem too eager.

183
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:16,357
You can't seem to eager, you got to play it
cool. Like you don't even care what happens.

184
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:19,923
- Then after a few truths,
you finally answer dare. - Dare!

185
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,278
But not like that, son.
Like this:

186
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,159
Daaaareaah.

187
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:29,363
- And then her little friend will dare you
to kiss Wendy. - You really think so?

188
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:34,800
Of course she will. They're women, they had this
whole thing planned out months ahead of time.

189
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:41,659
Hey hey hey.
What's goin down ya'll?

190
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,160
Hey Fat Abbot, what are you
doing on this side of the hood?

191
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:45,628
You know something Rudy?

192
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:49,229
- You're like school in summertime.
- School in summertime?

193
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:54,521
Yeah bitch! School in summer time! Open your
fucking ass nigga hole or I'll pop your bitch ass!

194
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,916
- I'll a poppa yo a bitcha assa tuba. Bitcher.
- What the hell is going on in this cartoon?

195
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:04,115
Oh hey Kenny, did you find any
chics to come to the clubhouse?

196
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,445
Hi we ran away from home.

197
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,764
Like this kid told us we might be able to crash
at your clubhouse for a couple of days.

198
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,999
Holy crap!

199
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,320
Behold, E-wak Village 2000!

200
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,999
Oh well I guess it beats living at home.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Can I offer you ladies a cool
beverage or a tasty snack?

202
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,967
- How's the clubhouse coming Stan?
- We're working on it!

203
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,705
Well I just thought I'd tell you that me
and Kenny have finished our clubhouse,

204
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:33,306
and we already have chics over.

205
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,284
No you don't!

206
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,843
- Dude! - Only a matter of time before
we're playing truth or dare with them.

207
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,403
Goodluck with your piece of
crap clubhouse asshole!

208
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:46,016
Mom, will you please ask dad to
come help me build my clubhosue?

209
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:49,317
Stanley, I think you should know
that your father has moved out.

210
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,643
- What? Why?
- Because, we're divorced Stanley.

211
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:56,476
Divorced? Oh no! Does that mean
you and dad don't love me anymore?

212
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,404
This is all my fault isn't it?

213
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:01,918
- Yeah, kind of. - Dude! You're
not supposed to say that!

214
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,835
- But I would like you to meet your
new stepfather Roy. - Hello son!

215
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,242
- What? - I'll leave you two
alone to get aquented.

216
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,962
Hello Stanley! I know this must be a very
difficult period for you right now,

217
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:15,204
and the adjustment is going to take
some time. But I'd like to be your friend,

218
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:19,286
So when you're ready I want you to feel free
to come to me with anything you might need.

219
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,956
Whether it's advice or just someone to
play catch with. You can count on me.

220
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:27,080
- This is happening way to fast. - Oh geezes
when are you gonna cut me some slack huh!?!

221
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:31,246
I have taken you under my wing and done my best,
and all you ever do is whine and moan about it.

222
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:34,484
Now for the last time
go cut some firewood!!!

223
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,962
So I'm on my way out the door. And she goes
make sure you're home before midnight.

224
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:44,000
- Oh that's weak.  - And I go listen bitch, I
don't need my mother giving me no curfew.

225
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,316
- That's killer.  - Yeah, well if
you're not home before midnight

226
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,477
don't bother coming home at all.

227
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,399
- That's totally weak.
- So I go, fine! I won't come home!

228
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,836
- Sweet. - And then she
goes fine don't come home.

229
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,118
- Gettin all in my face and crap, and
acting all tough and crap. - Killery sweet.

230
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm 16. I should be able to
do what I want, when I want.

231
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,351
I don't need her breathing down
my neck every two seconds

232
00:14:02,352 --> 00:14:03,852
telling me what I can and cannot do.

233
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,403
I had the same thing with my
mom yesterday. I'm all like:

234
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,633
AY! I'm not a little kid anymore,
ma. I'm 8 years old!

235
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:14,634
And if I wanna finger paint,
then I'm gonna finger paint!

236
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,679
- Ok, we're done. - Dude,
I don't think this is very sturdy.

237
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,171
Doesn't matter dude. It only has to last
long enough to play truth or dare.

238
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,472
- I'm gonna go get the girls.
- Ok.

239
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:31,880
- Stanley it's time to go!
- Go where?

240
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:35,295
Your bastard father has visitation rights,
and this is his time with you.

241
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,596
But ma, I have to
go get the girls to...

242
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,126
- Come on Stanley!
- Weak!

243
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:41,286
- Dad?
- Hey Stanley. Eh, hop in.

244
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,891
Listen Stanley, I know all this
change must be tough on you,

245
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:48,192
but you know your mother and I thought it
would be best for all of us if we split up.

246
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:51,119
- But I don't understand why
we have to... - Well hello ladies.

247
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:55,559
- High Handsome. We're gonna be at
Larry's bar tonight. - I'm already there.

248
00:14:56,647 --> 00:15:01,084
What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See your
mother and I still care about you and your sister.

249
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:03,141
But we just don't like being
around each other anymore.

250
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:06,442
But I don't like being around my sister
anymore, does that mean I can leave her too?

251
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,130
Well no, because you're family.
You can't just leave family,

252
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,031
you have to stick with
family no matter what.

253
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,363
But you and mom are family,
how you can just split up?

254
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,714
You know what I think? I think that
when you and mom got married,

255
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,615
you became family. And now that
you are you shouldn't be able

256
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,708
to leave her anymore
than I can leave my sister.

257
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,509
Oh Stan. You're so young
you just don't get it.

258
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,638
- Well anyway, have a nice day.
- What that's it?

259
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,600
Yeah but I loved our time together.
I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.

260
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:33,117
You know there's nothing more important
to me then you right Stan?

261
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,397
I guess, but...

262
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,282
The girls are gonna
be here any minute.

263
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:43,487
Stan if I didn't know any better,

264
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:45,788
I would think you're doing this
because you WANNA play with girls.

265
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,684
- No way dude, don't be silly.
- Come on Wendy.

266
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,197
- We have to say truth a couple of times
before we say dare. Right? - Right.

267
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:53,522
- Cause if we don't we'll seem
to eager. - To eager to what?

268
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:56,719
- To say dare dumbass! Sheez!
- Hi guys!

269
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,966
- Oh hi Wendy. What's up? - Don't
you guys still wanna play truth or dare?

270
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,999
- Yeah, I mean, sure whatever.
- Then come on.

271
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,322
- Remember, truth the first
couple of times. - Ok.

272
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,085
- Who wants to go first?
- I will!

273
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,767
Kyle? Truth or dare?

274
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,439
- Umm, dare?
- Dude!  - What?

275
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:17,476
- Kiss Bebe on the lips! - What?!
Sick dude! I'm not kissing a girl!

276
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:19,996
- Whatsa matter Kyle?
- It's just wrong that's all!

277
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:22,561
- Don't be a chicken dude, just close your eyes.
- What the hell have you gotten me into?

278
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:27,203
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing trugh
or dare right now, you want him to beat us?

279
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,280
Oh boy.

280
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:39,439
- Sick!!! Ahhhh! Fucking sickening!
- Wow, look at that ass! Shake it baby!

281
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:43,196
- Your turn Bebe.
- Ok Stan. Truth or dare?

282
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,607
Stan, truth or dare?

283
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:53,163
- Dare... - Son could you please
come help me with the firewood?

284
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,816
Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday.
We have enough to last 12 years!

285
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,587
When will you let me in?
Let me love you?

286
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:02,679
- Now get your ass out here
and help me. - Bye Stan.

287
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,367
- Hopefully we can play truth
or dare tomorrow! - Crap!

288
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:08,572
I think you should be able to
move out legally when you're 14.

289
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,473
Our moms won't even let us smoke.

290
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:14,343
Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives
me shit for smoking, but it's my body,

291
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:16,044
I should be able to do
whatever I want with it.

292
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:19,210
Totally. My mom gives
me shit sometimes.

293
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:22,011
And I told her to shut her hole
before I kick her in the nuts.

294
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:26,484
Eric! Pookums! It's time for mommy to tuck
you into your snugglebolt for night night!

295
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:31,681
- Eric are you up there in your
clubhouse? - Coooming moom.

296
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,526
- Ok we have to play truth or dare
quick! - Hey girls. What's up?

297
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,638
- Oh hey Scott!
- Who the hell are you?

298
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,641
- Oh we invited some people over. Hope
you don't mind. - How many people?

299
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,485
- Kyle, can I talk to you?
- Ok.

300
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:46,646
Kyle, this is very difficult for me.
I think we need time apart.

301
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,759
I'm just feeling really trapped,
I can't go on with this co-dependency.

302
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:53,357
- Ok, that's fine... - No no. Don't
speak. Just try and understand.

303
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,682
- It has to be this way.
- But I don't care.

304
00:17:55,807 --> 00:18:00,039
Please, just remember the good times
we had. I'll never forget you. Never.

305
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,722
- Ok Clyde, we can go now!
- Bitchin'.

306
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:07,441
These are cafe curtains, that require
no sewing and I know you all love that.

307
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,604
Do you mind if I watch cartoons?
I've had a rough day.

308
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:13,399
- What?
- Ehh... chores. Do chores.

309
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,803
- My dad let's me watch cartoons.
- Well I'm not your dad, ok?

310
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:21,318
I'm NOT YOUR DAD!!!! You can't just go
around playing games with my emotions!!!

311
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:25,119
- Stanley? What did you do to Roy?
- Roy's a dick!

312
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,602
He ruined my chances with
Wendy at the clubhouse!

313
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,252
Stanley, you know you're the
most important thing to me right?

314
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,553
If that's true, then get back
together with dad for me!

315
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,930
Now, Stanley you have to
understand how divorce works.

316
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:37,831
When I say you're the most
important thing to me, what I mean is

317
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:41,846
you're the most important thing after me
and my happiness and my new romances.

318
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,481
- Bye now. Roy!
- Divorce is stupid.

319
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,727
Hey hey hey. Hey Alonda, why's
your eye all black and blue and shit?

320
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:55,365
- Man Fat Abbot! My stepdad popped me in
mah eye! - Stepdad! You gotta off his ass!

321
00:18:55,487 --> 00:19:01,881
Yeah bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap.
Leave that nigga swingin from a tree so high,

322
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,682
nobody finds him for days. Clock
Clock, you know what I'm sayin?

323
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:09,925
- Dumbass nigga pullin shit damn!
- Alright Fat Abbot, thanks.

324
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:14,996
No problem hoe. Maybe later you can
suck my nigga dick bitch hoe shit.

325
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:18,358
Well Fat Abbot and the gang sure
did learn something today.

326
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:24,039
If you have a stepdad riding your ass, just snatch
his ass in a bear trap. Grind! No more stepdad.

327
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:29,764
- See you next time eating the pudding.
- Yeah I think I'll write a little note for Roy.

328
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,122
Hey kid give me some of those!

329
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:41,841
- Hey when are we gonna play truth
or dare? - What? That game's for kids.

330
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:46,085
- This is bullcrap! - Oh boy it's gettin
late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.

331
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:48,846
This sucks Kenny. I wish we'd
never built a clubhouse.

332
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,923
Mash pit!

333
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:58,157
Oh my god! They killed Kenny!

334
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:01,760
You bastards!

335
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:06,360
Stanley? Your father's coming
over for visitations. Stan?

336
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,123
Meet me in the clubhouse.

337
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,957
Sharon, sharon have you
seen my copy of harpers?

338
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,523
Meet me at the clubhouse.

339
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,326
Oh Randy! What are you doing here?

340
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:25,727
I got a note from Stanley to
come out to the clubhouse.

341
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:29,123
- Oh I thought that note was for me.
- Oh maybe it was.

342
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:33,320
Well it looks like our little Stanley has
built himself quite a clubhouse here.

343
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:37,076
I remember not too long ago, we were just
kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.

344
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:41,836
- Good night.
- Sharon?

345
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,719
- Truth or dare?
- It’s too late for games.

346
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:46,566
- No I’m serious. Please.
Truth or dare. - Truth.

347
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,680
- Do you still love me? - Oh Randy,
I do love you. Now I’m so confused.

348
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:55,278
I’m living with Roy, and I don’t
know how to break it off with him.

349
00:20:56,207 --> 00:21:00,883
- Well you never know. Maybe things will
work out. - Maybe. I guess it’s my turn.

350
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:03,680
- Truth or dare.
- Daaareeeh.

351
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,605
Do me. Right here
in the clubhouse!

352
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:13,199
- Hello? Hello? Could somebody come and…
hello? - Wow, clubhouses are magical.

353
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,164
Ok my turn! Stan, truth or dare?

354
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:23,966
Daaareee.

355
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:30,156
Take this stick, and jam
it up your pee hole.

356
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:34,559
- What!!?!?  - Wow, that sucks.
- Do you think it’ll hurt?

357
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:40,279
I sure am hungry.

358
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,917
Anybody?

359
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:47,804
This certainly does suck right here.

360
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:52,678
Hello? Sh.. sh… Sharon?
Sharon, hello?
