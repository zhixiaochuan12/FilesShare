1
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:35,693
- The answer is no, Stanley.

2
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,194
But mom all the guys are going to
Cartman's grandma's for the weekend.

3
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,876
I'm sorry Stanley. I can't let you go
all the way to Nebraska by yourself.

4
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:45,158
- It's the holidays. - But all the other guys get
to go to Cartman's grandma's why can't I?

5
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,323
- I'll leave it up to your father.
- Well, it's fine with me.

6
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,438
The answer is no Stanley!
Now go wash up for supper!

7
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:53,321
- I don't want your lame ass supper.
- Ooh you're gonna get it now.

8
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:55,961
Go to your room Stanley right now!

9
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:59,885
Can' tell me what to do.
I'm eight years old.

10
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,722
I don't need this stupid
family, anyway.

11
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,457
It's so nice of you to take
all the boys with you.

12
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,338
Oh it's all my pleasure.
Eric loves his little friends.

13
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:11,074
Every time I go to my grandma's house,
she gets me a present. You watch.

14
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,005
As soon as I walk in the door
she'll hand me this big present

15
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:15,038
- for no reason except that I'm keww.
- That's nice Cartman.

16
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:19,399
Now remember, if they have leftover turkey,
put some in a bag and bring it home, ok?

17
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:22,003
- Ok, let's go. - Oh, I didn't
think you were coming Stan.

18
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,606
Of course I'm coming.
C'mon let's hurry.

19
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,878
- Goodbye Booby, be careful.
- See you in a couple of days son.

20
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,079
Shotgun. My car,
I call it first. Shotgun.

21
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,159
Kenny I called shotgun.

22
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,641
Dammit Kenny,
get in the back!

23
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:39,123
Hey Kenny there's a sale on
orange jackets over there.

24
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,036
Look Kenny there's
an elephant parade.

25
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,760
Kenny. Kenny look, look.
Go get it.

26
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:48,806
You poor piece of crap.

27
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,921
- So how far is it to Nebraska?
- About six hours.

28
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,022
Oh my god. What the hell are
we gonna do for six hours?

29
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:58,223
Well I've got an idea.
We could sing.

30
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,246
- Ya. Or, we could not. - Let's sing that
one grandma song, ma. How does that go?

31
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:05,518
Over the meadow and through the
woods to grandmother's house we go.

32
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:08,957
The horse knows the way to carry the
sleigh through the white and chilly snow-o.

33
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,643
Please stop.

34
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,156
Please stop.

35
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:24,203
- Ooh careful hon. These roads
are bumpy. - I guess so.

36
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:28,200
Here we go kids. We're crossing
the state line into Nebraska.

37
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:36,599
- This is Nebraska?
- What's all that stuff?

38
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:40,099
Wheat. The building block of your
favorite foods and Nebraska's

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,160
principle source of economic activity.

40
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,920
- You see when Nebraska first became...
- We don't care mom.

41
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:45,760
Hey look!

42
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,961
See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska.

43
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,807
- Wow. We have to go, dude. - Dude I
thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer.

44
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:52,806
What's he doing in Nebraska?

45
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,082
I don't know. Ever since he was
in that movie he got all famous.

46
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh so now everybody wants to meet
Mr. Hankey. He's a piece of crap.

47
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,203
It doesn't matter.
He'll be most excited to see me.

48
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,364
That shouldn't be a problem.
Eric's grandma is right near the mall.

49
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:05,636
- Cool! - How much further
is it to grandma's house?

50
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,037
I want to see what kind
of presents she got me.

51
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:10,358
- About another hour hon. - Why does
grandma have to live so far away?

52
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,492
Why don't we just stick her in
a nursing home closer to us

53
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,793
so I don't have to drive six hours
to get a goddamned present!

54
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:18,800
Now Eric let's try to get out of that grumpy
mood before we get to grandma's.

55
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:23,966
Oh god.

56
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,517
- Here we are.
- Jesus Christ, finally.

57
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,717
Grandma, Grandma,
Grandma, Grandma.

58
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,443
- Oh it's little Eric.
- Hi Grandpa.

59
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,321
- Look at how big you've gotten.
- Hi Eric. Grandma got you a present.

60
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:41,836
- Sweet. What is it?
- It's inside.

61
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,480
Yes! Move it.

62
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,838
- Hello everyone. Happy holidays.
- Hello.

63
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,285
These are Eric's friends,
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.

64
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:52,186
Boys let me introduce you
to the Cartman family.

65
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:55,005
- This is Uncle stinky...
- Nice to have you heyar.

66
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:58,836

Alexandra, Fat Bob, Jimmy,

67
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:04,246
- and Great Grandma Florence. - Come here
Eric. Give your Great Grandma some sugar.

68
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:08,402
- No, no Florence. That's not Eric.
- Oh. Which one is he?

69
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,166
- The fat one. - I'm/He's not
fat I'm/He's big boned.

70
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:14,279
- That was totally gross. She smelled
like vitamins and pee. - Sick dude.

71
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,557
All righty then, let's get to
my presents shall we?

72
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,485
Here you go Eric. Happy holidays.

73
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:24,556
- Wait a minute. This isn't a present. This is a shirt.
- Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.

74
00:04:24,687 --> 00:04:29,283
Are you telling me I drove nine hours through
butt fucking nowhere to get a goddamn shirt!?

75
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,796
Mom grandma's gone senile.
It's time to stick her in a home!

76
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,279
Well this is what the holidays
are about - family.

77
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:40,116
- Ya right. - Well what does your
family do for the holidays, Stan?

78
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,363
My family's dead.

79
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,523
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Stan.

80
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,764
- Dude, your family died? - There dead to me.
My mom doesn't even know I'm here.

81
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,959
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt.
The holidays are bull crap.

82
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:54,796
- Here Kyle. Will you hold great grandmother's
cathoder bag during dinner? - What is it?

83
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,636
- Great Grandma has a bladder problem,
this helps her out. - Sick dude.

84
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,600
Eric, did you say hi to
your little cousin Elvin?

85
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,195
- Hi cousin Elvin.
- Sweet.

86
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:08,559
It is certainly nice we could all gather
'round heyar for the holidays.

87
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:13,238
Even Uncle Howard has joined us live
VIA satellite from the State penitentiary.

88
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,437
- Whoa dude!
- You look good Howard.

89
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,957
- No I don't. - Hi Howard.
- Dude, is he here every year like this?

90
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,957
Sweet.

91
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,606
Come on let's eat already. They
gave me extra bread and water.

92
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,844
Where's your manners Howard?
We haven't even said Grace yet.

93
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,767
Mom will you do the
honors of saying Grace?

94
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:35,568
God dammit why the hell do I
always have to say Grace?

95
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:40,363
If one more person asks me to say Grace
I'll be like - "Hey, I'm not saying Grace",

96
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,365
and if you ask me again I'll
kick you squa' in the noots.

97
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,078
- Amen.
- Amen.

98
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:49,846
Jesus dude.

99
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,203
No Jimmy this is mah potpie.

100
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,435
- No Jimmy that's a bad Jimmy!
- No Jimmy!

101
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,922
No Jimmy that's grandpa's potpie!

102
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,121
No Jimmy that's a bad Jimmy!

103
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,602
- Dude, I don't know how long I can
stay here. - I know what you mean.

104
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:15,090
- What dude? - Dude I was
having this horrible nightmare

105
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,091
that we were at this house and
it was filled with Cartmans.

106
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,642
Kyle we are at a house
filled with Cartmans.

107
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:24,484
- What was that? - I heard it too.
- What ever it is, it's getting closer.

108
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:28,077
- What the hell was that for? - I
wanted to make sure we're not dreaming.

109
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:30,004
- I wanted to make sure too.
- Well you're not dreaming!

110
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,245
- Cut the crap! - Dude,
it's coming through the window.

111
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:39,477
- Uncle Howard! - Oh hey Eric. I
didn't think anybody'd be down here.

112
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,936
- Uncle Howard what are you doing
here? - We thought you were in jail.

113
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:43,237
Ya well I-I busted out.

114
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:46,643
- Wow cool! - We can't let the
rest of the family know I'm here.

115
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:50,965
- Ok. - If it's ok, we're just gonna hang
out here for a couple of days with you kids.

116
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,521
Who's We? You got
a turd in your pocket.

117
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,118
Come on up, it's ok. Another inmate busted
out with me. Don't worry he's a good guy.

118
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,876
Oh hi boys. I'm Charlie,
Charlie Manson.

119
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,313
I can't wait to get out among
the pigs and wreak some hell.

120
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:10,514
Alright Chuck, but we gotta
lay low for a little while.

121
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:13,480
When I stand on the mountain
and say do it, it gets done.

122
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,783
And if it don't get done,
then I'll move on.

123
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,584
And that's the last thing in
the world you want me to do.

124
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,636
- Alright Chuck just watch some TV or
something. - Now back to It's a Wonderful Life.

125
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:28,046
You can't just buy people Mr. Potter. Well
you know what you are; you're a little bitch.

126
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:31,318
That's right you're a bitch and I bet
you would like to suck it, wouldn't ya?

127
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:32,739
Wake up Cartman, we
gotta get to the mall.

128
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,240
We have to go see Mr. Hankey
at the mall Cartman.

129
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:39,081
- Alright keep your pants on.
- Hey, bring us down some food all right?

130
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,481
- C'mon team.
- Can somebody drive us to the mall?

131
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:48,438
Hello? Mr. Hankey is appearing at the
mall, can somebody please take us?

132
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:52,685
- Uncle Stinky can you take us to the mall?
- Not now Eric. Hold him where's the flag?

133
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,560
Uncle Stinky my stupid friends want to
see Mr. Hankey. You have to take us.

134
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,202
I said no and I mean no!
Respect my authoritah!

135
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:02,637
- Damn his goddamn authoritah.
- Only sixteen seconds left in the quarter...

136
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,520
We interrupt this broadcast
for a news bulletin.

137
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:10,198
Mass murderer and extremely nasty person,
Charles Manson has escaped from prison.

138
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,956
Charles Manson was responsible for
seven murders in the late sixties.

139
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,999
Manson has never shown any
signs of remorse for his crimes.

140
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:21,086
If you see Manson please kick his ass
and smash his fuckin' face in for me

141
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,277
and then call the police.
And now back to the game.

142
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:27,559
And they've done it! They've scored sixteen
un-answered points in fifteen seconds!

143
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:32,681
- Ah Weak! - Eric I need you to take
care of your cousin Elvin for a while.

144
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:36,959
- I don't wanna take care of cousin Elvin.
- Won't you do it for Grandma?

145
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,516
Alright give me ten dollars.

146
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:44,797
- Kick ass. - Chuck can you
turn that damn thing down?

147
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,885
Hello movie house,
hello burger parlor!

148
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,735
You know what the spirit of
Christmas is? It's another lie.

149
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,936
From the lying pigs who
consider me the witness...

150
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:55,163
Ok Chuck, thank you very much.

151
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,040
- My family sucks ass. - Ya they do.
- All families suck ass.

152
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,637
- Here we got you some sticky
cinnamon buns. - Wow sweet.

153
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:04,800
- Dude we have to get to the mall.
- You guys seriously.

154
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:05,928
What's the matter?

155
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,529
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to
visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.

156
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,165
- Oh bummer.
- I'll take you.

157
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,165
Uh that's ok Chuck. You just keep
watching Christmas specials.

158
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,041
Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up
in somebody's basement, I want some action.

159
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,880
- Good for you Charlie. - C'mon
I'll hot-wire your grandpa's car.

160
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,664
Do you really think we
should go with this guy?

161
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,665
Stan, don't be such a dumb ass,
you have to trust people.

162
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:28,958
Alright boys keep your heads down.

163
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,238
We're goin' to the mall.

164
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,662
I just can't believe he would
go without our permission.

165
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:40,063
Uh, Sharon don't over-react. Maybe Stan
didn't go to Cartman's grandmother's house.

166
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:44,882
- Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or
something. - I hope for his sake you're right.

167
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,845
Hello Ms. Cartman it's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?

168
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,765
Why yes he did. I thought
you were dead Sharon.

169
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:56,960
- What? - Stanley told me that you had passed
on. I'm glad to see that you're better.

170
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:02,115
- Get the car Randy we're going to
Nebraska. - Ooh. Stan's in trouble.

171
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,042
- Do you see him?
- Not yet. We still have a ways to go.

172
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:11,237
I can't wait to see him. He's
gonna be so glad we came.

173
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,256
I drove all the way from
Montana to see Mr. Hankey.

174
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:16,657
That's nice kid. I knew Mr. Hankey
before he was even famous.

175
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:20,356
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular?
Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.

176
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,863
- Hissa kissa. Kick ass.
- And another thing.

177
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,524
It also says Mr. Hankey is also
appearing at the Crossroads mall.

178
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:29,520
- So? - So how can Mr. Hankey be here
and at another mall at the same time?

179
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:32,445
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magical powers.
He can do whatever he wants.

180
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,196
How would you like to come with me
to a more secluded part of the mall?

181
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:43,562
- I really like that guy. - Well it looks
like you finished your fudgical, Elvin.

182
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,682
Be quiet Elvin.

183
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:52,082
No Elvin Bad Elvin.

184
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,358
No Elvin Bad Elvin.

185
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:08,762
Folks need to understand that I'm terror, I'm
fear, I am- Oh look another Christmas special.

186
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,521
Now back to the Grinchy poo.

187
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:15,322
The Grinchy poo went up the
chimney and stuffed the tree up.

188
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,280
But then he heard a coo
like the cry of a dove.

189
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:21,763
It was little Cindy Lou Poo
who was no more than two.

190
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:25,641
Mr. Hankey why? Why are you
taking our Christmas tree? Why?

191
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:30,045
That old Grinchy poo thought up
a lie and he thought it up quick.

192
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,398
Alright boys you're up next. Welcome
to Mr. Hankey's happy Lolly land.

193
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,926
Oh boy here we go.

194
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,844
Howdy ho boys.

195
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,246
Mr. Hankey?

196
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,882
- Gosh you boys smell like flowers.
- You're not the real Mr. Hankey.

197
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,918
Sure I am. Howdy Ho.

198
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,955
You look a lot bigger than
the last time we saw you.

199
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,056
Well Mr. Hankey has to
grow too you know.

200
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,244
- Howdy Ho. - Do you boys want
your picture with Mr. Hankey?

201
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,927
This is not Mr. Hankey.
This is a fake.

202
00:11:56,527 --> 00:12:00,076
It's ok kids. I'm real.
Howdy ho!

203
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,147
- Howdy ho!
- Why are you people doing this?

204
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,748
Why would you lie like this to children?

205
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:08,960
Look kid. There's Mr. Hankies like me in every
shopping mall. There's no real Mr. Hankey.

206
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,681
- What?! What did you say?!
- Oh boy, he's done it now.

207
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:14,402
Behold. This is your false promise.

208
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,405
- Get him!

209
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:26,040
- You lied to me mother. You said it was
the real Mr. Hankey. - Well yes but...

210
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,806
I will never forget this mother.
I won't forget this ever.

211
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,679
This is revolution!

212
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh oh they're rioting again.

213
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:40,435
And all the Poos down in Pooville
joined hands and they sang,

214
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:46,563
they sang all the same. And he himself,
the Grinchy poo, carved the roast poo.

215
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:51,124
Wow man that's beautiful.
He was evil but now he's good.

216
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,604
- What happened? - Some kid must have
said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again.

217
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,644
Use the tear gas.

218
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:09,716
I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing
but lies and bull crap. - So how was it?

219
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,442
- It was a fake!
- Oh I'm sorry.

220
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,443
Cartman was right. The
holiday season is for idiots.

221
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:14,806
Where did you go Uncle Charlie?

222
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,807
I went to a beauty parlor and
had my tattoo redone. Look.

223
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:20,361
- Oh that's pretty cool.
- Hey where's Kenny?

224
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,205
Oh. He's…around.

225
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,205
- Hey guys. Let's go.
- O, Hi Kenny.

226
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:27,606
Come on I'll buy you kids
an Orange smoothie.

227
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:28,878
- Ahoj, Kenny.
- Come on I'll buy you kids an Orange smoothie.

228
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:29,282
Hey there he is.
There's Charlie Manson.

229
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,243
Run for your lives boys.

230
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,281
Wait…You guys…
Seriously.

231
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,523
Keep your heads down kids.

232
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,758
What the hell is
wrong with you people?

233
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:53,483
I can't believe they would put
a fake Mr. Hankey in the mall.

234
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,484
If Mr. Hankey ever found
out he would be so pissed.

235
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,167
We interrupt this program
for a breaking news story.

236
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:01,501
A high-speed car chase is happening
right now on Interstate three.

237
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:03,802
We go now to our live
sky five helicopter.

238
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,925
It looks as though the chase is
proceeding west down the interstate.

239
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,123
Oh that looks a lot
like your car, Harold.

240
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,903
We understand that Charles
Manson is inside the car

241
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:14,504
ith several hostages all
of whom are children.

242
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,678
My god what is this
world coming to?

243
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,789
We'd like to take a moment to tell you
this car chase is being brought to you

244
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,790
by Snacky Smores. Creamy fun of smores
in a delightful cookie crunch.

245
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,099
They're gaining on us.

246
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,364
Fudgesicle!

247
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,837
- Kick ass.
- God, I hate the holiday season.

248
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:46,405
- Oh hello kids. Having fun?
- Get in the house! - Alrighty then.

249
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,045
- Lock the door!
- Oh my god, it's Charlie Manson!

250
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,635
- What's going on? - There's a bunch
of policemen chasing after us.

251
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,359
Quiet down, we're
watching television.

252
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:58,878
- Oh Philip what a festive season. - That's
right Terrance this is a season for sharing.

253
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:03,780
- The cops are here! - Howard!
- How did you get out son?

254
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:08,041
Alright Manson we know you're in there.
Come out peacefully and we'll shoot you.

255
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,203
- Tell him we won't shoot him.
- Oh ya.

256
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,444
Come out peacefully and
we won't shoot you.

257
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:18,118
- Oh look Police Chief Stevens has
a new haircut. - Get down ma!

258
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,146
Hey man. Don't point a
gun at your own mother.

259
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:22,647
What's wrong with you Manson?
You're acting all funny.

260
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:26,003
Everybody just sit down and shut up.
We're not goin' back to the big house.

261
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:29,324
Well Howard you've done it again.
You've ruined Christmas.

262
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:32,018
This is Robert Rouner reporting
live from Nebraska

263
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,719
where escaped convict Charlie Manson
has walled himself up in a house.

264
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,964
We understand that there are hostages
and that the situation is critical.

265
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,977
So we would like to remind you
all that this live hostage crisis

266
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,778
is being brought to you
by Palmoral Sun Block.

267
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,321
Remember, if it isn't Palmoral
you're gonna get cancer.

268
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,567
- What's going on here?
- We've got a critical situation ma'am.

269
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:51,095
Charlie Manson is holding
everybody inside hostage.

270
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,896
- Is this the Cartman
residents? - Yes ma'am.

271
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,885
Give me that!
STANLEY THIS IS YOUR MOTHER!

272
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:00,336
- What's your mom doing here dude?
-YOUNG MAN I HAVE HAD IT.

273
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:02,337
YOU HAVE DISOBEYED
ME FOR THE LAST TIME.

274
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,399
- Wow, she's really pissed.
- I'm glad I'm not you right now kid.

275
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,757
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
FOR YOURSELF STANLEY?

276
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,446
Sorry.

277
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,056
Still more developments in
the Manson hostage crisis.

278
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:17,080
It appears now that eight-year-old
Stan Marsh is in big, big trouble.

279
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,358
He apparently disobeyed his parents
and left home without telling them.

280
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:23,445
And, uh, Tom, His mother is
very disappointed with him.

281
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,276
- Dammit. What are we gonna do?
- I'm watching television.

282
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:46,525
- Come out with your hands up. - Dammit dad
why didn't you put a back door on this house?

283
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:51,118
Well there's that old window in the back room.
You could probably squeeze through thyar.

284
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:54,080
That's it! We're going out through the
bathroom window. Come on Manson.

285
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,482
- But I gotta see what happens.
- Come on, dammit!

286
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,287
Well it was good seeing you all.

287
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,888
Don't move until we're gone or I'll
shoot you dead. Happy Holidays.

288
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,838
Happy Holidays!

289
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:10,117
- Dude, they're gonna kill me. - Alright
Manson this is it. We're coming in after you.

290
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,126
There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed and
a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

291
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:17,045
You've got till one hundred
marshmallow to come out.

292
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:20,799
One marshmallow,
two marshmallow...

293
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,679
three...

294
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,560
- Alright it's open. Let's go.
- Excuse me. I wanna go with you.

295
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:29,602
- Please I don't wanna go back with them.
- Stan, your mother and father are out there.

296
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,111
I know they've come to punish me.

297
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,312
I'll they want to do is make me pay for
coming to Nebraska in the first place.

298
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:38,197
- Alright kid you can come. Now let's go.
- Stan I want to talk to you about your family.

299
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,125
- What?
- You see I had a family once.

300
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:46,480
At least I called them my family. Really they
were a gang of people I thought were my friends.

301
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,998
After we killed a bunch of people
together I realized my real family

302
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:54,119
was who took care of me, who took
the time to care about what I did.

303
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,309
But they don't care about me.
They just want to punish me.

304
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,810
If they don't care about you would they
have driven nine hours to Nebraska?

305
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,521
I guess you're right
Uncle Charlie. Thanx

306
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,439
- Now can we go?
- No, Howard you go ahead.

307
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,717
- I've got something to say.
- Ah weak.

308
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:13,654
Folks I apologize for this whole mess.
I'm goin' to surrender.

309
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:15,155
Somebody show the
police a white flag.

310
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,041
Ninety Marshmallow,
ninety-one marshmallow.

311
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,603
Do we really have to do marshmallow?
Ninety-two marshmallow.

312
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:28,121
Look out he has a white flag!

313
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,566
Oh my god they killed the
little orange coat kid!

314
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,067
You bastard!

315
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:41,002
- They're surrendering!
- You under arrest.

316
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,079
Alright you. You spread 'em.

317
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,722
- You're going back to prison to rot
Manson. - Good. I deserve it.

318
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,839
- What? - I can never make it up
to the families that I destroyed.

319
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,642
But at least I'll make an example for anyone
else who thinks that crime is an answer.

320
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,758
- Stop that.
- You see I get it now,

321
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,355
I finally understand
what the holidays are all about.

322
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:02,960
Boys, don't you see, you can't let
things get you down during the holidays

323
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:05,661
because being happy are what
the holidays are all about.

324
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,117
Charlie's right. I'm not gonna let some
fake Mr. Hanker ruin my holidays.

325
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:14,941
I've been such a bastard all these years
and I finally understand it-it feels great.

326
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:18,281
I-I feel like-I feel like I'm in
my own Christmas special.

327
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,925
Holidays are that special time when we
laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy.

328
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:28,598
Forget about being
angry for a day.

329
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:35,942
Remember how it felt to be a child,
opening presents on Christmas mornin',

330
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:40,604
that's the way we
should all feel now.

331
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:46,040
So I say - Happy, happy, happy,
happy, holly, happy, happy, holidays!

332
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:52,161
Happy, happy, happy, happy,
holly, happy, happy, holidays!

333
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:55,165
Happy Kwanza too.

334
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:58,996
From me to you.

335
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,685
- Happy holidays you guys.
- Happy holidays Bob.

336
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:05,526
- Happy Holidays Chief.
- C'mon Manson. You belong in jail.

337
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:10,163
- Darn right I do. - Well I guess I'll be going
mom and dad, but I hope you can forgive me.

338
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:14,917
Oh of course we forgive you son. It was
nice of you to drop in for the holidays.

339
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:20,280
- Yes now watch that ass in prison son.
- I always do. See ya, thanks for all your help.

340
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:23,205
See ya Uncle Howard. Thanks for
being such a great role model for me.

341
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,966
- Piece of crap!
- I hope you can forgive me too mom.

342
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:30,157
Oh Stanley, let's just forget the whole
thing and have a nice holiday back home.

343
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:30,858
Really?

344
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:34,721
- Sure. We'll punish you after the
holidays. - Hooray! I mean hey, what?

345
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:39,363
And so Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in
his cell and everything is back to normal.

346
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:43,400
And I guess the only thing left to
say is - God bless us everyone.

347
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:50,320
And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry
for what I've did, but that doesn't make up for it.

348
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:55,123
I deserve to be in jail. I'll I hope is that I
don't make mankind lose faith in itself.

349
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,445
Yes there's murders in the world, and rapists,
and thieves. But those are the vast minority.

350
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:04,038
The majority of mankind is made up of caring people
who try everyday to do what they think is right,

351
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,284
and that's the spirit of the season.

352
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,638
- What do you think guys?
- It sucks just like all your other books.

353
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:17,038
- Well, goodnight you guys
happy holidays. - Shut up!

354
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,966
What was that?

355
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:24,804
- What the…
- Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!

356
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:29,284
Hark the herald angels sing,

357
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:33,764
"Glory to the newborn king

358
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:38,165
Peace on earth and mercy mild,

359
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:42,360
God and sinner reconciled

360
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:46,844
Joyful all ye nations rise,

361
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:51,279
join the triumph of the skies

362
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:55,639
Hark the herald angels sing."

363
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,837
This is pretty fucked up right here.
