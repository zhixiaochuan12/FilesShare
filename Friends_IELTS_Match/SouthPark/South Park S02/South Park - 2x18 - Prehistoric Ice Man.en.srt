1
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:37,403
As we steer out boats, looking
for these dangerous predators.

2
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:44,160
There's a king croc right there. He must
be 4 meters. 12, 13 feet long at least.

3
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:48,246
This croc has enough power in his
jaws to rip my head right off. - Oh no!

4
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,804
I've got to be careful.

5
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:52,995
So what I'm gonna do is sneak up on
him and jam my thumb in his butthole.

6
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,126
Holy crap, dude! - If I get bit out here,
I'm 200 km from the nearest hospital.

7
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:00,762
I better be real careful jamming
my thumb in his butthole.

8
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:04,759
- Oh boy he's pissed of now!
- Go dude go!

9
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:09,881
I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole
now. This should really piss him off.

10
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:13,443
Oh yeah that pissed him off alright!
I've got to be careful!

11
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,319
This guy rules!

12
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,723
- I told you guys.
- Well, that was quite an angry croc,

13
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:22,601
but I managed to escape with only a few
bruises and a shattered left testicle.

14
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:25,309
Next week, we'll look for more
of these beautiful creatures

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,010
so we can learn more about them
by pissing them off in their sleep.

16
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:31,126
- Thanks for watching.
- Dude, let's go look for crocodiles!

17
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:38,164
There's bound to be some crocs out here. I'll
use my croc-call and try and bring them in.

18
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:42,920
That's not how a croc
sounds you fatass penis!

19
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:46,960
Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the
bean-bag and see what happens, boy crocky

20
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:48,998
- Get away from me, Cartman!
- Come here, crocky.

21
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,802
- Dude!
- Help!

22
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,647
Good job Cartman! You
killed Kyle! - You bastard!

23
00:01:58,767 --> 00:01:59,824
Well he shouldn't
called me fat.

24
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,925
Why the hell not?! That's
like calling the sky blue!

25
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:05,044
Well screw him, he's dead! Let's
go look for crocodiles. - You guys!

26
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,283
Hey, he's still alive.
Kyle, are you okay?

27
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,763
- I think so. I Cartman out
there? - I'm right here, Kyle.

28
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:14,386
Cartman, you fuckin hunk of fat
rat fuckin hunk of pig fuckin ass fat!

29
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:16,787
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Say
that to my face, pussy!

30
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,957
- Can you climb back up, dude?
- I don't think so.

31
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:23,205
Dammit! I guess I'll have to go get him. - No,
come on you guys, let's go look for crocodiles.

32
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,600
Whoa, dude!
This is making me sick!

33
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:31,843
- Sick dude!
- Sorry!

34
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,845
- What the hell are you doing,
fat boy?! - Screw you, hippie!

35
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,305
Come on dude!
I wanna get out of here.

36
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:39,306
Alright, just grab the rope.
Wait a minute. What's this?

37
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,763
Dude! It's a dude!

38
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:50,766
- He's like some frozen guy! - Come
on you guys, it's getting cold up myah!

39
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,923
Shut up Cartman!
Dude, I saw this in a movie once.

40
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,224
The old cavemen get frozen,

41
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:57,225
and then people discover them and make
them their caveman friend. - Wow! Cool!

42
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:01,161
You guys, there's a frozen ape man from
the past down here! Send some more rope!

43
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,677
- Really! Hey, there's a frozen guy down
there! - Help me chip some of the ice away.

44
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:09,039
Hey you guys! This was just like
that one movie, um, Jon Travolta...

45
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,402
and that French chick were
doing it all summer long,

46
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,903
and they went back to school and
sang songs about grease lightning.

47
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,440
You know, the movie is Sandra
Dee checking out Prissy

48
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,591
and the Italian chick gets
an abortion but she...

49
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:24,646
Cartman will you shut the hell up and get
some more rope! - Screw you guys anyway!

50
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,700
Hey remember when that kid found
a wallet and he get a reward?

51
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:29,301
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get
a reward for the frozen guy!

52
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,717
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

53
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:37,818
Where should we bring it?

54
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,919
I don't know. We just have to get it to town
and then let them figure out what to do with it.

55
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,606
- I think I'm gonna name it Gorak.
- No dude, we have to name it Steve.

56
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:47,037
Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name
is Steve? - It's my name. And I found him!

57
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,522
- You didn't find him. I found him.
- What are you talking about dude?

58
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,600
I fell down that
abyss and there it was.

59
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,101
You wouldn't have even noticed
it if I hadn't pointed it out.

60
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:56,159
Kenny, who found the ice man? - - Yeah,
I think you ought to name him Steve.

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
I think we're almost
there you guys.

62
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,761
Alright people, the next order of
business is a very serious matter.

63
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:06,766
We need to vote on whether South Park
should reinstate the death penalty or not.

64
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,526
- All those in favor say yippie!
- Yippie!

65
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,081
Wait what was that?
I missed the question. Yippie!

66
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,721
- All those opposed say nay!
- Nay!

67
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,236
- Screw you!
- Hey! Screw you!

68
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,005
Hi! Excuse me!

69
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:23,245
Not now, kids! The town is having a very
important debate on capital punishment!

70
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,920
But we found a frozen
ice man from the past!

71
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:29,791
I found this frozen guy
in the woods today.

72
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,792
No! I found this frozen
guy in the woods today!

73
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,447
- What the hell is going on here?!
- We came for our reward.

74
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,206
- Yeah, like a kid with a wallet.
- Reward? What reward?

75
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:39,784
Mayor, I think the boys may have
stumbled on to something here.

76
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,085
You see mayor, frozen links are often
found, dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths.

77
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:47,280
This specimen could be a missing link in
our evolution. If I could unfreeze the body,

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,006
and perform an autopsy, I could learn much
about this creature's people and it's time.

79
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,846
- Sure sure sure, be my guest,
knock your socks off! - Thank you mayor.

80
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:56,604
Oh! And boys, I can't give you a
reward for finding this creature,

81
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,405
but if you'd like,
I'll let you name him.

82
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,199
- Really?
- Sweet! How 'bout Steve?

83
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,363
- Steve it is. - Wait a
minute! His name is Gorak!

84
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,717
Come on, Steve,
we've got work to do.

85
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,001
Unfreezing this body will
be quite delicate work.

86
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,902
We'll have to use the most
advanced methods available.

87
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,649
This is very exciting!
He could be a Neanderthal,

88
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,650
or an australapithocus
from the paleolithic era.

89
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:23,085
Do you see that Kevin? These
clothes are from Eddie Bauer!

90
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:28,884
I haven't seen anybody wear
clothes from Eddie Bauer since 1996.

91
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,481
This is incredible! Think of all we can
learn from this body! All that it teach us!

92
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,723
Let's hope the press doesn't
get wind of this right away.

93
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:40,324
Stand back people,
there's nothing to see here.

94
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:44,201
- What about the prehistoric ice
man? - Oh yeah, there is that.

95
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,803
Dr. Mephesto, could you please
tell us what's going on?

96
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,704
Ladies and gentlemen, we
still have a lot of work to do.

97
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:54,604
But it is my opinion that this man has
been frozen in time for over 32 months.

98
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:57,825
Yes it's true, although
at this early stage

99
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:00,526
we know very little about this man
or the time from which he comes.

100
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,618
Fascinating news
tonight from South Park!

101
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:05,819
An ancient discovery of a
prehistoric man actually frozen in ice!

102
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,872
A team of scientists continues
to try and unfreeze the body

103
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:10,973
so that it can be
autopsied and studied.

104
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,716
The caveman was discovered by
Kyle Brovlofsky, who had this to say:

105
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:20,046
Well, I fell down this ice cavern
and I saw this block of ice...

106
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:24,160
The prehistoric ice man is thought to be
from the late neo-post-Jurassic era,

107
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,494
where he was probably a part
of a hunting and gathering

108
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,995
tribe that lived on
Waterston street.

109
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,717
That's it Kevin!
We can begin the autopsy.

110
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:36,281
What's this?!

111
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:40,559
- Holy crap! He's alive?! - That's
impossible! Do an EKG on him.

112
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:44,566
- My God he really is alive! The ice must've
preserved him. - Well, quick, do something!

113
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,177
No no! We've got to
think this through!

114
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,528
Mayor, this man has not been
conscious for almost three years!

115
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:51,289
He won't understand what he sees!
He'll be frightened and confused!

116
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,990
Well, you can't just let him die!

117
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:56,164
Perhaps death is better than the shock
he will take trying to adapt to our time.

118
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,843
- Oh my goodness! It looks as if he's
about to speak! - Where... where am I?

119
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,480
- What? - What's he
saying? - Is that English?

120
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:06,246
- What? You're hungry?
- Where am I?

121
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,562
- You're hungry?
- What's going on?

122
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:14,603
Me friend... friend.
Me friend... Mephesto.

123
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,400
Me-phes-to.

124
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:20,200
If we could understand what he's saying,
then maybe we could get some answers.

125
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:22,797
If only there was someone who could
communicate with him on a level

126
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:25,498
as primitive as his own.
A mind like a child.

127
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,161
- Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
- Gorak's a gay name.

128
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,005
- No it isn't!
- Why you being such a dick?

129
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,561
I'm not being a dick,
you're being a dick!

130
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,554
Hello children. Dr. Mephesto
needs one of you

131
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,255
to help him out in his lab
with the prehistoric ice man.

132
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,119
- I'll go!
- No I'll go! I found him!

133
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:43,035
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this.
- Alright, there's only one fair way to do this.

134
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,317
Everyone stick out their potatoes.

135
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:48,250
My mother and your mother
were out hanging clothes.

136
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:52,523
My mother punched your mother in
the nose. What color blood came out?

137
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,196
B-L-O-O... uh... O spells blue...

138
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:59,683
and that means that you will go
to the lab and help out Mephesto,

139
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,844
and then we could all go
home and watch Murphy Brown.

140
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:06,966
- Steve! You!
- Where am I?

141
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,363
Steve, Steve.

142
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:16,443
- Oh good, your here.
- Oh my God! They revived Gorak!

143
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,206
You bastards! - Yes, and I need
you to communicate with him.

144
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,795
See if you can understand
what he's saying.

145
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:23,758
- Uh, hi!
- Hi.

146
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,366
- What'd he say?
- He said hi.

147
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,284
- Very interesting.
- Where am I? - What?

148
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:30,843
- He wants to know where he is.
- Tell him... tell him he's home.

149
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,798
You're home.

150
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,441
- In the year 1999.
- It's 1999?!

151
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,764
- He's been frozen for the past 32 months.
- Dude, you've been frozen for 32 months.

152
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:41,606
- And we found you...
- What?! 32 months?!

153
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,718
Alright alright! Calm down.
I think that's enough for today.

154
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,119
Good job, dude,
you freaked him out!

155
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:47,881
Shut up assmaster! You're just jealous
that they had me talk to him!

156
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:52,239
Guess what! You're not my best friend
anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!

157
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,577
Oh yeah! Well you're not my
best friend anymore either!

158
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:57,286
Cartman in now my best
friend! - Killer! - Fine!

159
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,443
- Fine!
- Fine!

160
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,035
- Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
- The same.

161
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,612
We understand that
you are currently in

162
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,913
possession of the
prehistoric ice man from 1996?

163
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,760
- That's right.
- We would like to...

164
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:19,399
We would like to offer our services in your
experiments. - Where are you gents from?

165
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:25,457
From the University... of America. - Well,
there's not a lot to see, but come on in.

166
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:29,272
He's still not responding much
to us. The shock is still settling in,

167
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,873
but we've made great progress
now that he's in the habitat.

168
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:35,124
- Habitat? - Yes, Kevin and I
designed a habitat for Steve to live

169
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:39,001
in that is completely like his own world.
Everything is 1996 oriented.

170
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,680
Amazing! He looks
so much like us!

171
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:50,765
Yes! Well Kevin has done a lot of
work in figuring out how related to us

172
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:53,966
Steve really is. He came
up with this drawing.

173
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:57,279
Dr. Mephesto, we realize that
scientific study is expensive.

174
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:01,400
- We wanna help you make this project
more lucrative. - How would we do that?

175
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,006
It's easy.

176
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:15,121
As you can see, the ice man
is listening to Ace of Bass,

177
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,788
which was a very popular
group during his era.

178
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:19,889
Their primite drumming
soothes people's tempers.

179
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,963
- He doesn't look very happy in there.
- No, he sure doesn't.

180
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,972
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe!
I was talking to Cartman!

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,173
Well I was talking
to Cartman too!

182
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,118
Oh! I'm pretty friggen
cool all of a sudden.

183
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:31,035
Here we see the ice man trying to
gain internet access on the computer.

184
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:35,763
The internet was not very big at his time,
so the web frightens and confuses him.

185
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,850
It's okay! He can't hurt
you! It's one-way glass.

186
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:43,051
He can't even see us. And now,
the ice man watches television.

187
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,637
This grizzly bear has the strength
of over ten Morgan Freemans.

188
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,884
- I'm really pissing him off right now
- Wait! This could be dangerous.

189
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,645
- How so?
- He's changing the channel.

190
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,235
Something on the television
could frighten and confuse him.

191
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:58,326
And they've done it! The Atlanta
Falcons are going to the Superbowl!

192
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,644
What?!

193
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,555
- You guys aren't being very nice
to my creature. - He's my creature!

194
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:11,236
He's fine boys, and we're learning so much
from him. - Let him out dude, he's scared.

195
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:14,803
He would be more scared on the outside.
You think this stuff freaks him out?

196
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,316
How would you think he'd react to what's
happening in the government right now?

197
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:18,501
But it isn't right!

198
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:22,502
Little boy, sometimes what's right
isn't as important as what's profitable.

199
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:36,359
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

200
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,482
What?! I'm not talking to you.

201
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,086
Gorak?

202
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:52,517
- Gorak, are you there?
- Oh hi! What are you doing here?

203
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,190
Viewing hours are 10 to 18.

204
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,091
I don't think it's fair for them to
keep you captive like this, Gorak.

205
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,557
- I came to bust you out. - Wow!
That's really nice of you kid! Thanks!

206
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:04,165
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to bust out Steve!

207
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:07,040
- What? You can't! I'm here to
bust out Gorak! - His name is Steve!

208
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,839
- His name is Gorak!
- My name is Larry.

209
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,480
- Steve!
- Gorak!

210
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,199
What kind of stupid-ass
name is Steve?

211
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:16,036
Because he kind of looks like Steve
Austen, the Six Million Dollar Man!

212
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:18,645
- No he doesn't!
- Does so!

213
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,804
Uh, hey kids, could you just open the
door so I could get back to my family.

214
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:24,157
- I found him! I'm rescuing
him! - Thanks!

215
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:25,686
- You're a dick!
- You're a dick!

216
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,401
You're a dick, and I've had it
with your dicketry! I choose you!

217
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,978
You wanna fight?!
That's fine with me!

218
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,679
Tomorrow afternoon at
the bus stop! 4 o'clock!

219
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,844
- Why don't we make it 3 o'clock?!
- Dude, Terrence and Phillip's on at 3?

220
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,357
- Fine! I'll kick your ass tomorrow,
dick! - I'll kick your ass so bad...

221
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:44,436
you'll wish you never had it to
begin with! Your ass I mean... wait.

222
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:08,800
- He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
- No, that's impossible! How could he have?!

223
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:12,158
- He must have used this door.
- Dammit! Dammit!

224
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:14,881
We have to find him! He won't
survive long out in the world.

225
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,386
Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be
able to use him for our military war...

226
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:20,486
- Right! - What?!
- What? - Nothing.

227
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,360
No! What did you say?
Use him for what?

228
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:28,005
- Dr. Mephesto, where could the
creature have gone? - I have no idea!

229
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:32,518
We'll never track him down on our own.
This calls for some special assistance.

230
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,917
- Can I help you?
- Leslie, it's me, Larry.

231
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:44,756
- Your husband.
- Husband? You're not my husband.

232
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:48,562
Think hard Leslie! We used to be
together for over eight years.

233
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:55,040
I seem to remember a husband, but I think
he was lost and never found on Kanosha pass.

234
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,123
That was me!

235
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,203
Who is it, lover?

236
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,560
It's my former husband
who I forgotten all about.

237
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,691
Well sir, let me shake your hand.
I'm proud to meet the man

238
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,992
who's wife I'm currently
sticking it to every night.

239
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:17,805
- So you remarried?
- Yes, Laurie...

240
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,406
- Larry.
- Larry.

241
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:24,157
Larry, you disappeared! I waited for
you to come home for over three days!

242
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:26,840
I remember how cold
and lonely the nights got.

243
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:30,241
By the fourth day I
knew I had to move on.

244
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,218
Didn't anybody send out
a search party for me?

245
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:37,239
We did Larry! We looked all afternoon!
But we found nothing, no trace.

246
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,643
Please! Leslie, I don't know
where else to go! I'm confused!

247
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,042
- Leslie, I'm with Buck now.
- You're Leslie!

248
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,079
Right. I'm with Buck now.
We have children together.

249
00:14:46,207 --> 00:14:50,519
Calvin is eight, and little Buck is
thirteen. I can't just up and leave them!

250
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,645
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

251
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,997
I'll leave you alone.

252
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,803
Eight and thirteen?!

253
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,157
Well, I don't see any crocs out
myah... - Dammit, Cartman!

254
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,212
You're supposed to be helping
me get ready to fight Kyle,

255
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,913
not playing
Australian Outback Guy.

256
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:09,961
Oh, now I'm gonna let this jaguar butt
me in the face and see if it hurts.

257
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:12,760
Come on jaguar,
let's see what you got...

258
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,560
- Ah, sonofabitch! - You suck
as a best friend, Cartman!

259
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:17,721
You sonofabitch cat!

260
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,281
- What are you doing, Gorak?
- I can't live in your time.

261
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,558
- I'm freezing myself again.
- Whoa, that sucks, dude.

262
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,348
Tell me about it! I've been doing this
for three and a half hours now,

263
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:31,949
and only my toes are
starting to ice over.

264
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:33,896
Steve! Wait! - What
are you doing here, dick?

265
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,597
We're not supposed
to fight until 4 o'clock.

266
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:39,885
- I've got something to show Steve, dick.
- Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick.

267
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,919
- Steve, you don't have to freeze
yourself, look. - What is that?

268
00:15:43,047 --> 00:15:45,959
It's this place called Des Moines.
It's like lost in time, see.

269
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,435
Everybody looks like you do.
Fashion is two years behind.

270
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,322
Technology is two years behind. Fads
are two years behind. Just like you.

271
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,963
- Home! - Come on, Steve,
you're going to Des Moines!

272
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:02,875
Oh no you don't glory-monger! Gorak is my
responsibility! I'll take him to Des Moines!

273
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,475
No you won't, butthole!

274
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:09,162
- They're coming for me!
- Come on!

275
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:13,200
These jaguars can be real mean.
I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.

276
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,602
- Was the ice man here?
- He might've been, boy crocky.

277
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:19,561
- We have to get him back.
Well, can you do it? - Sure I can!

278
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,680
- I can hunt down anything!
- Wow! Kick ass!

279
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:30,322
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines
please. - Des Moines? What the hell for?

280
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,438
- We have to get our friend
Steve... - My friend Gorak...

281
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,305
To Des Moines or else
he's gonna melt away.

282
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:37,106
No! He's not gonna melt away!
That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!

283
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,683
- Frosty, Steve, whatever.
- Well, okay. I'll find him a seat.

284
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,255
Dude! Look, it's 4 o'clock.

285
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,456
Oh, we'll wait for you over there,
Steve. We have to start fighting now.

286
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,637
Okay, boys. Thanks!

287
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:51,157
- Okay, first one to die loses.
- Okay.

288
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:53,323
- Okay.
- Okay.

289
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,961
- So here we go.
- Okay.

290
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,446
Go!

291
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:08,682
Wait a second!

292
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,956
- I think he came through here recently.
- Yeah, I think the same thing.

293
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:17,576
Well where the hell is he?! We
gotta get him back to the lab.

294
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,277
He can't function
out here in our time!

295
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:22,837
- Calm down! Calm down! - Yeah! Calm
down! Calm down! You sons of bitches!

296
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,162
- Wait! Look!
- Is it him?

297
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,840
No! It's a Rocky
Mountain rattlesnake.

298
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:31,241
This is the most poisonous
snake in this entire region.

299
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:36,600
So what I'm gonna do is carefully sneak up
on it, and jam my thumb in it's butthole.

300
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:42,518
Cracky! This snake is really pissed! Well I'm
gonna jam my thumb in it's butthole now.

301
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:46,765
- Oh yeah, that pissed it off alright!
- Does he always do this? - Yeah.

302
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,959
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in
something's butthole now.

303
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:58,283
- Watch my toes, dude!
- I got my ticket.

304
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:02,764
- I have to go to platform B.
- Oh! Okay, it's over this way.

305
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:12,444
The trail ends here. - The train station?
Then he's trying to go somewhere.

306
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,037
Have you seen a man who looks similar to us,
but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?

307
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,443
- What the hell are you talking about?
- An ice man, a man from the past.

308
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,001
We must find him!
Now where is he?!

309
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:27,202
Well this is it. I'm going back
to my time. Thanks again boys.

310
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,078
- No problem, Gorak.
- Later.

311
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,844
You boys have shown me the
true meaning of friendship.

312
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,945
You didn't care about
anything but my happiness.

313
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:40,326
You put me in front of yourselves, and
that's what real friendship is all about.

314
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:44,565
After being frozen, I've learned that all
a person has in life is family and friends.

315
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,688
If you lose those,
you have nothing.

316
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,889
So friends are to be treasured more
than anything else in the world.

317
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,600
- Right on.
- Cool.

318
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:54,764
Good bye, boys!
Good bye, friends!

319
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:59,286
Where is he?
Where's Steve?

320
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:03,241
- His name is Gorak!
- His name is Steve!

321
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,835
- The train!
- We've got to stop it!

322
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,844
No worry!

323
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,356
- Let's get him!
- No!

324
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:15,081
- We've gotta stop that train!
- Come back here, you.

325
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,286
- Steve! Steve! Look out!
- They're after you!

326
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,521
Oh, he's a wiley one.

327
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,444
- Oh poo!
- Steve! Look out!

328
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:30,996
Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric
man, a sure sign the prey is frightened.

329
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,961
As well as he should be as I will
now jam my thumb in his butthole.

330
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,920
- Stop the train!
- Hey, who are you?

331
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:41,562
- I said stop the train!
- Yes, hello! I see you.

332
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:45,157
They're all moving pretty fast, but
I'll catch up to them, boy crocky.

333
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:50,842
- I got you pinned. I win.
- Now I've got you pinned. I win.

334
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,804
Hey! It's okay! The chopper
is here! Go get him boy!

335
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,246
Cut him off!

336
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,326
Now for the coup de gras.
I'll just get my thumb in there.

337
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:16,640
Uh, the train's not stopping!
It's not stopping!

338
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:20,641
Holy butt...

339
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,086
Where's Gorak?

340
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,523
Wow! That is the god
damnedest thing I've ever seen!

341
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,044
- Where's the ice man? - He has
to be around here somewhere!

342
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:38,520
- I can't believe he's gone.
- Wait, look, the helicopter!

343
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:42,117
- Steve! - He's alive! - Goodbye
again! I'm off to Des Moines!

344
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,717
No! Come back! You can't
adapt! You'll never live!

345
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:50,079
I'm not living here! Living in having ups
and downs and sharing them with friends!

346
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:54,079
Thank you Stan
and Kyle! See ya!

347
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,404
Well, so much for our plan to use
the ice man to take over Sweden.

348
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,846
- What?!
- What? Nothing.

349
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,442
Kyle, Steve is a pretty
good name for that guy.

350
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:03,543
No, dude, Gorak is cool,
because it's original.

351
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,200
And besides you found him.

352
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:10,805
Be very, very quiet.
I'm hunting crocodiles.

353
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,760
Can we be best friends again? I
hate having Cartman as a best friend.

354
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,355
- Me too, he sucks!
- Oh yeah!?

355
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:19,638
Well I don't need you guys
anyway! You guys can kiss my...

356
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,962
There's a king croc
right there!

357
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:27,366
And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna
sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in it...

358
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,685
Hey! Hey get me out
of here! Goddam it!

359
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:35,475
It smells like Kenny's
house in here!
