00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,616

And now, mr. Mackey will read his
favorite psalm for us, psalm 46.

25
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,450
Uh, god is our refuge
and strength, m'kay.

26
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,768
A very present help
in trouble, m'kay.

27
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,304
Hey, you guys, you know what
my favorite psalm is?

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,004
"It's a man's obligation

29
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,739
"To stick his boneration
in a woman's separation

30
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,377
This sort of penetration will increase
the population of the younger generation."

31
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,563
God is in the midst of her,
m'kay.

32
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,714
She shall
not be moved, m'kay.

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,016
Wait, wait, wait!

34
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,150
"It's a man's obligation to stick
his boneration in the woman's-

35
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,353
"It's a man's obligation to stick
his boneration in a woman's separation

36
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,089
To increase the population
of the younger generation."

37
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:31,257
"Mrph rm rmph rmhrmh
rmhr rmhph rm rmhpr-

38
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,957
No, no, no,
"separation".

39
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,294
"It's a man's obligation to stick
his boneration in a woman's-M"

40
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,029
Boys, you are
in church!

41
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:37,330
Ah!

42
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,149
The god of jacob
is our refuge, m'kay.

43
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,661
Thank you, mr. Mackey,
hello, everyone.

44
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,138
Today, we are going
to talk about...

45
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,439
Hell!

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,343
Hell is not
a very nice place.

47
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,477
Burning, searing,
flames,

48
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,947
Screaming, torture...
for eternity!

49
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,585
Once you are in hell,
you cannot escape.

50
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,320
You live forever
in horrible pain.

51
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,020
In burning agony!

52
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,790
All sinners
are there in misery,

53
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,525
Dying over
and over and over!

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,995
If you be cast down into
this black bog of stench

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,695
Then woe is thou!

56
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,766
For satan has made it the most
miserable place in the universe!

57
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,037
And he will be
your ruler!

58
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,238
Your ruler
of pain and agony!

59
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,973
? Are we going
to the hukilau?

60
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,044
? The huki huki huki

63
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,418

I do!

65
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,322
? Where the lau lau is
the kau kau at the luau?

66
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,725

Thanks for coming,
oh, bye, marsha!

84
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,169
Satan, a few of us are gonna go
pound some brews, you wanna join us?

85
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,338
Oh i'd love to,
mr. Matthau, but i can't.

86
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,507
Chris and i just moved
to the west side

87
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,808
And we have to unpack.

88
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,543
Oh well, maybe next time,
great luau!

89
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:31,844
Bye!

90
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,617
Chris?
Yeah?

91
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,087
Did you, uh, see my "boy
with an umbrella" hummell?

92
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:46,159
Uh, no, but there's still some
boxes coming from the movers.

93
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,859
Oh, okay, thanks.

94
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,846
Oh, that must be them now.

95
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,798
Just put the boxes
by the-

96
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,400
Hello, satan!

97
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,968
Saddam!

98
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,304
Did you miss me,
buttercup?

99
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,341
No, it can't be,
you're dead.

100
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,607
I killed you.

101
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,908
Yeah,
you killed me, so?

102
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,112
Where was i gonna go,
detroit?

103
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:09,148
Oh no,
oh god, no!

104
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,150
A place of everlasting
agony and pain!

105
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,186
Hell awaits all sinners and
all who do not accept christ!

106
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,691
Children in this town have not been
attending sunday school after mass.

107
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,294
And adults have not been
coming to confession.

108
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,428
If this does not change,
i promise you,

109
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,933
You will all be going to the
black pit of satan's world!

110
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:30,403
That is all,
peace be with you.

111
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,090
Well, that was quite
an uplifting sermon. Yeah.

112
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,441
Mom, we're staying
what? For sunday school.

113
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,211
We have to go to sunday school
so we don't burn!

114
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,477
Yeah, i'll see ya
later, mom!

115
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,898
Oh, now look at that,
they're scared to death!

116
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,249
Hell is a very real place,
mr. And mrs. Marsh!

117
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm trying to save their souls and
the souls of everyone in this town

118
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,621
From the wretched
lake of fire!

119
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,490
Come on, guy!

120
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,826
Just let me in
so we can talk.

121
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,960
I don't want to
talk to you, saddam!

122
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,164
This isn't what i need
in my life right now!

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,430
Is that
the movers, satan?

124
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,033
Uh, yeah, yeah,
it's just the movers.

125
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,237
Oh, well, tell them i'm leaving
their check on the counter.

126
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:05,937
Okay, chris.

127
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,707
Satan, look, i know our
relationship wasn't perfect.

128
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,442
Okay?
I know that.

129
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,478
I was too busy trying to take over
the world, to give you what you needed!

130
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,178
But i've changed, satan.

131
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,913
Oh, like i haven't heard
thatbefore.

132
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,985
Come on, can't we just
go out for a burrito?

133
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,119
Me gusto burrito mucho.

134
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,190
I can't, saddam,
i'm with chris now.

135
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,491
Who?
Screw him!

136
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,625
He can't pound your ass
like i can!

137
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,794
Goodbye, saddam.
Wait, wait, i'm sorry!

138
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,998
But satan, you can't deny
what's between us.

139
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,264
You can try,

140
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,999
But you know
we belong together.

141
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,637
My life is good now, saddam,
chris treats me well.

142
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:39,372
You and i are through.

143
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,673
Goodbye.

144
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,481
Hey, come on, guy!
Give me a break!

145
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,651
Hello, children,
i'm sister anne,

146
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,289
And i'll be teaching you, so that you
all can receive your first communion!

147
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:57,590
Are we gonna
go to hell?

148
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,290
Well, hopefully not.

149
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,025
That's why you're gonna
need to receive communion.

150
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,795
And as long as we get this
communion thing, we're safe?

151
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,964
What if we haven't really done
anything that horribly bad in our lives?

152
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,664
Yeah, whatif
we hadn't?

153
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,736
It doesn't matter, because we
are all born with original sin.

154
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,436
Now let me explain
how communion works.

155
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,206
The priest will give you
this round cracker,

156
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,507
And he will say,

157
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,110
"The body of christ"
and then you eat it.

158
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,712
Jesus was made
no. Of crackers?

159
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,013
But crackers
are his body.

160
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,531
Yes.

161
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,581
What?

162
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,219
In the book of mark, jesus
distributed bread and said,

163
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:27,485
"Eat this,
for it is my body."

164
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,689
So we won't go to hell,
as long as we eat crackers?

165
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,955
No, no, no, no!

166
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,725
Well, what are
we eatin' then?

167
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,859
The body of christ!

168
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,846
Oh, i get it, jesus wanted
us to eat him,

169
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,763
But he didn't want us
to be cannibals

170
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,967
So he turned himself into crackers
and then told people to eat 'im.

171
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,233
No!
No?

172
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,003
I can't whistle
if i eat too many crackers.

173
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,606
Look, all you have to know is that
when the priest gives you the cracker

174
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,040
You eat it, okay?

175
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,208
Okay.
Okay.

176
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,811
And then you will drink
a very small amount of wine.

177
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,511
For that is
the blood of christ.

178
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,715
Oh, come on now,
this is just getting silly!

179
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,016
Eric, do you want
to go to hell?

180
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,150
No!
Questioning me!

181
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,354
But now we can have communion
and not go to hell, right?

182
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:03,757
No, because before you can
take your first communion,

183
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,043
You have to have your first
confession. Confession!

184
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:08,294
You'll be getting in the
confession box with a priest

185
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,295
And confessing all your sins,
so that god can forgive you.

186
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,933
You kids will all have to go to
your first confession this tuesday.

187
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,199
So i want you all
to go home tonight,

188
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,186
And think long and hard
about all your sins,

189
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,138
So that you can tell
the priesteverything.

190
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,476
Oh, sh-!

191
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,247
Those were some
great pork chops, satan!

192
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,514
Yeah.

193
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,284
Hey you, you've been
acting strange all night.

194
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,984
What's up?
Nothing, why.

195
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,055
Well, it's just that you've washed
that same dish seven times now, silly.

196
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,623
Oh, sorry,
heh-Heh.

197
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,827
Come on, satan, you know
you can tell me anything.

198
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:41,694
What's up?

199
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,032
Well, chris,
saddam showed up today.

200
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,732
Oh...

201
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,803
Wow, i wasn't ready
for that.

202
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,406
He showed up spouting
all kinds of things

203
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:55,575
About how he's changed
and he still loves me.

204
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,310
I thought you...
killed him.

205
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,479
Yeah, well, where was
he gonna go, detroit?

206
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,214
Do you still love him?

207
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,480
No, chris.

208
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,649
It's okay if you do.
Well, i mean...

209
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,286
Of course there's a part of me
that will always love him.

210
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,323
But i also know
how abusive he was.

211
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:11,624
I'm much happier
with you.

212
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,324
You know what
i think we should do?

213
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,528
I think we should all get
together and just talk like adults.

214
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:16,794
What?

215
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,998
We're all grown men here, satan,
i wanna just go meet this guy.

216
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,034
No, chris, you don't understand,
saddam is ing crazy.

217
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,203
I know he's got the whole
"bad boy" thing going.

218
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,372
I think that's what
you were attracted to.

219
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,107
But i can be a pretty
rough tumbler myself.

220
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,577
Oops!
Aw, butternuts!

221
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,216
Okay, let's see...

222
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,385
Oh yeah, there was the time we threw
a fish into the bus driver's hair

223
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,953
And she didn't find it for
seven days. Oh yeah, okay.

224
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,723
And then there was the time we
held that little first-Grader down

225
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,457
And farted on him
for 28 minutes.

226
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,676
Right, i already
got that one.

227
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:47,825
Hey dudes,
what are you doing?

228
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,327
We're trying to remember
all our sins.

229
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,663
Sister anne told us we have
to confess all our sins

230
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,964
Or else we're gonna
what? Go to hell!

231
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,098
Have you confessed
no! All your sins yet?

232
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,868
Dude, he's jewish, he doesn't
have to confess his sins.

233
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,134
Oh good, i don't?

234
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,037
No, you're already
going to hell.

235
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,737
I am not!
You are too!

236
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,472
Dude, this lady told us that
if you don't confess your sins

237
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,242
And you don't eat crackers and drink
wine, then you go to hell, period!

238
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,977
I'm gonna go
ask my mom!

239
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,244
Now let's see...

240
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,580
What about the time we set
mr. Garrison's cat on fire?

241
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,182
Oh right, that was mostly
kenny's fault. What?

242
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,351
You guys, you guys! We just
thought of somethin'!

243
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,618
What, butters?

244
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,821
Well, what about
the handicapped kid, timmy?

245
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:16,689
Timmy!

246
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:17,955
What'd we do
to timmy?

247
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,124
No, i mean poor timmy's
gonna go to hell!

248
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,328
He can't confess his sins 'cause
all he can say is his name!

249
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,629
Timmy!

250
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,798
Ooh, yeah, you're right,
i guess timmy's pretty screwed.

251
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,533
Oh man, we can't let
timmy go to hell!

252
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,136
We have to do something!
What are we gonna do?

253
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,305
I don't know, i don't know
whatwe're gonna do.

254
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,607
I don't knowwhat
i'm gonna do.

255
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,776
I can't deny my feelings
for saddam,

256
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,414
But my life is so much
better now with chris.

257
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,981
Ee-Aa-Ee-Aa
be-Ya-Ki-Ki-Ki!

258
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,486
Yeah, it's like chris is
so perfect in every way,

259
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,655
But there's just something
about saddam

260
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,624
That i'm much more
attracted to.

261
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,559
Eee-Aaa-Beecha-
Eee-Aa-Beaa!

262
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,259
In what way?

263
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,029
Eee-Aa-Beeea-
Beachaaa!

264
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,296
Yeah, you're right.

265
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,499
Saddamwouldjust
treat me bad again!

266
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,633
I just have to
not see saddam,

267
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,705
Put him out of my mind
and focus on chris.

268
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,405
If i don'tseesaddam,

269
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,609
Then won't have such
strong feelings for him.

270
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:10,476
Thanks guys!

271
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,742
Goycha!

272
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,277
There you are!
Oh, hi chris!

273
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,779
I've been looking
all over for you.

274
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,549
I have to tell you something
that might make you...

275
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:19,116
A little mad.
What?

276
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,622
Well, i called saddam hussein and
invited him over for dinner tonight.

277
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:23,888
You what?!

278
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,658
I just think we all need
to get this out in the open.

279
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,260
Aw, chris, aaaghgh!

280
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,527
Aaghgh!

281
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,514
Come on, satan,
we're all adults here.

282
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,466
He was an important person
in your life,

283
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,068
For better or for worse,
so i want to know him.

284
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,768
If he sees that i'm
a real person too,

285
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,406
Then maybe he'll see
how happy we are together.

286
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,809
No, chris, he'll try to
kill you is what he'll do!

287
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:45,177
Satan, we're not in
junior high school anymore.

288
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,346
Oh dear god!

289
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,250
Hail mary, full of grace the lord
is with you, blessed art thou among-

290
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,118
How was it?

291
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,818
Oh dude,
you screwed me up! Huh?

292
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,588
The guy in there said
i have to say 54 "hail marys".

293
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,323
Now i can't remember if
i was on number 7 or 8!

294
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,589
Who's in there?
I don't know.

295
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,925
You can't see him,
it's just some anonymous guy.

296
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,094
Well, here goes
everything!

297
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,564
Uh, forgive me, father,
for i have sinned.

298
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,698
Blessed art thou, child.

299
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,468
Now, what do you
have to confess?

300
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,735
Well, let's see...

301
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,938
I'd like to start, if i may,
back when i was two and a half.

302
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,674
It was a cold, april morning
and the dew on the grass

303
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,807
Was frozen like
tiny beads of glass.

304
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,577
Hail mary, full of grace the lord is with thee
- Hey, dude.

305
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,879
God dammit!
What?

306
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,048
Ooh, there's sister anne, come
on we gotta ask her about timmy!

307
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,583
Sister anne!
Oh, hello, children.

308
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:25,049
We have a question.
Okay, shoot.

309
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,218
Where do handicapped people
go when they die?

310
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,289
The handicapped are just people like
you and me, so the same rules apply.

311
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,158
They need to be baptized, take
communion and confess their sins.

312
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,362
But our friend timmy can't really
talk, all he can do is say his own name,

313
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,964
So he can't really confess his
sins, so is he going to go to hell?

314
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,231
Uh...

315
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,868
This really isn't a question
for me, it's for the priest.

316
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,603
I'll see if
i can find him, bye!

317
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,206
And that was about everything
from first grade,

318
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,906
Then last year, well...

319
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,110
You can't tell anybody
about this stuff, right?

320
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:54,146
Your confession does not
leave this box.

321
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,846
Okay, because last year,

322
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,050
I took a sandwich that the priest
of this church had been eating.

323
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,184
Oh, well...

324
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,954
I'm sure he would
forgive you,

325
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,689
If he knew.

326
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:04,955
Yeah, but i'm not
finished yet.

327
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,691
I took a sandwich
that the preist was eating,

328
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,328
Took the piece of ham out of it,
put it between my butt cheeks,

329
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,497
Then put the sandwich back
and watched him eat it.

330
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,197
I see.

331
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,835
Yeah, and then this other time, i
went pee-Pee in the holy water thing

332
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,003
And the priest blessed himself
on the forehead with it

333
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,270
Every day for
about a week.

334
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,040
And then one time,
i was at the park

335
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,992
And the priest was out
walking his dog,

336
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:24,510
And i went number two
on the sidewalk

337
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,112
And then told officer barbrady
that it was the priest's dog,

338
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,281
And so the priest got fined
like $100 for not cleaning it up.

339
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,981
And then this one time,

340
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,318
I put super glue
all over the priest's bible-

341
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,354
Ah, ah, oh, jesus,
aaghgh!

342
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,889
Aaghh! Aaagh!

343
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,355
Ah, ah, help!

344
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,091
Father, i need
to talk to you.

345
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,861
Father, i have to
ask you a question.

346
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,596
Okay, okay, fine.

347
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,198
Oh, oh!

348
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,933
Dude, what happened?

349
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,200
I felt it, you guys!

350
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,403
I felt
the angry hands of god!

351
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,537
He is an angry god,
you guys.

352
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,609
We all have to start
taking this very seriously!

353
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,681
Oh, hello,
you must be saddam hussein.

354
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,815
And you must be
mr. Ass face!

355
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,585
Just kidding,
you're chris, right?

356
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,320
Thanks for inviting me
to dinner, guy.

357
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,622
Here, i brought you
a potato.

358
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,322
Oh, thank you!

359
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,057
Chris, no,
it's a bomb!

360
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,961
Satan, what the heck
is wrong with you?

361
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,394
Yeah, hey, relax, guy!

362
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,165
We're all here
to act like adults, right?

363
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,166
Oh, gee, i must have
overcooked it.

364
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,370
Well, come on in,
dinner's just about ready.

365
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,009
"And behin da glass
der dusty fowny eye."

366
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,275
Very good, ike!

367
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,479
That's two john steinbeck
books in one day!

368
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,780
Cookie monster!

369
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,515
Oh, he's growing up
so fast!

370
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,334
Mom, dad,
am i going to hell?

371
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:41,195
Why, what did
you do, kyle?

372
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,987
Nothing,
but the guys said

373
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,757
If i don't confess
my sins and eat crackers,

374
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:45,825
I'm gonna go to hell!

375
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,576
Oh, no,
that's just catholics.

376
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,094
Us jews don't
believe in hell.

377
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:49,962
We don't?

378
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,662
But what
if we're wrong?

379
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,733
Well, kyle, they could
be wrong, too.

380
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,902
Yeah, but if they're wrong,
no big deal.

381
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,637
If we're wrong,
we burn in hell!

382
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,904
Oh no!

383
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,072
Kyle, it's all about being
a good personnow.

384
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,710
You see, christians use hell
as a way to scare people

385
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,410
Into believing
what they believe.

386
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,048
But to believe in something, just
because you're afraid of the consequences

387
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,748
If youdon'tbelieve
in something

388
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,518
Is no reason
to believe in something.

389
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,218
Understand?
No.

390
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,554
Well, you guys can
do what you want.

391
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,157
I'm going down to that church to
confess my sins and eat crackers.

392
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,759
And i'm taking
kyle! Ike with me!

393
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,062
So, saddam,

394
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,700
Satan told me all about how you
guys almost took over the world once.

395
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,400
Yeah, those were
the days, boy.

396
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,170
What the hell is this crap
we're eating, anyway?

397
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,304
It's all vegetarian,
saddam,

398
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,507
Chris was a nutritionist
before he died.

399
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,208
Oh, isn't that
fascinating?

400
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,411
So tell me, chris,
how was it that you died?

401
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,448
Oh, well, i actually slipped
down an escalator in a mall.

402
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,183
Those things can be
pretty sketchy.

403
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,449
An escalator?

404
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,184
What kind of pussy way
of dying is that?

405
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,822
Look, saddam, i know that you
and satan had a relationship.

406
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,991
And i just want
youto know,

407
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,426
That i'm totally okay with you
guys staying friends. Uh-Huh.

408
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,931
I think it's important to stay friends
with people you had relationships with.

409
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,967
And i know that satan and my
relationship is strong enough

410
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,702
That it can handle
anything.

411
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,671
Right?

412
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,606
Right!

413
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,378
Father, the children asked me
about their handicapped friend.

414
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,511
I want to explain to them
that he's fine.

415
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,149
Well, has your friend ever
confessed or been baptized?

416
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,468
I don't think so.

417
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:19,752
Then hell awaits him.

418
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,354
Father, these boys are really worried
because they think they have to-

419
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,054
They should be worried.

420
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,126
Boys, it is your christian dutyto
save the souls of your friends.

421
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,427
Yes, but-

422
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:29,260
Mr. Father!

423
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,561
We have to
ask you something!

424
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,296
Oh, you're the little
jewish boy, right?

425
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,066
Yeah, if we're jewish,
are we gonna go to hell?

426
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,801
Well, young man,
you can rest assured

427
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,501
That according to
matthew 25,

428
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,705
When you die, you will
stand before god and he will say

429
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,308
"Depart from me, ye cursed,
into the eternal fire

430
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,043
Prepared for the devil
and his angels."

431
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,645
Yes, as a jew, your home
will be the lake of fire.

432
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,747
Oh no!

433
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:48,814
Father!

434
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,417
I hope to see all of you
in church this sunday!

435
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,117
We will be!
We will be!

436
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,188
Father, i don't know if i agree
fully with what you're saying.

437
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,357
I think that as long as
jewish people are good,

438
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,057
They will
get into heaven.

439
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,827
Sister, the jews
crucified our savior.

440
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,430
I'm mean, if you don't go
to hell for crucifying a savior,

441
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,563
Then what the hell
doyou go to hell for?

442
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,201
Stan, you've got to help us
become good christians, please!

443
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,901
Alright, alright, alright,
you heard the priest,

444
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,539
The first thing we have to do is
get you guys all baptized, come on!

445
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:14,840
Wagh-Blagh-Aggh!

446
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,841
Wagh-Ha-Hagh-Blagh!

447
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,611
Okay, you better baptize
kyle some more.

448
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,312
Hallelujah,
wash away the sin! Agh!

449
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,082
Turn around so i can
clean out your ass!

450
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,348
Cartman!
What?

451
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,118
Dude, you said "ass",
that's a sin!

452
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,870
Oh, now you've
said it too!

453
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,553
Oh, sh-, agh!
F- , whoops!

454
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,323
Oh, dude, we gotta get back to
the church and confess again!

455
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,142
But what about them?
Uh, oh, i know!

456
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,528
We can use
"wacky water weasel"!

457
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,565
Agh!

458
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,300
Okay, come on!

459
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,566
Timmy!

460
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,553
Well, i don't know
about you guys,

461
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,470
But all that ginger
made me tired!

462
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,240
Yeah, i guess i should
be getting back.

463
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,541
Good,
i'll show you out.

464
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,109
Nice to meet you, saddam,
have a safe walk back!

465
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,313
Yeah, thanks for the wheatgrass
and twigs and stuff!

466
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,915
Satan, that guy
is a pussy!

467
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,049
He's stable, saddam!

468
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,784
Yeah, that's what i said,
he's a pussy!

469
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,289
Having stability in your life is
a great thing, you should try it!

470
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,458
For some people, maybe,
but you like excitement.

471
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,760
I know you, satan.

472
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,495
I'm very happy
with my life now.

473
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:10,761
Here.

474
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,399
I'm at the bargain hotel
on mala vista, room 16.

475
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:15,532
No, saddam,
i won't be needing this.

476
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,170
I know you won't, but just
keep it just in case.

477
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,339
It was good seeing you
again, satan, goodnight.

478
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,508
Goodnight, pussy,
i mean, chris!

479
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,809
G'nite!

480
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,713
Hello, your excellency.

481
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,448
This is sister anne,
the bleeding eyes of jesus,

482
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,714
Calling from
the united states.

483
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,918
Yes, i understand you wish
to speak-A with the pope.

484
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:35,087
Yes, the priest here has been
telling the children

485
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,787
Some pretty
radical things,

486
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,557
And i just wanted to see
what the church thinks

487
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,257
About jews and
the mentally handicapped.

488
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,895
Yes, well, the pope is here,
but please keep it brief,

489
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,630
He is-A very old-A.

490
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,330
Huh?

491
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,631
Hello, his holiness.

492
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,835
I want to ask you about people
with mental disabilities.

493
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,702
Huh?

494
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,739
Do mentally challenged people
go to hell?

495
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,306
Huh?

496
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,510
Handicap,
mental handicap.

497
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,210
Brdrdrbrdrdrdrdr.

498
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,017
The priest here said that people with
mental handicaps might end up in hell,

499
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,283
Is that true?

500
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,788
Uhhhhhhh...
bdrdrdrdrdrdrr.

501
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,126
Come on, this stupid light
won't change.

502
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,427
Come on, hurry up!

503
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,162
Hey, what are
you guys doing?

504
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,765
We're going to church, we sinned
and so we have to confess again!

505
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,934
Us, too, we saw a picture
of a naked lady.

506
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:23,634
We could see
her whole beaver!

507
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,705
Yeah, if we died right now, we'd have
unclean souls and we'd burn in hell!

508
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,175
Well come on,
let's go!

509
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,213
Oh my god!
They killed kenny!

510
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,983
He had sins that
he didn't confess!

511
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,718
And he never
took communion!

512
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,984
He'sdoomed.

513
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,622

514
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,923

515
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,225
Careful.

516
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,262
Yeah.

517
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,598
That's hot.

518
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,900
You take it.

519
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,600
You take it, now.

520
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,936
Chris,

521
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,203
I'm just...

522
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,406
I'm just trying to be
a little more naughty in bed.

523
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,592
I know that's what you liked
about sex with saddam,

524
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:05,744
I'm just showing you that
i can be that way too.

525
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,846
Oh boy.

526
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:07,913
Uh-Huh.

527
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,082
Yeah, you like that,
don't you, bitch?

528
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:12,268
I'm a bad boy.

529
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:14,384
Yeah,

530
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,456
Chris, just don't,
don't do that.

531
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,722
But it turns you on.

532
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,492
When saddam did it,
yeah, but...

533
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,192
But what?

534
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,830
Nothing, i just...
i'm just really tired is all.

535
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:26,964
Can we just please
go to sleep?

536
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,168
Chris, seriously,
i'm just tired, okay.

537
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,336
Okay,

538
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,071
I love you too, saddam.

539
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,338
Wah!

540
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,507
Ah, i'm sorry,

541
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:40,012
It's okay, it's okay,

542
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,747
I understand,

543
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,916
I just need to go
get some air, okay.

544
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,651
I'll be back
really quick.

545
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,620
Yeah, sure, okay.

546
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,472
Come on, hurry up!

547
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,255
Oh no,

548
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,458
What, no, it can't be locked
we have to confess!

549
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,592
We have to confess our sins
before we die!

550
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,796
Hey, there's a window in
the back that's usually open!

551
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,134
The confession box
is over there!

552
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:03,435
I'm first, i'm first!

553
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,701
Ooh!

554
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,038
What the-

555
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,677
Oh, son of a bitch!

556
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,544
He-He-He!

557
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,279
Uh, kids, uh...

558
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,979
You're a sinner!

559
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,183
You're doing unnatural things
in the house of god!

560
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,449
Oh, uh...

561
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,087
Oh forgive me,
heavenly father!

562
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,256
I have sinned
against you!

563
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,956
Oh, this guy is
sogonna burn!

564
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,027
Mrs. Donovan is
a temptress from hell!

565
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,847
Dude, if this guy's going
to hell, who's gonna save us?

566
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:34,198
Well, it looks like we're
gonna have to save timmy, kyle

567
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,703
And everyone else in this town from
the angry hand of god ourselves!

568
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,836
Oh the pain!

569
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,908
Ohh, the paaaiin!

570
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,414
No, i can't.

571
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:53,752
What am i doing?

572
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,921
I know this is
the wrong thing to do.

573
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,222
I could lose chris.

574
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,825
I can't do this,
i can't do this!

575
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,729
We have repeatedly broken
god's commandments-A!

576
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,331
We have lived our lives
for ourselves-A,

577
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,899
Totally ignoring
the lord-A!

578
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,669
"If thy hand offend thee,
cut it off:

579
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:11,935
It is much better
for thee-

580
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,139
Oh, what the hell
are they doing now?

581
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,405
Oh no!

582
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,609
Into the fire that will
never be quenched!"

583
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,875
Pamphlet?
Pamphlet?

584
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,611
There is only one answer!

585
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,682
As kids we must abandon this
town of sin and start anew!

586
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,417
I don't want to
go to hell.

587
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,551
It will be a long road,

588
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,188
But at the end of that road
is salvation!

589
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,225
Andiam going to
lead you there!
