14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,702
Dude, did you do all
your homework last night?

15
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,237
Yeah, but there was
so much of it,

16
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,738
I was up until
two in the morning.

17
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,040
I know.

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,292
Okay, children, i hope you all
did your homework last night

19
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,112
Because we're going to
talk about pages 42 through 612.

20
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,379
First of all,
who can tell me

21
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,582
What year the founding fathers
got together?

22
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,317
Let's see, how about...

23
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,788
Please don't call me,
please don't call on me.

24
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:55,655
Wendy.
Whew!

25
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,921
1776.

26
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,559
Good job, wendy, and what
was that document called?

27
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,162
Oh, please god, don't
let him call on me.

28
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:03,029
Father in
heaven i beg you.

29
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,295
Kyle.

30
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,848
Oh, thank you lord,
praise jesus!

31
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:07,367
The declaration
of independence.

32
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,633
Very good, kyle.

33
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,620
Now, who can tell me
what famous person

34
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,572
Wrote the declaration
of independence?

35
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:13,838
Let's see...

36
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,777
Oh, i know, how about
the new student, timmy.

37
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,044
Timmy!

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,814
No, it wasn't you, timmy,
try again.

39
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,947
Hee-Yah...!

40
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,517
Timmy, did you not
do your homework?

41
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,550
Timmy!

42
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,320
Ah, mr. Garrison,
haven't you figured it out?

43
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,586
Timmy's retarded.

44
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,356
Don't call
people names, stanley.

45
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,623
But he is.

46
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,660
Now, timmy, you need to
work on your study skills.

47
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:34,659
Duh...

48
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:35,960
Are you mocking me?

49
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,730
Because if you are, i have no
problem sending your butt

50
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,266
To the
principal's office.

51
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,767
Liv-A-Laa...
liv-A-La timmar!

52
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,033
That does it!

53
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,237
Well, timmy, i just don't
know what to do with you.

54
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,538
You're getting
very poor marks in school,

55
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,141
And the teachers are complaining
you aren't paying attention.

56
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,442
Ah.

57
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,045
Young man, if you don't
want to be held back a grade,

58
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,214
I suggest you start
cooperating, m'kay.

59
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,914
Timmy!

60
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,551
Well, that does it,
i'm suspending you, timmy,

61
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,119
Until you can learn
to respect your elders.

62
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,889
Hold on there just a second,
principal victoria.

63
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:05,925
I think i may know
what the problem is.

64
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,192
Timmy.

65
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,528
Yes, of course.

66
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:09,360
What?

67
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,096
I think maybe timmy
is suffering from

68
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,299
Something called
"attention deficit disorder"

69
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,566
Or a.D.D.

70
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,336
It's very common
in kids his age.

71
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:18,071
Oh!
Timmy!

72
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,023
Well, that certainly
would explain it.

73
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,667
It's should be
easy enough to find out,

74
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:23,276
They have tests for
that kind of thing now.

75
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,312
Liv-A-Lar
timmy!

76
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,047
All right this is
a very simple test

77
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,314
Which should determine,
without a doubt

78
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,518
Whether or not timmy has
attention deficit disorder.

79
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,784
Good.
M'kay.

80
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,554
Now, timmy, i'm going to
read you a book called

81
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:36,688
"The great gatsby"
by f. Scott fitzgerald,

82
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,458
At the end of the novel,
i'll ask you a few questions,

83
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:39,325
Are you ready?

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,592
Him-My!

85
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,327
Okay, here we go.

86
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,929
"In my younger and more
vulnerable years,

87
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,302
"My father gave me some advice that i've
been turning over in my mind ever since...

88
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,242
"So, we beat on,
boats against the current,

89
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,279
Born back ceaselessly
into the past."

90
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,280
Ah-Ahhh.

91
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,484
Okay, now timmy, can you
tell me, in chapter seven,

92
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,821
What kind of car
did gatsby drive?

93
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:09,854
Timmy!

94
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,389
Well, that settles it!

95
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,027
This young man definitely has
attention deficit disorder.

96
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,293
Oh-Oh, i knew it.

97
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,594
What can we do
for him, doctor?

98
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,798
Well, a.D.D. Is
fairly common in kids today,

99
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,099
I'm going to prescribe
someritalin.

100
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,834
And we'll see how that
goes for little timmy.

101
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,570
Timmy...

102
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,137
Hurry up children,
let's take our seats.

103
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,907
You better have done
your homework last night, timmy.

104
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,209
What's this?

105
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:30,041
Timmy.

106
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,342
A note
from the principal.

107
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,546
"Please excuse timmy from all
questions and all homework,

108
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,715
As he has been diagnosed with
attention deficit disorder."

109
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,981
Oh, brother!

110
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,884
He doesn't have to
do homework?

111
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,584
That's just swell, timmy.

112
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,354
Looks like you've outsmarted the
principal and the counselor.

113
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,620
Timmy.

114
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,922
Very well, i guess you're
excused from homework.

115
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,559
Hey wait, i think maybe i have
attention defunction disorder.

116
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,860
Yeah, me too,
i've got a.D.D.

117
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,994
Me too.
I've got it. Me too!

118
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,066
"After a while i went out
and left the hospital

119
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:56,970
And walked back to the
hotel in the rain."

120
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:06,079
All right now, in chapter 12, what kind
of bottles did ms. Van campen talk about?

121
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,265
Anybody?

122
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,381
Anybody?

123
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,585
My god, these children
all have a.D.D.

124
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,886
Hooray.
Hooray. Hooray.

125
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,055
Hooray.

126
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,658
It's ritalin
for all of you!

127
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:29,901
Dude, we suck.

128
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,888
Hey that's not
the right attitude, jonesy.

129
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,966
The battle of the bands
is tomorrow night.

130
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,009
Dude, we'd never win the
battle of the bands.

131
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,327
There's no big deal.

132
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:38,576
Not a big deal!

133
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,912
This year's winner gets
to open for phil collins

134
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,648
At lollapaloobooza and
that's no big deal.

135
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,816
Hey guys, you better
stop fighting.

136
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,551
We just got to
practice more.

137
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,154
Dude, we've been practicing
for eight years, skylar.

138
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,323
Hey, am i the leader
of this band or not?

139
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,925
Now, let's
do it from the top.

140
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,131
Tim-Mah!

141
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,035
Tim-Mah!

142
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,420
What was that?

143
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:05,938
I don't know, man.

144
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,013
Whoa!

145
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,915
Who is that?

146
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,615
Timmy!

147
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,385
Are you a
singer, man?

148
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,688
La-La-Timmy.

149
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,627
Timmy!

150
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,097
Timmy!

151
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,398
Dude, that's hot!

152
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,700
Yeah.

153
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,868
There's your prescription ms. Mccormick,

154
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,170
$100 worth of ritalin.

155
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,772
Then he won't have attention
deficit disorder anymore?

156
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:40,640
We can only hope so.

157
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:41,941
Next!

158
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,242
Oh, hi sheila.

159
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,279
Sharon, your son has attention
deficit disorder, too?

160
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,881
Yes, i should have known,
it all makes sense now.

161
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,148
I could never get stanley
to pay attention

162
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,568
When his grandfather told
him stories about the '30s.

163
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,954
I know what you mean,
kyle gets so hyper sometimes

164
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,123
He runs around and screams
like a little eight-Year-Old.

165
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,858
I am eight.

166
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:00,124
Next, please.

167
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,461
What do we have here-
Oh, ritalin.

168
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,727
Yes.

169
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,063
That's right i've got
a bad case of a.D.D.

170
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,798
No homework for me.

171
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,401
Mr. Pharmacist, this ritalin doesn't
have any side-Effects does it?

172
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,003
No, your son may experience
a small lack of energy,

173
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,270
But that's all.

174
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,907
And he might start seeing little
christina aguillera monsters

175
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,642
But that's
to be expected.

176
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:17,944
Oh, my!

177
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:23,583
? Would you like to be
laughing in fields of light?

178
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:27,487
? Laughing in fields of light?

179
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,655
Boo!
You suck. Boo!

180
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,223
All right, that was

181
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,294
"Sinisters of mercy, hold no
pain against the dark lord"

182
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,596
With their song

183
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,198
"Spilt blood on the footsteps
of my mind revisited".

184
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,465
We got the best response,

185
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,235
We'll be opening for
phil collins for sure.

186
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,837
And now it's time
for our final band.

187
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,104
Thank god!

188
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,006
Ha ha!
Ha ha! Ha ha!

189
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,272
Give it up for,

190
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,778
"Timmy and
the lords of the underworld".

191
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,983
One, two, three, four!

192
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,453
Timmy!

193
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,357
Timmy!
Yimmy, yeah!

194
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,562
That handicapped
dude, rules!

195
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,262
Yeah.

196
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,900
You guys are terrible, how
can you laugh at that poor kid?

197
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,635
Timmy, timmy!

198
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,539
? The lords of
the underworld?

199
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,443
? Darkness fills
my heart with pain?

200
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:24,544
Timmy, timmy!

201
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,611
Dude, it's timmy.

202
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:26,878
No way!

203
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,179
Da... da... da...

204
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:32,985
They're ridiculing that singer,
come on let's get out of here.

205
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,757
Timmy, timmy.

206
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,926
? And the lords
of the underworld?

207
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,626
Timmy!

208
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,396
? Darkness fills my
heart with pain?

209
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,365
Timmy!

210
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,300
Timmy!

211
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,155
That was awesome!

212
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,639
Yeah, timmy rules!

213
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,276
Boys, you shouldn't laugh
at him he's handicapped.

214
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,144
But, he's funny.

215
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,445
How, would you like
to be handicapped?

216
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,614
Do you think that
would be funny?

217
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,915
You're making
him feel bad.

218
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,217
He looks pretty
happy to me.

219
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,168
Oh, you people
make me sick!

220
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,687
Dude, this is
a no-Brainer!

221
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,821
This year battle
of the bands winner

222
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:15,061
And the band that gets to open for
phil collins at lullapolooza istimmy.

223
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,761
We did it, dude.

224
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,398
Listen to them,
they really love me.

225
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,231
Woo!

226
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,567
Woo! Woo! Woo!

227
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,170
Yes, i'm a rocker!

228
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,208
Tonight we analyze
the new rock sensationtimmy,

229
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,279
The controversial new band
that's taken the country by storm.

230
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,014
Already playing at
several large venues this month.

231
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,050
The band prepares for it's
biggest gig, lollapaloozaza.

232
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,785
Where they will open
for phil collins.

233
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,486
But, phil collins
is not happy.

234
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,956
Well, i think it's a
horrible tragedy, isn't it?

235
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,762
I mean, people aren't going to
see timmy for his musical skills

236
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,028
They're laughing at him.

237
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,534
And i think you shouldn't laugh
at people with disabilities.

238
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,234
Ha, heh-Heh.

239
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,402
Society has to learn
to be more compassionate.

240
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:03,643
This is going to stop,
if i have to stop it myself.

241
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,343
Dude, did you
see that stuff

242
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,644
Phil collins was
saying about timmy?

243
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,282
Yeah, what a dick, timmy's five
times more talented than he is.

244
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,685
Hey, guys, have you been
taking your ritalin?

245
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,018
No we're not actually
going totakethat stuff.

246
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,656
No dude, you got to try it,
it makes you feel good.

247
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,391
Good...

248
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,561
Hello, there children.

249
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,463
Hello, chef.
Hello, chef.O, chef.

250
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,348
Hello, chef.

251
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:26,198
How's it going?

252
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,150
Very well, thank you.

253
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:29,794
Everything's fine, why?

254
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:31,404
Because we're
on ritalin.

255
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,670
What?

256
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,006
We all have
attention deficit disorder

257
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,273
So we all started
taking ritalin.

258
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,127
It really takes the edge off,
man, you should try it.

259
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:40,947
So,that'swhy all you children
are acting so damn boring.

260
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:41,814
That's correct, chef.

261
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,766
Dammit, children,
you don't need drugs

262
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,410
To make you pay
attention in school.

263
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,019
In my day, if we
didn't pay attention

264
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,719
We got a belt
to the bottom.

265
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,272
Now they try to
cure everything with drugs.

266
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:51,756
Yes, but now we don't
have any homework,

267
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,526
So we can go see timmy play
downtown at mile high stadium.

268
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,827
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

269
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,093
Oh, boy.

270
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,430
Oh, it makes me sick!

271
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,032
Those damn psychologists prescribe
all kind of medicine to you children,

272
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,767
Without even caring
about the side-Effects.

273
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,502
But there are no
side-Effects, chef.

274
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,671
No, none at all.

275
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,973
Reoww!

276
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,009
Did you guys see that?

277
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,310
See what?

278
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,312
You're watchingmtv.

279
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,515
The cool brainwashing
12-Year-Old and younger station

280
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,782
That hides behind
a slick image.

281
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,118
We're so cool,
that we decide what's cool.

282
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,419
And nowmtv news.

283
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,588
The news that is single-Handedly
dumbing down our country,

284
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,854
Which is cool.

285
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,624
Here's your host,
kurt loder.

286
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,360
Why am i
still doing this?

287
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:31,263
I've got to be to the oldest person
on this network by at least 40 years.

288
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,964
Kurt loder didn't
just say that.

289
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,167
No wait, he did just say it,
but just to be cool.

290
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,434
That's what
makes him cool.

291
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,505
You think kurt loder is cool
and now the news that's cool.

292
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,541
Well, it's only two weeks
until lollapaloobuba

293
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,843
And the headlining band
has changed,

294
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,228
Now the headlining the event
istimmy,

295
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,089
The new hit sensation
out of colorado.

296
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,915
This news came as a shock
to the performer

297
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,952
That was going to headline
lalapulubla, phil collins.

298
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:55,138
Well, i think the
sad question is,

299
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,289
Where are the parents
in all this?

300
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,760
I mean, that kid's parents is
letting them be exploited

301
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:02,495
And they don't even
seem to care.

302
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,531
And so phil collins
decided to travel to south park

303
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,700
And personally pay
timmy's parents a visit.

304
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:08,966
Well, i mean,

305
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,701
Why are you letting them
do this to your son?

306
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,339
Don't you see that everyone
is just laughing at them.

307
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:14,206
Richard!

308
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,158
Helen!

309
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,642
Hey.

310
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,279
Phil collins warns that a novelty
band that makes fun of the handicapped

311
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,682
Should not be allowed
to play at lollapoolula.

312
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:25,051
And vows to do everything
in his power to stop it.

313
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,653
Phil collins, by the way,
divorced his wife by fax

314
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,622
And then married
a 27-Year-Old.

315
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,125
I'm kurt loder
and that's the news.

316
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,593
Okay, children,
let's settle down.

317
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,799
I mean it,
i want quiet.

318
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,366
My god, mr. Hat,

319
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,101
These children are
so boring on ritalin.

320
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:48,040
All right, children,
today we're going to learn about

321
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,174
Human reproduction!

322
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,510
What do you
think about that?

323
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:56,282
Vaginas and penises...

324
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,884
Butt sex.

325
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,804
Damn it, eric, don't you have
some smart-Ass thing to say?

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,523
What kind of smart-Ass thing
would i say, mr. Garrison?

327
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,657
This is driving me crazy!

328
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,861
I can't handle you little
bastards being so mellow.

329
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,596
Gee, you seem
a little stressed mr. Garrison,

330
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,331
Why don't you
try some ritalin?

331
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,367
Ah...

332
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,970
There you go.

333
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,054
Reow!

334
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:19,670
Ahh!

335
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,657
Thank you, baltimore.
Good night!

336
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,609
Alright, let's
rock this house.

337
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:24,477
Hello miami!

338
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,212
Timmy!

339
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,814
Excuse me, skylar.

340
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,081
Yeah.

341
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,851
Nice to meet you,
i'm phil collins.

342
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,887
Oh, yeah, you're opening
for us at lollapaluzava.

343
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,587
I just want to
tell you well,

344
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,225
That i think you're a great
guitar player and songwriter.

345
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,393
Oh, thanks a lot,
i appreciate that.

346
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,660
Gotta run.

347
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,731
It's too bad those other guys
are holding you back.

348
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,564
Huh?

349
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,299
Well, i mean,
it's obvious

350
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,370
All the talent and artistic
vision in the band comes from you.

351
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,539
Strange how everyone
focuses on timmy, isn't it?

352
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,540
I mean even the name
of the band is timmy.

353
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,612
The name of the band is "timmy
and the lords of the underworld."

354
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,214
Look, i used to be
in a band too, genesis.

355
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,251
But all those bastards did was
hold me back, and hold me back,

356
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,384
But then finally
i went solo.

357
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,022
And that's when i started
writing really great songs.

358
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:12,625
But, look if you you're
happy being on the sidelines,

359
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,227
Being more of a cheerleader
than a player,

360
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,264
Well then i guess you should
stay on as timmy's shadow.

361
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,133
Oh, thanks man,
see you.

362
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:27,373
That should just about put an
end to all this timmy nonsense.

363
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,710
Timmy, timmy, timmy!

364
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,712
Another great show, man.

365
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,915
There must have been
100,000 people out there.

366
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,084
Yeah, all of them
chanting, "timmy, timmy".

367
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:39,917
Timmy!

368
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,218
What's the matter, skylar?

369
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,290
The name of the band is "timmy
and the lords of the underworld",

370
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:45,591
Not just "timmy".

371
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:46,423
Timmy.

372
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,194
And the lords
of the underworld.

373
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,026
Timmy!

374
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,796
It's all about
you, isn't it?

375
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:51,629
I'm sick of it!

376
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,965
Timmy gets all
the applause.

377
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,665
Timmy gets all
the chicks.

378
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,085
Well, you know what,
forget you, man.

379
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,471
But, timmy is what
made our band famous.

380
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,172
Shut up, malsey.

381
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,809
You can stay and deal with
mr. Egomaniac here,

382
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,642
But i'm moving on.

383
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,279
I don't need timmy,
i'm going solo.

384
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,546
Timmy.

385
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,749
No, don't try
and stop me, man.

386
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,918
I'll see you
on fame's backside.

387
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,955
Liba-La!

388
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,425
Hey, terrence, what brand
of pants am i wearing?

389
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,292
Let me see.

390
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,426
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

391
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,196
Let's watch
something else.

392
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,029
Yes, let's.

393
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,582
You're watchingvh-1.

394
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,065
Ah...
ah... ah...

395
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,136
Here's lollapala's news, the
hit group, timmy has broken up.

396
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,872
Oh, dear,
timmy's band broke up.

397
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,439
And so phil collins
is back on as headliner.

398
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,378
The opening band now will be timmy's
guitarist skylar's new solo project,

399
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,679
"Reach for the skylar".

400
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,848
You know something,
i think that's good.

401
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,583
It was wrong to
make timmy a singer.

402
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,885
Yeah, phil collins
was right.

403
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,585
People laughed
at timmy.

404
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,788
And timmy should be at home where
he's protected from laughter.

405
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,055
I agree.

406
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,692
You know what, you guys, we
should go to the concert anyway,

407
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,959
And see phil collins.

408
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,030
Yeah, i think phil collins
rocks the house.

409
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,598
Sounds good,
so it's decided,

410
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,801
Phil collins' concert
for all of us.

411
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,068
Hoo-Ray.

412
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,838
Oh, oh,
hold still kenny.

413
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,175
Oh, my goodness,
you killed kenny.

414
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,911
Bastard.

415
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,044
Parents, i called
all you guys together,

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,814
Because i think you
might be making a mistake

417
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,081
Putting your children
on ritalin.

418
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,250
But, our kids have
attention deficit disorder,

419
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,453
Chef, they can't pay attention
in school without it.

420
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:22,720
I know you want
to help your kids,

421
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,923
But i brought over
a videotape to show you

422
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,892
That there are
alternatives to ritalin.

423
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,792
There is this doctor
in northern california

424
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,298
Who is doing really amazing
things with kids who have a.D.D.

425
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,117
I want you
watch this tape.

426
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:37,468
Hello, i'm dr. Richard shay,

427
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,105
Here to tell you about my
exciting new drug-Free treatment

00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:43,974
Ya-Ya...

430
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,612
This treatment is
fast and effective

431
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,878
And doesn't use
harmful drugs.

432
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,516
Watch closely as i apply
treatment to the first child.

433
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,383
I want a horse-

434
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,684
I want a
big brown horse

435
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,517
With a fluffy black tail-

436
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,938
Sit down and study!

437
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,324
Oh, let's go race-

438
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,360
Sit down and study!

439
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,060
Wahhh, aah-

440
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,663
Stop crying and
do your schoolwork!

441
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,601

00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,674
"You can either calm down, or i

444
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,242
Well, what do you think.

445
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,313
I can have dr. Shay come to
south park for a small fee.

446
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,048
That video had
pretty colors.

447
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,367
It sure did.

448
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,651
What the-?

449
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,253
Dammit, have you all been taking
your children's ritalin too?

450
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,355
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

451
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,387
Oh, fudge it.

452
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,724
Chef, are you going to the
phil collins concert tomorrow?

453
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:32,990
The what?

454
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,291
Phil collins is playing
lollapalalas

455
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,061
And because we're all doing
so well in school now

456
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,363
Our parents said
they would take us.

457
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,063
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

458
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,134
Hold on a second, you children,
wantto go see phil collins.

459
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,303
Yes, his flowing melodies
are really enjoyable to us.

460
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,437
Oh, my god!

461
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,738
Come, see him with us.

462
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:52,509
Yes, come with us,
come with us.

463
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,112
Ahhh, it's christina aguillera
again, she's on my back.

464
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,051
That does it, the ritalin has affected
your little cracker brains too deeply.

465
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,052
I'm going to see
that damn pharmacist.

466
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,822
Look at that, ritalin stocks
are up ten points.

467
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,557
That's easily another
20 grand apiece.

468
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:10,763
Hey, open
this damn door!

469
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:11,630
Can i help you?

470
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:12,896
Yes, you can.

471
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:13,799
What the hell are
you two doing

472
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,499
Prescribing all
the children ritalin.

473
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,703
Well, they've all been
diagnosed with a.D.D.

474
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:18,969
That's attention deficit-

475
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,739
I know what it is,
but now you've got

476
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,041
A town full of
zombie children

477
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,342
From the planet zandor.

478
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,174
Huh?

479
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,476
All around the country,

480
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,463
You bastard doctors are
giving children ritalin,

481
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:29,415
And for every one child
that actually needs it

482
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,548
You give it to
50,000 that don't.

483
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,535
Hey now, don't tell us
our business, mr. Chef-

484
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,487
You damn right i'll
tell you your business,

485
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,055
Because you two have
your heads up your asses.

486
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,760
Thanks to you we have children in
our town that like phil collins.

487
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:42,826
What?!

488
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,561
That's right, you made them
so dull and boring

489
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,199
That they're actually going to
go to a phil collins concert.

490
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,802
My god,
what have we done?

491
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,502
But, if i'd known.

492
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,272
I mean, phil collins, my god.

493
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,959
Well, how do we
reverse the ritalin?

494
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,820
We have to convince
them not to take it,

495
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:00,646
But it'll be hard
to get it away from them.

496
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,381
Then we need
an antidote.

497
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,647
Yes, of course.

498
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,983
What's the antidote
for ritalin?

499
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,019
I have some right here,
it's a compound calledritalout.

500
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,622
We've got to get the antidote
to all the children, quick!

501
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,695
? That's not a word?

502
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,263
? Oh, boo boo?

503
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,883
? That's not a word?

504
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,433
? Boo, boo, yo?

505
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,503
Here, we can put the ritalin
antidote in these drinks

506
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,672
And hand them out
to the children.

507
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,142
? Boo boo boo-Dio?

508
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,744
Oh, wasn't
that great son?

509
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,445
It sure was, dad.

510
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,648
It's so wonderful to be on the
same wavelength as our kids.

511
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,251
Here you go, stan and
kyle, free drinks on me.

512
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,819
Oh, thank you, chef,
how nice.

513
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:47,493
And now, i'd like to sing the complex
and amazing song that won me the oscar.

514
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:52,698
A song entitled,
you be in me.

515
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,903
? You're inside of me?

516
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,807
? Deep inside of me?

517
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:08,947
? So deep in inside, i can feel
you pushing against my heart?

518
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,482
Come on drink
it down, it's free.

519
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,386
? You be inside of me?

520
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,086
Arr...
oh noo!

521
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,290
Get off me,
get off me!

522
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,990
Somebody help.

523
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,194
I feel... different.

524
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,061
Yeah.

525
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,796
Get off me
christina aguillera.

526
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,982
Drink this, eric.

527
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,943
God, help me.

528
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,574
She's gone.

529
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,691
Thank god.

530
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,738
What makes...

531
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:39,978
Wait a minute,
phil collin sucks ass!

532
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,147
Yeah, what the hell
were we thinking?

533
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,413
Boo!

534
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,966
I think
it's working.

535
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,450
Boo!
Boo! Boo!

536
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,087
Shut your filthy holes
you little bastards!

537
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,389
Get off the stage
phil collins!

538
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,690
We want timmy!

539
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:52,558
Yeah.

540
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,258
You just want to
laugh at him.

541
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,895
No, you see we learned
something today.

542
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,431
Yeah sure,
we laughed at timmy,

543
00:19:58,466 --> 00:19:59,849
But what's wrong
with laughter?

544
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,209
Just because
we laugh at something

545
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:02,534
Doesn't mean we don't
care about it.

546
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,703
Timmy made us smile and
playing made timmy smile,

547
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,403
So where was
the harm in that?

548
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,607
The people in the wrong, are the people
who think timmy should be protected

549
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,342
And kept out of the
public's eye.

550
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,042
The cool thing about
timmy being in a band

551
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,680
Was that he was in your face,
and you had to deal with him.

552
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,415
Whether you laughed
or cried or felt nothing.

553
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,716
That's why
timmy rules.

554
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,982
Yeah.

555
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:19,885
Timmy, timmy!

556
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,186
Timmy! Timmy! Timmy!

557
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,921
Timmy!
Timmy! Timmy!

558
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,958
Man it sucks not being
part of lollapalabala.

559
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,224
Yeah.

560
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,525
Hey dudes.

561
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,826
Skylar, what are
you doing here?

562
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,030
Isn't "reach for the skylar"
supposed to play soon?

563
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,199
They booed phil collins
off the stage.

564
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,465
Everyone is
chanting for

565
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,634
"Timmy and the
lords of the underworld".

566
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,272
So now that they want us
you think you can just

567
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,441
Waltz back into our lives
and be in the band again?

568
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,627
I don't expect
anything.

569
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:46,743
Timmy, i just
wanted to say

570
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,513
We had some pretty
rocking times, dude.

571
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,550
And maybe i let fame and
phil collins go to my head.

572
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,302
Timmy! Timmy! Timmy!

573
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,020
Timmy!
Timmy! Timmy!

574
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,189
Wow, they really are
chanting for us.

575
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,490
They want us back.

576
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,225
What do you say, timmy?

577
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:01,925
Timmy.

578
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,262
All right!
All right!

579
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado

580
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:11,069
It is my pleasure to introduce
the reunion tour oftimmy.

581
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,973

of the underworld.

my heart with pain?
