Dude, you're not gonna believe
what cartman has!

16
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:42,605
Hepatitis "b"?

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,305
No, dickhole.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,509
Four tickets, 28th row,
for theraging pussies.

19
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,678
You got raging
pussies tickets?!

20
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:49,944
We're going
tomorrow night.

21
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,280
Cartman's got the bus
schedule all figured out.

22
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:53,449
Hold on,
i'll be right back.

23
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,149
Mom, dad!

24
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:56,919
Can i go with the guys to see
the raging pussies?

25
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,619
No, kyle.

26
00:00:58,654 --> 00:00:59,955
But all the guys
are going!

27
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,257
Kyle, you're not
old enough.

28
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:02,992
And those concerts
are dangerous and vile.

29
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,161
But mom, i-
The answer is no, kyle!

30
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:06,462
Agh!

31
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:08,596
My parents said
i can't go.

32
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,234
Well, of course your parents
said you can't go!

33
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,934
Dummy! You don't ask
if you can go!

34
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,103
I'm telling my parents
i'm staying at stan's house,

35
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,439
Stan's telling his parent
he's staying at kenny's house,

36
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,391
And kenny's not telling
his parents anything

37
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,909
'Cause they're alcoholics
and they don't care.

38
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:20,742
Yeah!

39
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,078
Oh... well, now
i already told them.

40
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,379
Well, i guess
you're screwed then.

41
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:24,645
No, it's all right.

42
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,982
Just give me some time
to work on them.

43
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:27,717
I'll see you guys later.

44
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:31,187
But what if i do a bunch of
chores around the house?

45
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,488
Come on,
you're being unfair!

46
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:33,755
All right, fine, kyle,

47
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,056
You can go to the
raging pussies concert

48
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,826
If you clean out the garage,
shovel the driveway

49
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,561
And bring
democracy to cuba!

50
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:40,261
What's cuba?

51
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,899
A communist country run by a
dictator named fidel castro.

52
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,634
And do i have to shovel
the whole driveway

53
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:45,935
Or just the side
the car's on?

54
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,803
The whole thing.

55
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:48,936
Oh, geez.

56
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:52,008
Dear, mr. Castro,
my name is kyle.

57
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,345
I am an 8-Year-Old american boy
who lives in south park.

58
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,382
...and if i had
just one wish,

59
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:01,082
Just one wish
in the whole world...

60
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:04,370
? If i had one wish
it'd be for cuba to change?

61
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:08,183
? Because i think that
all the cubans are in pain?

62
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:11,961
? All the joy in the world
from sea to shining sea?

63
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,299
? Doesn't mean a thing
if cubans aren't free?

64
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:19,869
? I just can't be very happy
that's certain?

65
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:23,239
? Not as long as
your cubans are hurtin'?

66
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:24,939
? Oh, won't you
search your soul?

67
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:28,444
? And find a way
to change your mind?

68
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,914
? That is my
one and only wish?

69
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,083
Llamada todos junto!

70
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:37,518
Once again this does mark
the end of communism in cuba!

71
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:41,891
Cuban dictator fidel castro claims he was
finally convinced by a young boy's letter.

72
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,144
Now the country is again open
to american tourism.

73
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,964
Plans can finally resume for
knott's berry farm, cuba.

74
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,230
I did it!

75
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:50,566
Now i can go to
the raging pussies!

76
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,301
No, you can't.
What?

77
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,771
Kyle, your mother and i don't want you
going to the raging pussies concert.

78
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:57,506
We gave you a chore that
we thought was impossible.

79
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,242
You weren't supposed to
actually do it.

80
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:01,410
But i did,
i brought democracy to cuba.

81
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,677
We know, kyle,

82
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:04,447
But we just don't want you
going to that concert.

83
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,416
But that's not fair,
you lied to me!

84
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,051
Kyle, perhaps we
handled this wrong,

85
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,617
But you need to
understand that-

86
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:12,255
What i understand is that you
totally screwed me over!

87
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,556
So why should i have to
listen to you?

88
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,256
Because we're
your parents!

89
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,460
Well, i wish i didn't
have any parents!

90
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,761
Kyle!

91
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:21,762
It's so unfair!

92
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,497
How could my parents
do that to me?

93
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,268
Parents can be pretty cruel
sometimes, dude.

94
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:26,135
They get off on it.

95
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,401
They're evil.

96
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,136
I wish i didn't
have any parents!

97
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,774
Well... youcouldmake them
go away for a while. How?

98
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,943
Well, i mean,
youcouldcall the police

99
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:35,678
And have them
take your parents away.

100
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:36,510
The police?

101
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:37,812
Yeah, i saw it on tv.

102
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,113
All you gotta do is
call the police

103
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:40,449
And say that your parents
both "molestered" you.

104
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:42,583
What's that?
I don't know, but it works.

105
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:43,920
When i wanted to get rid of
my mom's last boyfriend

106
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:45,655
I just called the police,
and said he was molestering me,

107
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,624
And i haven't seen him
for three months.

108
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,558
Wow- Three months
without parents!

109
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,692
But what do the police
do to them?

110
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,462
Who cares? My parents
deserve whatever they get!

111
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:55,162
They're liars
and cheats!

112
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:56,499
You have to make it convincing,
though, when you call the police,

113
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,668
You have to be like,
"my parents molestered me!"

114
00:03:58,703 --> 00:03:59,934
My parents molestered me.

115
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,235
No, but you gotta cry,
like this-

116
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,838
My parents molestered me.

117
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,608
And then they'll say something like,
"was it good touch or bad touch?"

118
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,560
And you say,
"it was good touch."

119
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,078
No, wait,
you say it was bad touch.

120
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,344
What's bad touch?

121
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,247
Something about a swimsuit,
i don't remember.

122
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,982
But you definitely answer
"bad touch".

123
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,283
Okay- Molestered,
bad touch.

124
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:15,151
Yeah, and cry.

125
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,621
Oh, he's ready.

126
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,960
Oh my god,
this isn't happening!

127
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:27,947
I would never touch
my children like that!

128
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,899
You do have the right
to remain silent, ma'am,

129
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,868
I suggest you
use that right.

130
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,803
Please,
just listen to me!

131
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,937
Heh-Heh, heh-Heh.

132
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,273
What about
my children?

133
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:38,574
Who will take
care of them?

134
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,041
Oh, now you care?

135
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:41,711
They're going to live
with their grandmother.

136
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,346
Their grandmother's been
dead for three years!

137
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:45,046
You're not
listening to me!

138
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,551
Kyle, tell these people
that your...

139
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:55,491
They'll never be able
to hurt you again.

140
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:56,757
Cool, thanks.

141
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,395
All right, folks,
our work here is done.

142
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,600
All right!

143
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:14,143
? Just take those old records
off the shelf?

144
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:18,012
? I sit and listen to 'em
by myself?

145
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,951
? Today's music ain't
got the same soul?

146
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:25,005
? I like that old time
rock and roll?

147
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,399
? Don't try to take me
to a disco...?

148
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:29,724
Dude, having no parents
is awesome!

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,494
I'm gonna say my parents
molestered me, too!

150
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:32,760
Hey, yeah!

151
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,530
We should all say our
parents molestered us!

152
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:37,098
Yeah, all right.
Woo-Hoo!

153
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:41,036
?... I like that
old time rock and roll?

154
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:44,957
? Still like that old time
rock and roll?

155
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:48,844
? That kind of music
just soothes my soul?

156
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,982
? I reminisce about
the days of old?

157
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:57,086
? With that old time
rock and roll?

158
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:13,135
The following hot presentation
is for mature audiences only.

159
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,304
You guys,
come out here!

160
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:17,907
What's going on?

161
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,509
Notice anything?

162
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,678
Watch...

163
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:28,282
Nothing.
Yeah, nothing.

164
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,017
There's not an adult
left in town.

165
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,787
They've all been arrested, and
the ones that weren't arrested

166
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,522
Have moved away because they're
scared of being arrested.

167
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:36,559
Not one adult left?

168
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,560
Then it's ours.

169
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:42,631
The whole town...
it's ours.

170
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,692
Oh, sweetie, i have
no idea where we are.

171
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,770
I haven't seen
a road marker for miles.

172
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:57,778
What was the last highway
we were on?

173
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,982
There has to be a town
around here somewhere.

174
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,248
Maybe you're reading
the map wrong.

175
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,452
Hey, it was your idea
to take the back roads!

176
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:04,753
What the?

177
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:08,657
Oh no...
no, no, no, no.

178
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:10,392
What's the matter
with it?

179
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:11,659
I have no idea.

180
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,212
Oh, we're gonna have to
find some help quick.

181
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:14,730
We're not gonna make it
more than a couple miles.

182
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:17,333
Oh, look,
there's a town up ahead!

183
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:20,803
Smiley town?
That's a strange name.

184
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,069
Well, it'll have to do.

185
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:24,707
It's probably the only town
for 100 miles.

186
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:34,215
Hello!
Is anybody here?

187
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,950
Oh, uh-
Can i help you folks?

188
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:39,021
Yes, we need a mechanic
to look at our car.

189
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:42,057
Oh, well, uh...
i'm the mechanic, i guess.

190
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,792
What seems to be
the problem?

191
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,761
It's...
just you here?

192
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:47,696
No, craig's here, too.

193
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,529
Oh, good.

194
00:07:48,564 --> 00:07:50,299
But he's playin'
"spaceman" right now.

195
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,600
Hey, craig!

196
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:52,867
What?

197
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,602
Look, we're in a bit
of a spot here.

198
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:57,673
I've got a very important job interview
tomorrow morning in breckenridge

199
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,408
So i have to get
my car fixed fast.

200
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,143
Is there another
garage in town?

201
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,409
Uhh... no.

202
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:04,180
How about a phone,
can we just use the phone?

203
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,446
Phone here doesn't work.

204
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,650
I'm afraid the only phone
that does work...

205
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,402
Is over in "treasure cove".

206
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:11,120
Fine, can you
take us there?

207
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:13,722
You... sure you wanna go
to treasure cove?

208
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:14,989
Yes!

209
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,325
Oh, really,
are you sure?

210
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,591
Yes!

211
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,229
Oh, all right then,
show 'em where it is.

212
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,532
This is the end of
smiley town.

213
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,267
The only phone is somewhere
in treasure cove.

214
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,904
If you wanna find it, you're
gonna have to cross the white line.

215
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,873
Well, can you help us
find the phone, please?

216
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:32,808
Hell no, i'm not
crossing the white line.

217
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:33,676
Why not?

218
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:35,376
All right,
let's just go, linda,

219
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:37,580
I don't have time for
"spaceman spiff's" little games.

220
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:38,447
Craig.
What?

221
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,616
It's spaceman craig.

222
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,967
Carousel.

223
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:02,738
Nya-Nya,
nya-Nya-Nya!

224
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:07,908
Look, there's
an elementary school.

225
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:10,980
Come on, there might be
some teachers inside.

226
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,016
What is that?

227
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,751
Ahh!

228
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,090
What do you
want from us?

229
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,294
Linda, it's a
remote-Controlled car.

230
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,632
It looks like maybe there's
a little camera on it.

231
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,898
Mark, i don't like this.

232
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,969
Relax, linda,
everything's fine.

233
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:36,103
Ow, ow!

234
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:37,439
What is it-
Acid?

235
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,741
No, it's lemon juice!

236
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,042
Oh, god,
are you blind?

237
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,211
No, it just really,
really, really hurts!

238
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,813
Mark, mark, look.

239
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:58,260
Well, hello,
what's your name?

240
00:09:58,295 --> 00:09:59,995
What-What do you want?

241
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,531
We want to play.

242
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,997
Mark, i'm scared.

243
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,333
Don't be scared,
they're just kids.

244
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:05,634
Where are
your parents?

245
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,803
We already played
with our parents.

246
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:12,574
Now, we wanna play
with you.

247
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,743
Okay, i'm scared now, too,
that freaked me out.

248
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:17,780
We want to play
with you!

249
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,046
Get off me!

250
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:20,816
Oh god, mark, help!

251
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,154
Oh no, they're crossing
the white line!

252
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,889
Ohhh!

253
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,758
Spit wads!

254
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,094
Take that,
kindergartners!

255
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,263
Eww, gross!

256
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:37,733
What the hell
is going on here?!

257
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,902
Kindergartners
- Treasure cove is full of them.

258
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,371
All right, look kid, we demand
to see an adult this instant.

259
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,673
I got new orders, i'm supposed
to take you to see the mayor.

260
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,842
The mayor, good, finally.

261
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:54,650
Hello, mr. And mrs. Cotner,
won't you come in, please?

262
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:56,819
Mr. And mrs. Cotner,
as the mayor of smiley town,

263
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,554
I would like to ask you
a few questions.

264
00:10:58,589 --> 00:10:59,820
You're the mayor?

265
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,373
What the hell is
going on here?

266
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:02,891
Where are
all your parents?

267
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,193
Parents?

268
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,795
Ah, you mean
the birth-Givers.

269
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,062
They're not around.

270
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,398
No parents
in the entire town?

271
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,664
What happened to them?

272
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:12,399
Okay, see, i'm the mayor
of smiley town

273
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:14,169
And so i will ask
the questions around here.

274
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:16,355
Look, just point us to
a phone, kid, all right?

275
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,507
Heh-Heh, i'm afraid
you'll find all the phones...

276
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,609
Quite out of service.

277
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:20,641
No phones either?

278
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:22,810
How do you
communicate?

279
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:26,749
Butters, i need an e.T.A.
On the car, stat.

280
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,786
All right, we've had
just about enough here.

281
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,556
That's the most ridiculous
thing i've ever seen!

282
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:36,291
I don't care what little games
you kids wanna play,

283
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,894
We just want
out of here, all right?

284
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,665
It's gonna be
about three days.

285
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,268
So, it appears
that you need me.

286
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,871
Which is good, because,
i need you too.

287
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,137
Ringy-Ding?

288
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,341
I've got the job interview
of my life in breckenridge.

289
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,510
Just tell me how to get
a phone or a car!

290
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:56,244
Spitball!

291
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,511
Aah!

292
00:11:57,546 --> 00:11:59,246
You sons of bitches!

293
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:00,582
You see what we're
dealing with here?

294
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,849
Tonight is "carousel",

295
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,150
And they will try to
kill one of us.

296
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,788
You two seem to have the uncanny
ability to cross the white line.

297
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,824
If you help us,
we'll get you what you need.

298
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,259
Mark, are we doing
the right thing?

299
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:15,330
Look, if getting this stupid book
will get me a cell phone, i don't care!

300
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,933
I just don't know if you're dealing
with these kids the right way.

301
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:20,102
Well, i told you i can't
deal with kids, linda!

302
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,071
That's why i don't
want to have children!

303
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,923
Hey, i think you'd
make a great father.

304
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,706
Let's not go through
this again, linda.

305
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:28,777
Look, here's the book they've been
talking about that makes no sense.

306
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:30,946
My god, mark!

307
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,765
What is it?

308
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,116
It's a boy.

309
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:38,320
They... killed him.

310
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,489
The bastards...

311
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:42,224
Oh, mark,
let's get out of here!

312
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,525
Nya-Nya,
nya-Nya-Nya!

313
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,844
Aah!

314
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,128
Oh, no.

315
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,129
Mark!

316
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,333
Uh, the fat kid
told us to take it!

317
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,442
Wha- Ahh!

318
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,045
Mark, mark, wake up!

319
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,780
Nya-Nya, nya-Nya,
nya-Nya!

320
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:06,914
You guys, stop it!

321
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:09,551
Sorry about them,
kindergartners are kinda spazzes.

322
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:10,818
Yeah.

323
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:11,720
Why are you
doing this?

324
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,021
How come you wanna
help the fat-Ass?

325
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:13,889
Who?

326
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:15,190
The fat-Ass, the mayor.

327
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:17,359
Look, i have the
job interview of my life

328
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:19,528
In less than...

329
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,794
12 hours.

330
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:23,432
I just need a phone, and he said
he'd help me if i took your book

331
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,167
So you couldn't
kill them anymore.

332
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,433
You got "foolied",
outlander.

333
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,203
We're the only ones
with a working phone.

334
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,470
And if you'd
taken our book

335
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,240
Then it's one of us
who dies tonight at carousel.

336
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,506
How did this
all happen?

337
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,276
Why do you children
live in this town alone?

338
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,542
Because we do.

339
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,312
It was like this yesterday
and the day before that.

340
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:38,631
But what about
before that?

341
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,375
You mean
in the before-Time?

342
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,049
In the long, long ago?
Yes!

343
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,385
If we tell you, will you
help us stop the fat-Ass?

344
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,771
I'll do anything
to get to a phone.

345
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,688
All right,
everybody gather around.

346
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,458
We're gonna tell the story
of the before-Time again!

347
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,592
The before-Time!

348
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:52,893
Story of before-Time.

349
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,628
Way back,
in the long, long ago,

350
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,832
We all lived by the
birth-Givers' laws.

351
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,133
But the birth-Givers
were unfair.

352
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,868
They made us go to bed early
and eat broccoli.

353
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:01,603
Yuck, yuck, yuck!

354
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:04,206
And so the fat-Ass came up with a way
to have all the birth-Givers disappear,

355
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,375
By using the magic
"m"- Word.

356
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,641
Mmmmm!

357
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:09,845
Soon we were without power,
or water or fresh food,

358
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,014
But we tried to survive
under the guidance...

359
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,634
Of the provider.

360
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:17,184
Provider, provider.

361
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,786
But the fat-Ass and us disagreed
on how to worship the provider.

362
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:22,424
The fat-Ass tried to make us follow his
way by making himself the school principal.

363
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,593
So we made ourselves the
superintendents of schools.

364
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:26,293
But then he just
made himself the mayor.

365
00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:28,931
The town split sides, and that's
when the provider got angry.

366
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,631
Boom! Crash!

367
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,268
So every night, the provider
must be appeased at carousel.

368
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,003
We need their book,
so one of ours doesn't die.

369
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,571
Carousel, carousel.

370
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:39,775
We all know that one day
the provider will set us free,

371
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,944
Make everything like it was
in the before-Time.

372
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:43,895
In the long, long ago.

373
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,379
Let me
get this straight.

374
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:48,450
If i go get the fat kid's book on
the other side of the white line

375
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,185
You'll show me where
a cell phone is?

376
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:51,920
Yes, no foolies.

377
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,620
No foolies.

378
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:55,390
Let's go, it's,
it's right out here.

379
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:59,294
Linda, i want you to just go back to
the car and wait for me, all right.

380
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,331
I'll go get that fat kid's book
so i can use their phone.

381
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,597
Mark, i'm scared.

382
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,234
I know, but this will
all be over soon.

383
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,777
Oh, gerald, i haven't
seen you for so long!

384
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:16,610
Hello, honey.

385
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,163
How has prison been
for you?

386
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:19,646
Oh, it's awful,
just awful!

387
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:22,284
All right, parents,
let's all take our seats.

388
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,585
My name is scott evans,

389
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,754
And i am a prison
rehabilitation counselor.

390
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:27,454
Excuse me,
but my wife and i

391
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:29,224
Honestly never touched
our child.

392
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,543
Neither did we!

393
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:31,853
We didn't neither!

394
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,093
Enough, enough!

395
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:34,863
Look, it's obvious we have
a lot of emotional issues

396
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,598
And personal demons
to face here.

397
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,201
During your prison time, you will
all be spending one hour a day

398
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,901
In therapy
here with me.

399
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:44,840
What i want you to do, is learn to
control those sick, sexual urges you have.

400
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,540
Now we're gonna
try an exercise.

401
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:49,611
I'm gonna confront you with
what you lust after most.

402
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,648
All right, parents, now,
i know this is difficult,

403
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,250
But i want you to just
look at this child,

404
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,853
Just try to suppress
your urges to molest him.

405
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,256
Just think about
something else,

406
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,589
Think about clouds
and beaches.

407
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:05,227
Don't think about his supple,
soft, little body.

408
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,094
Oh, that's disgusting!

409
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,361
Now stop this!

410
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:08,697
Fight your urges,
mr. Brovlofski!

411
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:09,963
I don't have any urges!

412
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:12,167
I can't help you if you won't
admit you need help!

413
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,301
Now, sit down!

414
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,938
Look, i know this is very
difficult for all of you.

415
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:19,341
Most of you are still in denial
about what you've done.

416
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,710
To you, it seems you never
molested your children at all!

417
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,976
But you did.

418
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,397
Help me... help you.

419
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,691
Now let's
try again.

420
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,923
Look at this young man.

421
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,120
Just look...
don't molest.

422
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,723
Fight it, fight it!

423
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:35,989
Oh god, god.

424
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,193
Please just let us
get out of this place.

425
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:41,229
I think i found
the problem, ma'am.

426
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,398
Broken window roller-Upper.

427
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,133
Oh no, no!

428
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,868
Ahh!

429
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:49,905
Where is
your husband?

430
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,737
Uh...

431
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:52,708
Seize her!

432
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:56,845
All right,
i got the book for you.

433
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,678
Awesome!

434
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:59,448
Now can i please
have the cell phone?

435
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,183
Sure, outlander,
i'll get it.

436
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,918
Outlander!

437
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,653
Outlander!

438
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,220
We have your woman!

439
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,858
She still lives,
outlander!

440
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:13,293
Outlander,
her blood will spill!

441
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:15,063
What the heck are you
talking about?

442
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:18,065
Butters, calm down,
all right.

443
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,702
Okay, so what are some
other things that we can do

444
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:24,172
Besides molest
our children?

445
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,474
See a movie?

446
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:27,209
Sure, see a movie's good.

447
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,944
We could see a movie instead of
molesting our children.

448
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:30,210
What else?

449
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:31,511
Make a sweater?

450
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,715
Uh-Huh, i'll put
"knitting/sewing".

451
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,450
Who's got another one?

452
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:36,318
Molest children?

453
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,053
No, no, we're looking
for things to do

454
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,788
Besidesmolesting
our children.

455
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:41,488
Oh... fishing?

456
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:42,789
Fishing's good, uh-Huh.

457
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,993
I believe you have something
of ours, outlander.

458
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,294
Give it back
or the female gets it!

459
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:47,561
Unh!

460
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:48,862
Heh-Heh.
Unh!

461
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,163
Give him
the book back!

462
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:52,367
No, if they have it one of
ours will die for carousel!

463
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:53,235
We're running
out of time!

464
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:54,536
Hand our book over,
quick!

465
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,802
Enough of this!

466
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:58,006
You kids are all
in big trouble!

467
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,115
The provider awakes!

468
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,284
It's time for carousel.

469
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:11,418
Ha ha, your side doesn't
have its book, fat-Ass!

470
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,188
That means someone on your side
is sacrificed tonight!

471
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,454
God dammit!

472
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,658
All right,
it is decided.

473
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,393
Butters, your turn.

474
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,996
Oh, i'm gonna be sacrificed
to the provider!

475
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:22,262
Stop right there!

476
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,997
Nobody's killing
anybody tonight!

477
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:26,635
Be careful, mark, they'll make you disappear with the "m"
- Word!

478
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,671
Yeah, we'll call the police
and say you molestered us too!

479
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,239
What?

480
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:33,575
I'm here for you,
provider!

481
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,407
Take me!

482
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,143
Is that what happened
to the adults here?!

483
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,780
You lied to the police
and said they molested you?

484
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:42,250
My god, they were
your parents!

485
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,517
Parents?

486
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,287
The birth-Givers!

487
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:46,822
Your... birth-Givers.

488
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,323
Don't you remember?

489
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:51,758
They are your "providers"-
Not some statue!

490
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:55,263
And they're not off in some
fantastical far away land now...

491
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:56,963
They're in prison!

492
00:18:56,998 --> 00:19:00,468
Probably crying themselves
to sleep, cold and lonely and...

493
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:04,372
I'm sure, missing you all
very, very much.

494
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,109
Your birth-Givers
took care of you.

495
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:12,614
That's what their laws and their
rules were for, because they love you,

496
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,650
And they didn't want you to
end up living like, like this.

497
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,819
Hewon't take care of you.

498
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:23,458
Your parents,
your... providers, will.

499
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,861
Parents...

500
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:28,195
Mom, dad.

501
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,496
Oh boy,
here it comes!

502
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:33,001
If you want things to be the way
they were in the before-Time,

503
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,736
In the long, long ago,

504
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,074
You all need to call the police and
tell them you lied about the m-Word.

505
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,208
He's right, dude.

506
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,978
Things were a lot better
with our parents around.

507
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:45,545
Yeah, i guess their rules
did have a point.

508
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,183
Things have gotten a lot worse in
the 10 days since they've been gone.

509
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:49,883
10 days?

510
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:52,087
It's only been 10 days
since they left?

511
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,353
Take him down.

512
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,256
Hey, what are you doing?

513
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,424
I'm ready to give myself
to mr. Elway!

514
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:57,292
Here's our
cell phone, dude,

515
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,426
Will call the
police for us?

516
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:02,497
Hey, looks like you're not so
bad with kids after all.

517
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:04,449
Yeah, i guess you're right.

518
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:05,876
Maybe we should
have some.

519
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:07,269
Yeah, right,
after all this?

520
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,871
I'm getting my
tubes tied tomorrow!

521
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:18,945
Come on, you guys, our parents
are gonna be back any minute.

522
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,282
Do you think they're gonna be pissed
at us for lying that they molested us

523
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,017
And sending them all
to jail for 10 days?

524
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,318
Well, they can't be
too pissed off,

525
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:24,619
I mean, we made them
a banner.

526
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:25,886
Hey, kids!

527
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:26,753
Hey, you guys
came back!

528
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,089
Did you make it to
your job interview?

529
00:20:28,124 --> 00:20:29,356
Yeah, i got the job.

530
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,993
You're looking at the new
manager ofdenny's in breckenridge.

531
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,728
And i got
my tubes tied!

532
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:34,596
All right!

533
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,897
Well, thanks for
everything, you guys.

534
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,066
You really helped us see
how important parents are.

535
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,332
Yeah!

536
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,102

537
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:44,789
Mom, dad!

538
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:46,741
Kids!

539
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:49,778
Come here, come here.

540
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:52,814
Oh, kyle,
ike sweetie, you're okay!

541
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:54,514
Yeah, we're fine.

542
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:57,585
Kyle, we're so sorry for the
horrible sexual abuse over the years.

543
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,286
But we're all
better now.

544
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,622
But, you didn't
do anything to me.

545
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:01,888
Ahp- We did.

546
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,224
We've come to terms with it
through therapy

547
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,491
And learned
to admit it.

548
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:06,695
It won't happen again!
But, you guys, i-

549
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:09,731
Oh, stanley, i wish we could
take back all the years of abuse,

550
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:10,997
But we can't.

551
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,201
We've learned to
overcome it, son,

552
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,069
You'll see.

553
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:15,769
We love you, son,

554
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,973
But we only love you in
a platonic way, from now on!

555
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:20,141
What the heck are you
talking about?

556
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,310
Kenny, kenny,
we're sorry.

557
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:23,576
Where is he?

558
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,347
Everything's gonna be
all right now, jenny.

559
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,383
Come on, let's go home.

560
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,517
Huh.
Huh.

561
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:32,287
Well, what are you kids
gonna do now?

562
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,553
I dunno.

563
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:34,889
You guys wanna go
build a snow igloo?

564
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:35,722
Sure.

565
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,926
