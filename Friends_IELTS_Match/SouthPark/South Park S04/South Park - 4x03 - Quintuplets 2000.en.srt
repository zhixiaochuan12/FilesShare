Oh, i'm so excited.

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,738
I've always wanted to see
"cirque du cheville".

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,907
Me too, we were lucky
to get tickets.

18
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,659
Come on boys,
we're gonna be late!

19
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,403
Oh, don't they
look precious!

20
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,077
Why do we have to
dress up?

21
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,281
Isn't this just a circus with
elephants and lions and stupid clowns?

22
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,450
No stanley, cirque du cheville
is french canadian.

23
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,619
They get acrobats and singers
from all over the world

24
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:53,920
And do very
artistic things.

25
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,186
Ahh...!

26
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,173
Why the hell do you wanna
take these boys

27
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,034
To see that "fufu"
french theater crap?!

28
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,832
You're gonna turn them
into "poofters".

29
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,560
Dad, stanley needs
to see the arts.

30
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,764
Well, he, doesn't need
to see a bunch of frogs

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,464
Prance around in
tights and makeup

32
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,668
Wrapping their peckers
around each other's faces!

33
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,403
Come on everybody,
let's go.

34
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,572
Close your eyes and
cover your ears, billy!

35
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,741
Remember, you're a man!

36
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,477
Oh, this is so exciting.

37
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,681
Oh, look at the
funny clown, stanley.

38
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:22,549
Where?

39
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,151
Oh, no.

40
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,224
Ah, very funny,
thank you, goodbye.

41
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,127
No, thank you.

42
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,695
Go away, please.

43
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,466
He doesn't want your dumb-Ass
umbrella, clown, beat it!

44
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,201
Ow!

45
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,141
You didn't know that was
gonna happen, did you, stanley?

46
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,841
Oh god,
that was so funny!

47
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,647
Oh man, somebody stop my guts
from bursting out of my sides.

48
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,516
Ladies and gentlemen,
please no smoking

49
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,154
And no flash photography
duringcirque du cheville.

50
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,323
Cirque du che-Blehh.

51
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,866
Ooh-Ho, we've reached
fagtrack and bob, captain.

52
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,601
Eric, shh!

53
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,071
How long does
this thing last?

54
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:19,389
Two hours.

55
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:20,673
Awww!
Awww!

56
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,808
Ooh, these are the contorting
quintuplets from romania.

57
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,979
Woo hoo!

58
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,616
What, what- Another
gay guy in feathers?

59
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,954
Wow!

60
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,328
Damn, dude!

61
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,533
Oh, yay!

62
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,535
Oh, that was
wonderful.

63
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,738
Yes, too bad that was their
last show or i'd go see it again.

64
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,872
Those contorting
romanian chicks ruled.

65
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,076
Yeah, especially that
second one from the left,

66
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:30,944
She was fine.

67
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:31,811
Cartman, what the hell
you're talking about?

68
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,511
They're identical!

69
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,847
Not that second one from the
left, she had it going on!

70
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,016
Don't forget to buy
your souvenirs, folks.

71
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,571
Damn, dude, you see how much
money this place is raking in?

72
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,523
Yeah, i could prance around
in tights and sing opera too

73
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:44,789
For that kind of cash.

74
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,958
Hey, we should start our own
cirque du cheville.

75
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,162
Yeah, this one's moving out
of town, so we could take over.

76
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,897
Let's go practice.

77
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,031
Hurry up, girls.

78
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,018
We must bundle up
against the cold.

79
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,970
Did we do good
final show, grandmama?

80
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,236
Very good, my girls.

81
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,006
I only wish it weren't
your last show.

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,175
I love this country
so very much.

83
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,742
Mrs. Vladchik,
it is time.

84
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,946
It is time
to return to romania.

85
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,646
Yes, yes, of course.

86
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:13,453
Just give me one second
to finish getting them ready.

87
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,092
This way, girls, quickly.

88
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,961
Why are we going out
the window, grandmama?

89
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,164
Your mother did not want you
to grow up in romania.

90
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,635
This is our only chance.

91
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,611
Mrs. Vladchik?

92
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,853
They're trying to defect!

93
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,624
We need a boat.

94
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,376
Where to, mack?

95
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,094
Follow that boat.

96
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,036
Ow!

97
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,372
Heh-Heh, heh-Heh...

98
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,674
Ahhh!

99
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,191
Dude, this isn't working.

100
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,276
It's kenny's singing.

101
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,109
Huh?

102
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,445
Yeah, kenny,
you have to sing better.

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,711
I'm singing
as good as i can!

104
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,481
Well, it's not
good enough, kenny.

105
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,216
You have to get better,
try again!

106
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,784
Aha, i knew it.

107
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,120
They turned you
into poofters.

108
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,326
There's nowhere to go,
mrs. Vladchik, pull over!

109
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,398
Okay, girls,

110
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,508
Did we do good,
grandmama?

111
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,411
Very good, gracas.

112
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,448
I'm tired, grandpa.

113
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,050
No, billy, you're gonna stay
here and watch more "macgyver".

114
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,219
We're gotta get all the
frenchy-Fu fag nasties outta ya.

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,255
Who the hell would be
ringing the doorbell

116
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,574
This time of night?

117
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:58,858
I don't know...

118
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,593
Whoa!

119
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,063
We are very sorry
to disturb you.

120
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,197
My granddaughters
are cold and tired.

121
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,702
Is there any possibility we could
pay you for a place to sleep?

122
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,454
You're from
cirque du cheville.

123
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:13,137
Yes, we...
missed our train.

124
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,775
If we could shelter here,
it would only be for one night.

125
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,041
Well...

126
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,811
Well, of course you can,
come in out of the snow.

127
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,945
Oh, thank you
so much!

128
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,715
There's some spare
bedrooms upstairs, mrs...

129
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:23,981
Vladchik.

130
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,402
That grandma's not
a bad piece of ass.

131
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,788
Eww, dad, not
in front of stanley.

132
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,957
Well, it's good for him.

133
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,536
Hello and welcome to "singing
like bocelli for dummies".

134
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:44,837
Lesson one:

135
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,910
Lesson two:

136
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,514
Good.

137
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,019
And now we'll do the
entire piece conte partiro.

138
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,622
Conte partiro?

139
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,312
Got everything
you need there, do you?

140
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,250
Yes, you've all been so kind
to my little granddaughters.

141
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,853
They're quite agile
little things, aren't they?

142
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,588
Yes, as i was
back in my day.

143
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,323
I was a
contortionist too.

144
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,492
You don't say?

145
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,793
Yes.

146
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:45,998
You... remember any of
that stuff, do ya?

147
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:03,783
Oh... man.

148
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,687
Ohhh...

149
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,326
And now lesson four, the
complete works of mozart.

150
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:14,193
Let's begin.

151
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,928
Gah!

152
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,350
What should we do,
randy?

153
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,834
I like these
romanians, fine,

154
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,905
But i hope that old woman isn't
planning on staying here much longer.

155
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,508
Yeah, it's 11:00 and
she's still sleeping.

156
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:30,260
Poor, dear,
must be tired.

157
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:31,978
You're damn right
she's tired.

158
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,244
Huh?

159
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,580
Oh nothin', she's just gonna
have a little trouble

160
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,315
Walkin' today is all.

161
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,617
Hurry up, you guys.

162
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,883
What's going on?

163
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,785
Dude, you're not
gonna believe this.

164
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,052
What?

165
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,171
Hello.
Hello.

166
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,256
Hi.
Hello.

167
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,424
No way, the bitches from
cirque du che-Blah!

168
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,159
Yeah, they're quintuplets
from romania.

169
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,860
What's a quintuplet?

170
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,931
We are twins, except there are
five of us instead of two.

171
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,466
But, there's only
four of you.

172
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,035
No no, natalia is just playing
mirror buddies with nadia.

173
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,101
Hello!

174
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,305
So, if you're identical, does
that mean you all think alike?

175
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,606
No, don't be ridiculous!

176
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,775
Will you guys be
in our cirque du cheville?

177
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,510
You have your own?

178
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,811
Kenny has to get
better at singing first.

179
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,644
Hey!

180
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,980
But, as soon as he
starts singing better,

181
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:08,848
We're all gonna
make bank!

182
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,149
Okay.
Sounds good.

183
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,450
Count me in.
Okay.

184
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,986
Oh, and me.

185
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,452
Alright!

186
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,788
Alright, we've gotta
figure out what to do.

187
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:16,621
I'm gonna go
wake her up.

188
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,993
Hello, mrs...
mrs. Old romanian woman...

189
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,596
Ma'am?

190
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,741
A little tuckered, is she?

191
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,609
No, dad.

192
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,344
A little cottony
in the crotch?

193
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,079
No dad, she's dead!

194
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:40,947
What?

195
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,115
Oh, dear jesus!

196
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,718
It looks like she
had a heart attack.

197
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,887
No wonder she didn't
say goodnight.

198
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,587
Eww!

199
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,923
Okay, hold it,
hold it.

200
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,224
Ow!

201
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,695
I don't know how to
tell them, you tell them.

202
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,863
Uh, girls,
we have some bad news.

203
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,130
What?

204
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:04,804
Umm... everyone who has
a grandma, step forward.

205
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,406
Uh, not so fast girls.

206
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,577
Randy!

207
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,214
Grandmama is dead?

208
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,383
What are we
going to do now?

209
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,951
Hey guys, come here.

210
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,588
This is
totally awesome.

211
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,456
What?

212
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,722
How can
you say that?

213
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,625
Because now we can
convince them to stay here

214
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,227
And now our circus
will kick ass.

215
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,493
Oh yeah!

216
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,697
Mom, dad, can the quints stay
with us, please, can they?

217
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:32,964
Well, stanley,
it's not really-

218
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,167
They have nowhere
else to go, please!

219
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,336
Well, for the time being,
i, i mean...

220
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,071
Of course
they can stay.

221
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,771
Hooray!

222
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,808
Tom, i'm standing
at the home in south park

223
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,747
Where five precious little girls
have been rescued from romania.

224
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,447
Their mother passed away
some months ago

225
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,518
And then their grandmother died
trying to bring them here.

226
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,218
But all is well now
and people are coming

227
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,422
From all over the country
to view the little tykes.

228
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,591
If you'd like to come down
and see the quintuplets

229
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,291
Admission is only
five dollars.

230
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,928
And for a few dollars more,
you can feed them fish sticks.

231
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:03,796
Mmm!

232
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,531
Tom, it looks like
these cute little girls

233
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,001
Have made it out of that armpit
of a country they call romania.

234
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,122
Yes, luckily for them,
these quintuplets no longer

235
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:16,809
Have to live in romania,
the asshole of the world.

236
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:17,911
Back to you, tom.

237
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,943
This is not good.

238
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,147
It makes our country
look poor and stupid.

239
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,882
This could kill
our tourism.

240
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,449
You know what to do.

241
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,822
Alright, kenny, let's start
with some warm-Up exercises.

242
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,762
Well, what do you think?

243
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,497
Can you help him
become a better singer?

244
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,197
Well, he's got potential.

245
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,967
Depends on how good
he wants to be.

246
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,234
Very, very good!

247
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,403
Well, if you want
to be arealsinger

248
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,606
You need to go to
a conservatory in europe,

249
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,908
There's just
no other alternative.

250
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:49,740
Europe?

251
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,042
We can't
afford that.

252
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,245
Well, then i'm afraid your
son will always be a hack.

253
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,512
Nnn...

254
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,247
Well, kenny, if it
means that much to you,

255
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,752
Maybe we can bus it to europe and
you can sing on the way to make money.

256
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,018
Yeah!

257
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,090
Randy, randy, you better
have a look at this.

258
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,790
What?

259
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,993
...until the u.S. Government
received this video

260
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,162
Which was sent from romania
just hours ago.

261
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,296
Hello, this is
romanian father.

262
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,367
I am desperate to have my
girls returned to me in romania.

263
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,235
Uh-Oh.

264
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,536
That's your dad?

265
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,803
Maybe.

266
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,006
We haven't seen papa
for more than five years.

267
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,308
How i miss them all-

268
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:23,609
Little nada-

269
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,875
Nadia!

270
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,212
Nadia,
my sweet barsca.

271
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,513
Bartonia!

272
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,081
Bartonia- Anyway, my heart
is aching for their return.

273
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,152
I know the american government
will do us right, thank you.

274
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,772
Oh no, dude, if he they get
sent back to romania,

275
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:38,322
We'll never get our
cirque du cheville going!

276
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,526
Mom, dad, you're not gonna
send them back, are you?

277
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,129
Well, i think
we... have to.

278
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:44,447
Don't we?

279
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:45,696
I don't know.

280
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,466
You don't wanna go back
to stinky romania, do you?

281
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,299
It sucks there!

282
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,635
Yeah, america
is so much cooler.

283
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,237
In romania they just oppress
you and try to bring you down.

284
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,406
We'll have to call the police
and see what they want us to do.

285
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,107
Damn, we might be
screwed.

286
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,744
No, we've just gotta convince these
chicks that america kicks the ass

287
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,612
Out of every
other country.

288
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:00,913
Come on!

289
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,794
You see in america,
we have log rides...

290
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,734
Bacon double cheeseburgers!

291
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,108
Sheep shearing contests.

292
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,843
Yeah, woo hoo!

293
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,916
And shopping malls!

294
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,651
Yay!

295
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,555
Woo hoo!

296
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,122
Mrs. Janet reno,

297
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,194
You must understand the father
has right to his children.

298
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:50,362
Yes, but the girls seem
to wanna stay here.

299
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,531
Why don't you all
stay here in america

300
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,266
And this whole thing
can go away?

301
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,134
Okay.

302
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,869
Our home is romania.

303
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,135
We love it there!

304
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,304
Ah, yes,
we love it there.

305
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,508
If daughters will not
return on their own

306
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,243
You must force them
to return.

307
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,845
Gentlemen, this has to be
handled very delicately.

308
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,014
You don't understand
americans' power to protest.

309
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,281
Protest?

310
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,051
Look, people have it
so good in america

311
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,751
That they get bored
very easily.

312
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,388
And when people get bored
they start protesting things.

313
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:17,256
Ohh!

314
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,991
But i want to assure you
and the romanian people

315
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,244
That we're going to do
everything in our power

316
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,064
To make this all
as confusing as possible.

317
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,534
Let the quints stay!

318
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,835
Romania is gay!

319
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,570
Let the
quints stay!

320
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:32,872
Romania is gay!

321
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,008
Fur is murder,
fur is murder!

322
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,711
Oh, what are we
protesting here?

323
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,146
Romania sucks.

324
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,547
Oh, let's see...

325
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,247
Here we go.

326
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,885
Romania sucks,
romania sucks...!

327
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,186
Oh my god...

328
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,320
I didn't know this was going
to become such a big deal.

329
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,523
That'll teach us for taking an
old lady and her granddaughters

330
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,790
Out of the cold.

331
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,560
Attention people
inside the house:

332
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,596
You must return the quintuplets
to their father.

333
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,565
You have until...

334
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,465
Oh yeah, that's good.

335
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,103
You have until
easter sunday to comply.

336
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:04,935
Boo.

337
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,488
Boo!

338
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:08,783
What?

339
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:11,008
Get em!

340
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,077
Okay,
let's try it again.

341
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,177
Hup!

342
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,296
Alright!

343
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,346
Stan, we-

344
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,647
Stanley, we have
some bad news.

345
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,285
The courts have decided the
girls must go back to romania.

346
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,551
No, they can't!

347
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,887
We've convinced them that
they want to stay in america.

348
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,622
Yeah, we showed them
amusement parks and malls.

349
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:24,924
How can you expect them
to go back now?

350
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,225
I'm sorry, boys,

351
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,827
But janet reno is having them
taken away on easter sunday.

352
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,129
We don't have a choice.

353
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:30,996
Sorry, girls.

354
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,165
Now what do we do?

355
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,769
Tom, it is now
easter morning

356
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,070
And as the u.S. Government
promised,

357
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,540
They are here to take the girls
back to their father in romania.

358
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:49,481
Rumor has it that janet reno herself
will be extraditing the quintuplets.

359
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,950
Alright, miss reno,
let's go over the plan.

360
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,216
Right!

361
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,951
We'll drop you in the northwest
corner of the backyard.

362
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,155
You hop into the back of the
house and find the quintuplets.

363
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,456
When you see them,
you say:

364
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,457
Hello, girls,
i'm the easter bunny.

365
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,095
Good, and then hand them the
easter eggs filled with tear gas.

366
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,064
Are you ready?
Ready.

367
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,999
Go blue!
Go blue!

368
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,012
Yes, we would like very much to have
you here at the romanian music school.

369
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:20,844
Woo hoo!

370
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,146
How much is all this
gonna cost?

371
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,217
Don't worry, miss mccormack,
romania is very poor country.

372
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,917
Apartments are cheap,
food is cheap.

373
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,771
Everything is cheap because
we are so goddamn poor.

374
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,591
Yes, your 200 american dollars
will last months here.

375
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,343
Wow, what a great country.

376
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,061
Everybody's poor like us.

377
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,363
Yeah!

378
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,568
Hello, girls,
i'm the easter bunny.

379
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,038
Happy easter, kids.

380
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,074
Come see what
i brought for ya.

381
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,978
Hey, terence,
i think i have to fart.

382
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,930
Wait, before you do...

383
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,448
Oh, look,
an easter egg!

384
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,449
Oh, sh-

385
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,220
That's it,
let's move move move!

386
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:02,955
Give us the kid now!

387
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,221
Now!

388
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,991
Down on the floor,
down on the goddamn floor!

389
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,257
Find them!

390
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,763
This is a bust,
hand over the quints!

391
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,365
Hand over the children-
Happy easter-

392
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,901
Hand over the children!

393
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,402
What the hell's
goin' on?

394
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:17,234
Freeze, asshole.

395
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,004
Oh, go ahead and shoot me,
i dare ya!

396
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,270
Don't push me, man.

397
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,607
Pull the trigger,
you little pussy.

398
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,142
Dahhh!

399
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,994
Gun, gun!

400
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,354
Down, down!

401
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,679
Riot, riot!

402
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,282
Pepper spray,
pepper spray!

403
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,596
Dammit, now i'm never gonna
have my own circus.

404
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, your son is so
talented miss mccormack.

405
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:58,477
The people of romania
love him.

406
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,743
Good job, kenny.

407
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,381
Miss mccormack, we would love
for you and your son

408
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,550
To stay here in romania...
with us.

409
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,250
Will you consider it?

410
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,551
What do you think, kenny?

411
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,755
You'd have to leave your
friends and family behind.

412
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,622
Sure!

413
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,357
Alright!

414
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,960
Oh, randy, it's gone.

415
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:16,226
It's all gone.

416
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,528
Dude, what the
hell happened?

417
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,864
Government came
and got the quintuplets.

418
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,564
No more cirque
du cheville for us.

419
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,334
Dammit, how come every time
we get a sweet idea

420
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,635
The government has to
screw it up?

421
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,370
Yeah, well not this time.

422
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,203
Huh?

423
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,539
We just gotta get that
angry mob back on our side.

424
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,239
Alright, everybody,
listen up!

425
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,443
Those bastards broke in here
and took those poor quintuplets

426
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,178
To the mayor's office
downtown.

427
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,445
But they haven't won yet.

428
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,215
I say we all go over
to the mayor's office

429
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,950
And demand to see
the quintuplets right now!

430
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,819
Hmm... yeah...

431
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,890
I don't know, i usually like
to stop protesting by 5:30.

432
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,625
Yeah, do we get
overtime for this?

433
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,794
Uh sure,
you all get overtime.

434
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,661
Alright!
Yeah!

435
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,698
Down with japan!
Get 'em!

436
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,337
Alright, we just need to get a few more
pictures of the girls reunited with their father

437
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,072
So that everyone
knows they're happy.

438
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,206
Come on girls, smile.

439
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,976
We want you
to look happy, smile.

440
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,242
Look at the silly frog.

441
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,880
Who's got the silly frog,
look at him, i've got-

442
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:11,350
Look at him,
it's so silly, i'm so silly.

443
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,121
Ah, hello, this is kenny's dad
back in america.

444
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,422
I miss my son
very much.

445
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,556
I would like to see him
returned to me

446
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,194
So that the u.S. Government
will buy me a new car and-

447
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,026
Ow!

448
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,664
I mean, because i miss
my son very much.

449
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:27,833
Man.

450
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,435
Hey, we wanna
see the quintuplets.

451
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,702
You can't see them, boys.

452
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,472
They're happily reunited
with their father.

453
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,508
Come on, angry mob.

454
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,943
Ahhh!

455
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,147
Alright, it is time for us
to return to romania.

456
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,448
What is that?

457
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,184
It's the protestors,
they're back.

458
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,450
Goddammit.

459
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,786
We'll take care
of them, come on!

460
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,888
Let's move, move!

461
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:49,955
C'mon, c'mon!

462
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,991
This is government
property.

463
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,028
You ruined my house!

464
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,029
What are you
doing, nadia?

465
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm calling the only person
in the world who can help us.

466
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,572
Take that.

467
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,741
Stop it, stop it,
stop it!

468
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,378
All of you are
acting like idiots.

469
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:14,645
Yeah!

470
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,946
None of you
care about us.

471
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,716
You only care about
yourselves.

472
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:18,982
Look at you, father.

473
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,969
You walked out on us
five years ago

474
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:22,921
And now you act like
you miss ussomuch.

475
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,656
You are a liar
and a fake.

476
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,923
Yeah, you suck, dude.

477
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,777
And you romanian leaders-
You don't care about us!

478
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,597
All you care about is making
america look stupid.

479
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:33,297
Yeah, you guys
are dicks.

480
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,934
And you protestors
- Don't you have anything better to do?

481
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,669
Get a life!

482
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:38,502
Yeah!

483
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,838
And you boys
are the worst of all.

484
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,104
Huh? Huh?

485
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,839
You know nothing
about romania

486
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,442
And yet you assume
america is so much better.

487
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,947
Maybe romania isn't as nice
as america, but it is our home.

488
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,249
We are romanian.

489
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,719
All you care about
is your own stupid circus.

490
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,538
Where are you going, girls?

491
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:57,623
The only
place we can go.

492
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,756
We are going on oprah
and then a book tour.

493
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,262
Yes, you can all kiss our
little white romanian asses.

494
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,900
Oh well, doing our own circus
was a dumb idea anyways.

495
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,167
Yeah, screw them!

496
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,503
Kenny was never gonna
get his singing right anyway.

497
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,203
Whatever happened
to kenny?

498
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:17,975
Let kenny stay,
let kenny stay...!

499
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,612
Alright people, the father
wants his son returned to him.

500
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,080
Hand him over to us.

501
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,180
Boo!

502
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,733
Shut up, romanians.

503
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,377
Alright, let's go.

504
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:27,986
Move move move!

505
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,324
Hand over the boy, now!

506
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,590
Okay, okay.

507
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,794
I mean it, lady,
you've got about-

508
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,529
Whoops.
