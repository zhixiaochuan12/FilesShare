00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:09,976
? I'm going down
to south park?

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,145
? Gonna have
myself a time?

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,845
? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,615
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,450
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,936
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:20,387
? Ample parking
day or night?

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,122
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,073
? Headed on up
to south park?

11
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,592
? Gonna see if
i can't unwind?

12
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,580
? So come on down
to south park?

13
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:32,098
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,603
Gentlemen, i understand you are here
to present both sides of an issue.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,303
I want to
hear you both out,

16
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,038
And do this in a civil
and constructive manner,

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,808
So that i can give you both the
time and attention you deserve.

18
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,543
Jimbo, why don't
you begin?

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,278
Mayor, it's about
the south park flag.

20
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,013
Oh, jesus christ,
not this again.

21
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,182
We cannot change
the south park flag, mayor!

22
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,448
Mayor, as i've
said before

23
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,953
I find that flag to be
racist and insensitive.

24
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,653
Chef, i respect you
very much.

25
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,640
But you have to understand
that this hasbeen

26
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:00,152
The south park flag
since some of our ancestors,

27
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,629
Like my great-Grandfather,
founded this land.

28
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,329
That flag
represents a time

29
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,064
When blacks were
persecuted by whites.

30
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,233
How can a black man
not be bothered by it?

31
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,870
Alright, chef, i'll have
my assistants hold up the flag,

32
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,473
And you tell me what exactly
you find racist about it.

33
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,511
You don't see anything
wrong with that flag!

34
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,714
Chef, what about the baseball
team, the cleveland indians, huh?

35
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,883
Should they change their name
because it's racist?

36
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:24,984
Yeah.

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,486
No, because it's
their history!

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,089
Look, i have gone through
every quiet protest i could.

39
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:31,222
I've written everyone,
i've put up signs.

40
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,595
But now i'm telling you,
this flag will be changed!

41
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,764
And i'm telling you
it won't!

42
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,065
Oh boy.

43
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,067
Okay, children,
in mr. Garrison's absence,

44
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,704
I would like to turn the class's
attention to current issues.

45
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,523
Some people think the south
park flag should be changed,

46
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:50,035
While others believe that
changing the flag is wrong.

47
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,512
I think this is a perfect
subject for your debate club!

48
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,212
Aw!
Aw!

49
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,416
I see that you've already had a lot
of interesting debates this year...

50
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:59,417
Pro-Choice vs. Cartman,
pro-Gun control vs. Cartman,

51
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,489
And people against the clubbing
of baby seals vs. Cartman.

52
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:05,091
And apparently, the winner
of all your debates so far

53
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,410
Has been-
Cartman.

54
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,659
Thaaaaat's right!

55
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,995
Cartman doesn't
always win!

56
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,164
He just gets pissed off and goes
home, so we can't debate any more!

57
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,430
Yeah!
Yeah!

58
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,165
Nu-Uh, i'm just a better
debater than you guys!

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,935
You don't even know what you're
debating about half the time!

60
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,237
Yes, i do!
No, you don't!

61
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,707
Oh yeah? Well, screw
you guys, i'm going home!

62
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,142
Told ya.

63
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,877
Alright, children,
well unlike mr. Garrison,

64
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,948
I want you all to go out and research
this debate beforewe pick teams.

65
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,551
Tomorrow you will need
to choose which side

66
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,720
Of this poignant debate
you are on.

67
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,756
This is
about history, kids!

68
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,925
If you don't have respect
for your past,

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,660
Then you can
never expect to- Bird!

70
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,963
Then you can never expect
to have a future.

71
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,034
Nowadays, everyone wants
to change mascots and flags

72
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,769
Because they're
not "politically correct",

73
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,035
But where does
it end?

74
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,770
I mean, people are
gonna start saying

75
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,541
That the denver broncos
are offensive to horses!

76
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,276
And then we'll have to-
Squirrel!

77
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,711
And then we'll have
to change everything

78
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,880
And pretty soon, all our
history will be forgotten.

79
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,517
But toreallyunderstand the
south park flag's importance,

80
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,686
You need to know about
south park's history.

81
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,952
Ned here is
a big history buff,

82
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,240
And he can tell you
the whole story, ned?

83
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,494
In 1867, 14 pioneers
from the east coast

84
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,194
Travelled across
the plains-

85
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,530
Uh, that's okay, dude,
i think we got it.

86
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,048
Yeah, we got it.

87
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,098
You sure?
Yep.

88
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,434
You boys go
make me proud now,

89
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,169
And win that debate-
Chris peterson!

90
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,338
Aaaghgh!

91
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,507
Aw, dammit,
we missed him again!

92
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,773
Sign up to join me

93
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,109
As i march into
the mayor's office

94
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,243
In protest of
the south park flag!

95
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,881
You see that, children?
Nobody wants to get involved.

96
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,448
Randy, sign up
to march with me

97
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,184
Against the south park flag
on wednesday?

98
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,220
Ooh, look, chef, you know
i'm not a racist, but, ah...

99
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,291
I just don't really feel strongly
one way or another about the flag.

100
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,894
Well, alright, marsh, you're
entitled to your own opinion.

101
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,160
That's how it is
in this town.

102
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,364
I haven't gotten one
signature on this damn sheet

103
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,899
And i've been here
all day!

104
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,365
We'll march
with you, chef.

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,569
That's nice, but i need the
support of some registered voters!

106
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,172
Hey mackey, sign up
to march on wednesday?

107
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,306
Ooh, wednesday?
Wednesday's tough.

108
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,943
I guess maybe i could do
something thursday afternoon.

109
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,695
Alright, fudge it,
thursday!

110
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,378
Anyone else
wanna go thursday?

111
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,148
Thursday's no good,
we've got choir council.

112
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,450
Oh yeah.
What about next sunday?

113
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,150
Fine!
Next sunday!

114
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,486
You mean during
the ball game?

115
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,787
Yeah, we can't do sunday.

116
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,054
Monday?

117
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,824
Ooh, i can't do monday.
I could do tuesday.

118
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,524
Yeah, tuesday
morning's good.

119
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,161
You know what would be better
for me is saturday afternoon.

120
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,861
Saturday is
perfect for me!

121
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,632
Yeah, how about
saturday at 11:30?

122
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,765
Yeah.
Sounds good. Okay.

123
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,535
Yeah, i think
that's the best day.

124
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,669
Okay, on saturday
we march!

125
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,439
Ooh, march?
What are we marching for?

126
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,608
To bring down
the south park flag!

127
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,874
Oooh!

128
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,512
See you later.
Marching's not for me.

129
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,381
Well, i've counted all
your secret ballots, children

130
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,019
And it looks like about half of
you think the flag should stay,

131
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:48,152
And half think the flag
should be changed.

132
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,224
How could any of you think that
flag should stay the way it is!

133
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,924
Save it for
the debate, wendy!

134
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,659
Now, i'm going to assign
the debate leaders.

135
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,297
Who wants to lead the "flag
should stay the way it is" team?

136
00:04:57,332 --> 00:04:58,563
Me, me!
Me, me!

137
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,732
Stan, how could you
be so insensitive?

138
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,502
What, dude? I don't see
anything wrong with that flag.

139
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,202
Yeah, me neither!

140
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,972
Alright stan and kyle, you
can both be the team leaders

141
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,106
For the "flag should stay
the way it is" team.

142
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,045
Now who wants to lead for the
"flag should be changed" team?

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,311
Heh-Heh-Heh.

144
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,948
Okay, wendy and eric
can team up.

145
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,649
No!
Heh-Heh-Heh.

146
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,950
Alright children,
do your homework

147
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,154
And let's get ready
for a great debate!

148
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,258
Hello, chef!
Hello, chef!

149
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,793
My name isn't "chef"
anymore, children.

150
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,926
I've converted
to islam. Islam?

151
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,997
From now on my name is "abdul
mohammed jabar rauf kareem ali".

152
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,034
With everyone in town being
so insensitive about the flag,

153
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,637
I find it no longer fitting
to use my slave name!

154
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,771
Well, we need help
with our debate club.

155
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,541
We have to explain why we think
the flag should not be changed.

156
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:42,807
You what?

157
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,577
You don't think they should
change the flag?

158
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,746
Not really.
What the big deal is.

159
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,281
Well that figures
you don't.

160
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:49,747
Because your
cracker-Ass parents

161
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,350
Turned you into little
cracker-Ass cracker-Racists!

162
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,421
I never thought i'd live to see this
many of the people i considered friends

163
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,121
Turn against me!

164
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,658
But chef, we don't know what
you're talking about-

165
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,744
But nothin'!
But my ass!

166
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,795
Fix your own
damn food!

167
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,434
Okay, now, in order for us to win the
debate to change the south park flag,

168
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,134
We will need to do
a lot of research.

169
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,904
Now, my plan is to divide up
into three research teams.

170
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,639
We will present
our argument based on-

171
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,392
It's okay,
i'm here!

172
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,075
Nice of you
to show up.

173
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,278
We were just discussing
how we should state our case.

174
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,814
Yes, this is
a difficult case.

175
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,280
In order to win
the debate

176
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,050
We'll need to attack
stan and kyle's credibility.

177
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,316
What?

178
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,485
That's how you win
these things!

179
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,123
Butters, take some kids and go dig up
whatever dirt you can on kyle's past.

180
00:06:30,158 --> 00:06:31,858
I'm talking "boobie"
magazines, whatever.

181
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,124
Wu-Okay!

182
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,425
The rest of you,
get us the goods on stan.

183
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,195
His mom grounded him once
for setting something on fire,

184
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,514
Let's find out what
that something was-

185
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,798
And then lie and
say it was a puppy!

186
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,316
Right!

187
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,366
Mmm!

188
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,437
Cartman, we can't just attack
stan and kyle's credibility!

189
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,137
We need to present
our side of the debate!

190
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,341
You're right, we'll need to look
like we've prepared a case too,

191
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,076
So that they look
all the weaker, good plan.

192
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,377
So... what's
the issue again?

193
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,077
The south park flag!

194
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,281
Interesting...
and what side are we on?

195
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,582
Aaaghgh!

196
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,282
Whoa, calm down, ho!

197
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,920
Tom, i'm standing out front of
the south park mayor's office,

198
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,089
Where both sides
of this debate have gathered.

199
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,390
Change the flag!

200
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,691
Don't change history!

201
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,392
Oh brother,
what now?

202
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,897
Earlier today, the south park
townspeople voiced their opinions...

203
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:12,597
Well, i think that
the flag is racist.

204
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,017
But then again, it is
a part of our history.

205
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:17,403
Well, i guess the flag
is a part of history,

206
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,006
But i can see
how it is racist.

207
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,175
I think it is history,

208
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,742
I think it is racist.

209
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,345
Well, one thing's for sure,
tensions are high

210
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,416
And pressure is mounting on the
south park mayor to do something.

211
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,923
In the 1960s, there was a monk
who set himself on fire to protest!

212
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,056
You have left me
no choice!

213
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,694
To protest your lack
of humanity,

214
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,297
I will now do
the same thing!

215
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,237
White power! White power! White power!

216
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,937
What's this?

217
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,575
Ah, tom it looks as if the kkk has
shown up to voice their opinion!

218
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,611
Hello, brother, we are here
to support your noble cause!

219
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,231
Huh? Hey now...
we don't want your support.

220
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:03,816
We're not racists,
this is about history.

221
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,117
Yeah!

222
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,887
Well, whether you want our
support or not, we're on your side!

223
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,021
White power!

224
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,756
White power!

225
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,058
White power!

226
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,528
Mr. Garrison,
you're a klan member?

227
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,263
No, no,
but mr. Hat is.

228
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,432
White power!
White power!

229
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,034
Ugh, you're such a
racist bastard, mr. Hat!

230
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,336
White power!

231
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,602
Change the flag!

232
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,155
Don't change history!

233
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,673
Oh jesus,
what a mess.

234
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,614
Chef, we realize that you find
the south park flag racist,

235
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,747
And we certainly
understand your case.

236
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,916
We have been working
diligently on this problem,

237
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,554
Put in a lot of hours and we
have finally altered the flag

238
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,723
In a way that we think
will make you very happy.

239
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,024
Gentlemen?

240
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,928
There,
is that better?

241
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,194
No, dammit!

242
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,964
No, but look, he's got
a little smile now.

243
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,302
See? He's happy, much
better, don't you think?

244
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,206
Well, some people just won't
work with you at all!

245
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,906
This is getting
out of hand,

246
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,544
How do i absolve myself of
any responsibility with this?

247
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,677
Mayor, the south park
elementary children

248
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,315
Are discussing the flag issue
in their debate club on friday.

249
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,785
We could use the debate as an
excuse to hold a vote on the issue.

250
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,653
Yes, of course!

251
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,353
Let the children
be responsible!

252
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,522
Everybody loves children!
Tell the press!

253
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,027
South park elementary will be
holding a vote on friday!

254
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,594
This might
come in handy.

255
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,364
It says here that recently
a case was brought before

256
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,099
The south carolina courts
about their flag.

257
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,366
I warn you,
bog monster.

258
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,702
Do not mock
captain candycorn!

259
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,270
Oh yeah? How'd you like i
should kick you in the nuts?

260
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,907
If we could show a parallel
between the south carolina case...

261
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,642
Oomf! Oh yeah?
I'll kick you in the nuts!

262
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,544
Oomf! I'll kick you
in the nuts!

263
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,644
I'll kick you
in the nuts!

264
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,980
Cartman, why don't you
just go home?

265
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,366
You aren't helping any!
You won't let me help!

266
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,443
That's because you're stupid
and you're a racist.

267
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:47,486
Touche, but dude, you might
as well let me help you,

268
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,753
We're in this together.

269
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,957
I mean, just tell me
what to do and i'll do it.

270
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,825
Wendy, let cartman help,
seriously.

271
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,764
Wendy, seriously,
the bog monster speaketh.

272
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,332
Okay, so since
my dad's a lawyer,

273
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,536
He says we can use any of his books
we want, who wants to read them?

274
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,705
Come on, you guys, we all
have to work on this!

275
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,307
Kenny, how many of my dad's
mints are you gonna eat, jesus?

276
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,175
Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

277
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,875
I know your family's poor,

278
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,645
But you can't just eat an
entire bowl of mints for dinner!

279
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,911
Mprh you.

280
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,814
I don't think we stand
a chance in this debate

281
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,514
Because wendy's
leading the other side.

282
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,850
Dude, you're just saying that
'cause she's your girlfriend.

283
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,550
Mprm rmph rm rmph rm?

284
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah you can have a drink of
water, the dispenser's over there.

285
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,489
Yeah, you must be thirsty
after eating sixty mints!

286
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,224
Hey boys, how's
the research coming?

287
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,490
Pretty good,
i guess.

288
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,827
Do you think they should
change the flag?

289
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,128
Oh, uh, i don't know.

290
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,828
Kenny ate
all the mints, dad.

291
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,598
Oh, those weren't mints,
they were antacid tablets.

292
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,864
Oh.

293
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,635
Kenny!
Kenny! Kenny!

294
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,914
That was a good one!

295
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,649
White power!
White power!

296
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,588
Do not change the flag,
it is a symbol of white power!

297
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:56,889
White power!

298
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,023
Ugh, i'm sorry, chef.

299
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,793
Mr. Hat is a racist
son-Of-A-Bitch.

300
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,829
Don't apologize for me
to that spearchucker!

301
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,566
Wagh!

302
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,770
How can you all just stand by
and let these racists do this?

303
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,938
Well, chef,
it's freedom of speech.

304
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,940
We don't like it, but we can't
arrest them for talking.

305
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,577
Should the klan be allowed to
rally on the steps of the capitol?

306
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,330
Here's what
some people think.

307
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:22,013
Well, i think
they are racist,

308
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,650
But i do think freedom
of speech is important.

309
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,270
Well i for one, believe in
freedom of speech,

310
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:29,855
But then again, i think
they are racists...

311
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,658
I believe that they are
racists, but i do believe in-

312
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,026
Aw, to hell with all of you
indecisive bastards!

313
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,663
On friday, south park elementary
will present a debate

314
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,283
And after the debate,
there will finally be a vote.

315
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:42,868
Preliminary polls show 3
in favor of changing the flag,

316
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,139
3 against changing the flag
and 4,382 undecided.

317
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:49,340
So the pressure is on
those south park kids!

318
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,977
Well, that's enough rallying
for this afternoon, members!

319
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,678
Let's take
a hot shower.

320
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,881
Hot shower!
Hot shower! Hot shower!

321
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,015
Ned, nobody's gonna
vote for our side

322
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,219
If it's the side those
kkk members are on!

323
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,388
Come on, we gotta
put a stop to them!

324
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,823
I can't believe it,
all the pressure's on us.

325
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,461
I mean, this debate is going to
actually affect the outcome of the vote!

326
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,161
Uh-Huh.

327
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,798
Oh man, we've got to come up with
rebuttals to the history argument.

328
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,967
Why don't we just talk
huh? About the swastika?

329
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,136
I mean, germany was united
under the swastika, right?

330
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,836
But obviously, history
wasn't as important

331
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,474
As changing their views after the
war and stuff, so they changed it.

332
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,209
Hey, that's
a pretty good point, cartman.

333
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,909
Yeah!

334
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,113
Not bad at all, i'm gonna
make that our first argument!

335
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:27,945
Cool.

336
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,715
Doublestuff cookies
are my favorite!

337
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,981
Really?
Mine too!

338
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,283
What i really
like to do

339
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,018
Is i like to take tops
off of two cookies,

340
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,222
And then put them together
and make quadruple stuffs!

341
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,957
Hey, that's what
i always to do too!

342
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,657
No way!
Yeah!

343
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,861
Jesus, i never thought i'd have any
thing in common with you, cartman.

344
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:42,728
Me neither!

345
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,428
Ha-Ha.
Huh.

346
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,765
Well, anyway, let's
get back to work.

347
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,465
Whoa.

348
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,633
Weird, um, okay.

349
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,139
Now let's say that first we talk
about the history of the flag.

350
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,307
We can show that the-

351
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,994
Sorry, go ahead.

352
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,478
No, you go ahead.

353
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,248
Mr. Hat, what do you
think you're doing?

354
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,416
There's another
klan rally tonight.

355
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,117
I have to be there
in fifteen minutes.

356
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,622
Oh no, mr. Hat, you are not
dragging me to another klan meeting.

357
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:11,791
But they're electing a new
assistant to the grand dragon.

358
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,491
I might get elected!

359
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,827
Well, good for you,
puppet pants!

360
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,128
I'll have nothing
to do with it!

361
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,863
I'm going whether
you like it or not!

362
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,130
Oh yeah?

363
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,550
I'm not going, mr. Hat,
and that's final.

364
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,936
Let's just see you try
and go without me!

365
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,504
Mr. Hat!

366
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,575
White power! White power!
White power!

367
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,576
Alright, ned, we've got
to be careful.

368
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,346
These are mean, evil men
we are dealing with.

369
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,046
Okay.

370
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,817
Dammit, ned, doesn't that
thing have a volume control?

371
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:38,649
No.

372
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,419
White power!
White power!

373
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,119
Good evening,
brothers!

374
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,889
Our first order
of business tonight

375
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,359
Is to have brother anderson
update us on last week's minutes.

376
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:51,228
Last week we decided that
we hate blacks and jews.

377
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:56,035
Alright, and now, it is time for
us all to come together and...

378
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,787
Do our cake raffle!

379
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,470
Ooh!
Cake raffle!

380
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,107
This week's winner is...

381
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,543
2-9-7-4.

382
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,180
I won! I won!
I won the cake!

383
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,349
Good job,
brother!

384
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,061
Cartman!

385
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,953
Say it will be
like this forever.

386
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:32,905
Okay, it will be
like this forever.

387
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,640
Oh, cartman.

388
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,676
Agh!

389
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,014
Brrrrrrrr!
What's wrong with me?

390
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,822
It's okay,
get a grip, girl.

391
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,593
Wendy!

392
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,129
Wendy!

393
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:57,764
Agh!

394
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,330
Wendy.

395
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,702
Oh god, please don't
let this be happening.

396
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,437
Alright, brothers,
listen up!

397
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,908
As you know, this fine city
is holding a vote

398
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,094
On whether or not
to change their flag,

399
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,271
But lynching minorities
is history!

400
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,379
So what are we
gonna do about it?

401
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,450
Let's say that if they change the
flag, we'll burn down the capital!

402
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,185
Yeah!
Yeah!

403
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,089
Let's say that if they change the
flag, we'll never leave this town!

404
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,789
Yeah!
Yeah!

405
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,861
Let's say they should
change the flag!

406
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,561
What's that, brother?

407
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,296
I think we should
switch sides!

408
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,465
Me too,
that's a good idea.

409
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,634
Look, we have to
accept the fact

410
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,404
That most people in the
world hate us, right?

411
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

412
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,405
So whatever side
we're on,

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,175
Is the side that's
gonna lose, right?

414
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,476
Right. Right.

415
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,079
So why don't we all say
that we want the flag changed.

416
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,248
That way, most folks will vote
to keep it the way it is!

417
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,417
Great idea, brother!

418
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,152
Yeah! Yeah!

419
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,852
Alright, it is decided!

420
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,489
We will officially tell everyone
that we want the flag changed,

421
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,658
So that they will all
vote against us!

422
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,358
Hooray!

423
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,660
We're smart!

424
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,395
That worked
perfectly, ned!

425
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,130
Alright, well, now that
all that's out of the way,

426
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,635
It's time to play "who's got the
silliest thing on under their robe?"

427
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,237
Hooray!
Woo-Hoo!

428
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,684
Jesus, ned, these guys
are completely nuts.

429
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,419
Yup.

430
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,709
That is the most insane
thing i've ever seen.

431
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,095
I can't believe those
people are on our side.

432
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,830
I mean, is our side
that crazy?

433
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,601
Oh, hello, chef, big
debate tomorrow, i guess.

434
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,602
Oh jesus, the robes!

435
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,806
Chef, this isn't what it looks
like! You gotta listen to us-

436
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,541
I ain't gonna listen
to nothing!

437
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,012
This whole cracker-Ass town
can kiss my ass!

438
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,217
Ned, i'm startin' to think maybe
history ain't worth defending sometimes.

439
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,519
Thanks for
coming over, bebe.

440
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,723
I have something to
tell you. Sure, what?

441
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,326
Bebe, i'm attracted
to cartman.

442
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,928
Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh!

443
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,195
I know.

444
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,496
Why would you
tell me this?

445
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,049
Why would you
tell anyone this?

446
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,532
Because i don't know
what to do!

447
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,736
I can't concentrate and
if i can't concentrate,

448
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,003
Then i can't win
the debate tomorrow!

449
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,640
The whole vote is dependent
on me doing a good job.

450
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:22,906
Alright, look,

451
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,641
When two people work
closely for a long time,

452
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,810
Sometimes they feel what's
called "sexual tension".

453
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,014
Sometimes you just have to act on
the impulse and get it over with.

454
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,749
You mean,
i should kiss him?

455
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,484
Kiss him and get it
out of your system.

456
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,219
Oh god!

457
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,123
Well, i certainly would like
to thank all the parents

458
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,823
For their support
of our debate club.

459
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,461
I realize that many of you are
torn by the issues as well,

460
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,064
So perhaps the children
can shed some light on us!

461
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:47,900
We'll start with
wendy testaburger,

462
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,702
On the "flag should
be changed" team!

463
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,077
The, the, uh...

464
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:02,414
The, uh...

465
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,487
The first argument
we, uh...

466
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,656
Lemme start over.

467
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,356
The, uh... oh god!

468
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,560
Could you all excuse me
for a moment?

469
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,705
There, now, the main point
we would like to make

470
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,308
Is that oftentimes, it is
prudent to change history.

471
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,008
As times change,
we hope to grow,

472
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,743
And as we grow,
our rules must change,

473
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,947
It is a natural part
of evolution, thank you.

474
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,453
Okay, and kyle and stan's team,
your main point?

475
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,756
Our main point is that the
flag shouldn't offend anyone

476
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,960
Because killing has been around
since the beginning of time.

477
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,226
All animals kill

478
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,996
And the animals that
don't kill are stupid ones,

479
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,297
Like cows and
turtles and stuff.

480
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,466
So, people should not be
so upset about killing.

481
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,201
Thank you.

482
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,671
Woah, woah, woah! You just
missed the point entirely!

483
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,371
Huh?

484
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,142
I'm not mad because the flag
shows somebody getting killed,

485
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,877
It's because
it's racist!

486
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,577
Racist?
Racist?

487
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,179
Children, don't you even know
what this argument is about?

488
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,817
That flag is racist because a black
man is being hung by white people!

489
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,986
Ooohhhh!
Ooohhhh!

490
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,252
Ooohhhh?

491
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,022
We didn't really
see it that way.

492
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,722
But that's a black man
up there!

493
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,360
Yeah, but the color of
someone's skin doesn't matter.

494
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,529
Well, of course
it matters when-

495
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:27,397
Oh my god,
wait a minute!

496
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,168
You children didn't
even see the flag

497
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,770
As a black man being hanged
by white people, did you?

498
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,036
No. No.

499
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,771
Why that is...

500
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,843
That is the most beautiful
thing i've ever heard.

501
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,378
What?
What?

502
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,844
Don't you see?

503
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,048
All this time i thought these
little crackers had turned racist,

504
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,616
When actually,
they were sonotracist

505
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,555
That they didn't even make a separation
of black and white to begin with.

506
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,723
All they saw when
they looked at that flag

507
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,458
Was five people.

508
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,744
Aw!

509
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,596
Yeah.

510
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,965
I'm sorry, children,
i was wrong about you.

511
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,134
But i still think the flag
needs to be changed.

512
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,736
But now i realize that
i almost let racism

513
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,471
Turn me into a racist.

514
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,942
Yeah, you know, i suddenly found
myself on the side of klan members.

515
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,544
I've never had anything
against blacks, chef.

516
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,845
Aw, i know you don't, jimbo.

517
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,581
I've known you for
almost ten years.

518
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:16,847
You're a good man.

519
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,834
We've been way to divisive
over this, chef.

520
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,786
Maybe we can come up
with a compromise flag.

521
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,353
Something that everybody
can be happy with.

522
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,991
I think that's a much better start
than me trying to separate myself

523
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,426
From all you
wonderful crackers!

524
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,630
Oh, sweet, dude, i don't think we
have to do this stupid debate now!

525
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,365
Stan?

526
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,136
Well, this has been an
interesting week in south park.

527
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:40,704
We've all done a lot
of growing this week.

528
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,775
Everyone was afraid to
take a stand on this issue.

529
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,510
But now we have learned
once again

530
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,547
That black, white, yellow, brown
or whatever, we are all just people.

531
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,149
And so, i am very excited
to unveil

532
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,318
Our new south park flag!

533
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,922
Wait, i don't get it.

534
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,259
No, see, there's people
of all colors.

535
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,861
And they added a black guy as one of
the hangers too, so it's not racist.

536
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,729
Hooray!

537
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,862
I have to admit it,
that is a lot nicer.

538
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,899
Whew! I'm sure glad
that's over with! Me too!

539
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,970
I can't believe how right bebe was about
feeling under pressure with somebody.

540
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,139
As soon as it was over, all my
feelings for you just vanished!

541
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,707
Oh, yeah,
yeah totally.

542
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,910
I'm totally back to normal,
see ya later!

543
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,212
Yeah, see ya later.

544
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,513
"Ho", huh-Huh.

545
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,779
Ha-Ha!

546
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,983
Stan!
Stan wait up!
