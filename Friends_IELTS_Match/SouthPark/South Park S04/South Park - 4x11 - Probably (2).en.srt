1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,410
Today, we are going
to talk about hell!

2
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,446
Hello, satan!

3
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,181
Saddam.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,916
Us jews don't
believe in hell.

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,218
But what if
we're wrong?

6
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:19,719
Let's go!

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,087
They killed kenny!

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,822
He had sins that
he didn't confess!

9
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,327
No, saddam, i told you,
i'm with chris now.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,496
Boys, it is your
christian duty

11
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,231
To save the souls
of your friends.

12
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,497
I love you, satan.

13
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,833
I love you too, saddam.

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,568
Agh! Agh!

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,171
Fonz, there is no way you can jump
that shark with your waterskis!

16
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,906
Ay, i've gotta try,
richie!

17
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:42,474
Ooh!

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,244
Dude, if this guy's
going to hell?

19
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:45,510
Who's gonna save us?

20
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,846
Well, it looks like
we're gonna have to save

21
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,581
Everyone in this town
ourselves!

22
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:49,883
Go fonz!

23
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,583
Aaaayyyy-

24
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,220
And now the exciting conclusion
of "south park"!

25
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,972
Aayyyyy!

26
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,690
Aaghgh!

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,727
I told him
he couldn't do it.

28
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,933
I am saying this because
we must be saved-A!

29
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,005
The lord is powerful
and he will smote the sinners

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,191
And send them
to everlasting hell-A!

31
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:16,342
If you do not live
your life for him-A!

32
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,945
Then to the lake of fire
you shall go-A!

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,645
You see that, parents?

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,283
Your children have refused to come
in to class since this morning!

35
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:25,885
I'm afraid your son
is the leader, ms. Cartman.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,585
Apparently he's read
the entire bible

37
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,789
And now he's scaring
the hell out of everyone.

38
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,489
Poopie-Kins!

39
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,127
It's time to stop preaching
damnation to everyone, sweetie.

40
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,296
Don't you guys, um...

41
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,465
Persercrute our
religious beliefs!

42
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,332
Yeah!
Yeah!

43
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,284
We're not trying to
persecute you, kids.

44
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,802
But you're supposed
to be in school!

45
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,069
What purpose
does school have?

46
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,405
The bible says
the only goal in this life

47
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,105
Is to praise god and
get into heaven!

48
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,742
Yeah, this life is short,
the afterlife is forever!

49
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,345
Don't listen to them, kids,
you have to go to school!

50
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,479
Many of you knew
kenny mckormick.

51
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,683
He was a playful, school-Going
eight-Year-Old.

52
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:57,550
And then yesterday...

53
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,719
He was smacked down
by the lord-A!

54
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,755
God bitch slapped him right
to the fiery depths of hell!

55
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,057
So when will you go?

56
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,792
Tomorrow, ten years?
Does it matter?

57
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,058
No!

58
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,828
Because unless you give
this life to the lord,

59
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,563
That life belongs
to satan!

60
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,263
Agh!
Agh!

61
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,467
But we cannot worship god
in that church

62
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,768
Where the priest
of sin resides!

63
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,469
So we will build
a new church!

64
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,672
With crystal walls,
a ceiling eighty-Feet high,

65
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,709
And a slide that connects this
part myha to this part mhya!

66
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,010
Who will help us!

67
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,528
I will!
I will!

68
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,613
Praise god-A!

69
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,204
If i go spend the night
with saddam,

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,156
Then it's over
between me and chris.

71
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,289
Chris has been
so nice to me.

72
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,927
And i know saddam will
just hurt me again.

73
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:43,530
Maybe i'll just
go talk to saddam.

74
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,433
I need closure, yeah,
that's it, i need closure.

75
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,134
What am i doing?

76
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,904
What took ya
so long, baby?

77
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,506
Saddam, i'm just
here to talk.

78
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,543
Great, let's talk!

79
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,110
Mmm, this bed
is comfy-Womfy!

80
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,531
Saddam, i only came here
because i need closure.

81
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,917
Sounds fun, you know me,
i'll try anything!

82
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:05,235
No, saddam,
listen to me-

83
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,519
Would you like a drink?

84
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:09,556
Maybe just a little one,
i have to go back soon.

85
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,592
I need you to understand that
we can't be together anymore.

86
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,761
I need you tonot
come by the condo,

87
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,461
Andnottry
to see me.

88
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,098
Chris thinks we can all
be friends, but i don't.

89
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,833
And i have to focus
on chris now.

90
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,534
What is this?

91
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,737
These hotels have all kinds
of crazy channels.

92
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,039
Saddam, will you
listen to me?

93
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,305
Chris is
a great person!

94
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,040
He is the one i want
to be with now!

95
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,678
Really, so then
what are you doing here?

96
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,245
I don't know about you,

97
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,449
But this video is
gettin' me pretty hot.

98
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,282
Saddam...

99
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,919
Here, have another drink.

100
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,426
Ugh, oh god,
my head!

101
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,462
I drank too much...
chris?

102
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,728
Oh no!

103
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,199
Man, look at that!

104
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,402
We went through fourteen
bottles of vegetable oil!

105
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,669
Ooh, i'm all greasy!

106
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,439
Oh god,
what time is it?

107
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,139
Last night was awesome!

108
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,692
Aren't we
together again now?

109
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,175
I don't know,
i guess so.

110
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,945
But now i have to go home
and tell chris.

111
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,645
Screw him!

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,283
No, saddam, i at least
owe him an explanation.

113
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,452
I just don't know
what i'm gonna say.

114
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,356
I know how to solve
this little problem.

115
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,958
We are now entering ensenada,

116
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,960
The second largest city
on the mexican baja peninsula.

117
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,031
We have now traveled over 2000
miles since leaving new york city!

118
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,165
We'll just be stopping here
for a few moments for gas

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,236
And then our tour will continue
on to its final destination!

120
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,370
Oiga, hay algo pegado
bajo el autobus!

121
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,441
Que? What's stuck to
the bottom of the bus?

122
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,443
Hmph!

123
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,779
Oh, goodness.

124
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,948
We must have run over a little
mexican further up north.

125
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,266
Is it okay?

126
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,515
Pienso que si.

127
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,021
Well, here's fifty
for the gas,adios!

128
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,189
Where am i?
Que?

129
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,792
Where am i?
Que?

130
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,866
It is beautiful.

131
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,601
Thine church is
almost completeth.

132
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,371
There's no way god would
want to send us to hell now!

133
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,106
Yeah this church
kicks a-

134
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,425
It, it kicks.

135
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,674
Hello, boys.

136
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,010
Don't try to take me
away again, mom and dad!

137
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,745
I told you, i renounced
the jewish faith!

138
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,445
It's not that, kyle.

139
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,083
It's just that eric's mother
needs to see you all right away.

140
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:20,553
Just really quick, she says
it's very important.

141
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,253
Very well,
yea, guys,

142
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,891
Let us walk to mine home
and see what mine mom wants.

143
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:28,361
I sure hope this works.

144
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,362
Hello, kiddies!

145
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,434
I made you all powdered-Donut
pancake surprise!

146
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,700
Wow, cool!

147
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,036
No, it is a trick!

148
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,771
Do not vex me,
oh temptress!

149
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,073
What?

150
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,024
This is a distraction
from our work on the church!

151
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,543
Do not think that you can
tempt us with toys...

152
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,844
And games...

153
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,230
And tidings of powdered-Donut
pancake surprise!

154
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,182
For it is the afterlife
we concern ourselves with!

155
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,567
Not the pleasures
on this earth!

156
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,519
But salvation
in the world after!

157
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,786
Yeah!

158
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,989
Oh, well,
alrighty then.

159
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,725
I don't think it worked.

160
00:05:59,158 --> 00:05:59,991
Aw!
Aw!

161
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,761
Let us get back to
our work at the church.

162
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,797
Yea, i shall answer
the phone-Na.

163
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:05,665
Hello?

164
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,267
Mprh mprm rm
rmph rm rmph!

165
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,967
Oh my god!
What?

166
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,171
It's kenny, he's calling
from beyond the grave!

167
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,039
Kenny?
What's he say!

168
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,305
Ask him what
hell is like!

169
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,858
Kenny, you have to
tell us about hell!

170
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:17,377
Give us every last
horrible detail!

171
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,545
Um...

172
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,184
Oh god, chris is gonna be
so mad at me!

173
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,486
Well, here goes...

174
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,220
Hey, you.

175
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,487
Hi, chris.

176
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,558
You...
were out all night.

177
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,825
Yeah, i just...

178
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,028
Spent the night walking
around the marina.

179
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,065
Satan, you know you're
not a very good liar.

180
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,800
You went and saw saddam,
didn't you?

181
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,066
Yes.

182
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,704
Satan...
i understand.

183
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:45,536
What?

184
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,740
I still feel secure
and safe with you.

185
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,041
Oh, no!

186
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,210
What, what's wrong?
I said it's okay.

187
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,078
I know!

188
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,778
Well, what more
do you want from me?

189
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,982
Well, could you not be
such a pussy about it?

190
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,116
I mean,
can't you just say

191
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,536
"If you ever see saddam again
i'll break your legs"

192
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,922
Or "i'm gonna go kick
saddam's ass" or something?

193
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,056
Satan, i'm a 90s man.

194
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,260
I cry when i need to,
i share my feelings

195
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,429
And i keep my mind open
about everything.

196
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,864
Just give me some boundaries,
be jealous!

197
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,501
Go throw a football around,
for christ's sake!

198
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,236
Now you're starting
to hurt my feelings.

199
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,804
I'm sorry, chris.

200
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,875
It's not you,
really, it's me.

201
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,911
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me

202
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,514
And for some reason,
i can't just accept that.

203
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,117
Die, pussy!
Aahghgh!

204
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:31,949
Chris!

205
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,684
Saddam what the hell
are you doing?

206
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,888
There, i got rid of
the problem for you!

207
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,190
Now there's no conflict!

208
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,358
No, not like this!

209
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,033
Friends, i have to tell you
that last night,

210
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,636
I received a phone call
from beyond the grave!

211
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,239
It was our departed friend,
kenny,

212
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,939
Calling from
the depths of hell!

213
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,878
And he described what hell
is like in horrid detail!

214
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,879
He said that in hell,
the smell is awful!

215
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,384
He said that in hell,
everyone speaks spanish!

216
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,217
Aagh!
Aagh!

217
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,386
He said there
is water in hell,

218
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,457
But if you drink it, you pee
blood out your ass for seven hours!

219
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,325
No!
No!

220
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,060
And perhaps worst of all,

221
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,530
In hell, there are dozens and
dozens of little trinket stores.

222
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,132
But they all have the same
little trinkets in them!

223
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,399
Aaghgh!
Aaghgh!

224
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,735
Where is our daughter!

225
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,568
Dad?

226
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,303
Marcy, you are coming home
this instant!

227
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,940
We are saving your daughter
from the clutches of hell, sir!

228
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,543
You're not going to make
my daughter part of your cult!

229
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,278
Your daughter could
die tomorrow and then what?

230
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,881
You're just a stupid little
fat kid who thinks that-

231
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,147
Stephen?

232
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,316
Stephen, no!

233
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,051
The lord has
spoken again!

234
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,821
Oh forgive us, lord,
for our sins!

235
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,556
Forgive us lord!
Forgive us lord!

236
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,388
Let us pray!

237
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,158
Heavenly father,
do not send us to hell.

238
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,425
We're sorry.

239
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,761
Whatever we did,
we're sorry.

240
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:50,062
Stephen?

241
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,364
Stephen!

242
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,365
Where- Where am i?

243
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,569
Where are we?
Oh my god!

244
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:57,870
What's happening?

245
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,136
Aaghgh!

246
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,689
Hello newcomers
and welcome.

247
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,208
Can everybody hear me?
Hello?

248
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,960
Can everybody- Okay.

249
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,678
I'm the hell director.

250
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,582
It looks like we have about
8,615 of you newbies today.

251
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:12,618
And for those of you
who were a little confused,

252
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,186
Uh, you are dead
and this is hell.

253
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,788
So abandon all hope and
yadda-Yadda-Yadda

254
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,294
Uh, we're now going to start the orientation process which will last about
-=

255
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:22,994
Hey, wait a minute,
i shouldn't be here!

256
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,197
I was a totally strict
and devout protestant!

257
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,464
I thought we went
to heaven!

258
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,667
Yes, well, i'm afraid
you were wrong.

259
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,637
I was a practicing
jehovah's witness.

260
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:32,537
You picked
the wrong religion, as well.

261
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,307
Well, who was right?
Who gets into heaven?

262
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:36,475
I'm afraid it was
themormons.

263
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,078
Yes, themormons
were the correct answer.

264
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,344
Aw!
Aw!

265
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,079
So now, i'd like to
quickly introduce

266
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,585
Your new ruler and master
for eternity, satan.

267
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,320
Rrrarrghghh!

268
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,586
Aaaahghgh!
Aaaahghgh!

269
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,188
Now you are all
part of my domain!

270
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,260
Every day hell grows larger
and my minions...

271
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,695
My minions...

272
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,333
I'm sorry, i just
can't do this today.

273
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,935
I'm just-
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,008
Uh, okay,
thank you satan.

275
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,274
Satan!

276
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,611
Excuse me, excuse me.

277
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,744
Chris, but i thought
you were dead!

278
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,165
Yeah, well, where was
i gonna go, detroit?

279
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,551
Chris i didn't mean for
saddam to stab you-

280
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:19,817
Hey, it's alright.

281
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,587
All that matters is
that i'm back

282
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,322
And we're together
forever, right?

283
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,792
Uh, yeah, great.

284
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,527
Aw!
Aw!

285
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,830
Let's see,
matthew 15:1-1.

286
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,467
"Not that which goeth
into the mouth defileth a man,

287
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,070
But that which come out
of the mouth defileth a man."

288
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,805
That's a good one,
clyde frog, interesting.

289
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,540
Look, eric, sister anne
has come to visit you.

290
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,492
Yea, it is nice
to see you, sister,

291
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,011
But i must prepare
for my next sermon.

292
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,144
Eric, you need to stop
what you're doing.

293
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,348
You need to tell all the kids
to go back to school

294
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,100
And back to their
normal lives.

295
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:52,844
Sister, have you read
this book?

296
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,553
Yes, eric, a lot more
than you have.

297
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,457
Then you know what it says happens
to those that don't follow the lord-A.

298
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,060
Eric, the lord doesn't just
send everybody to hell.

299
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,326
That wouldn't make sense.

300
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,061
He wants people
to live their lives.

301
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,831
Are you saying that what
the bible says isn't true?

302
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,098
No!

303
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,833
We've got jews
and perverts and bullies

304
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,820
And all kinds of sinners
in this town, sister anne-A.

305
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,772
And without the priest, we've
decided to save ourselves.

306
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,808
The only ones the kids
can trust now are me and jesus!

307
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,508
Ugh!

308
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,243
Wait a minute,
that's it!

309
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,881
And i am going to save
all of you right now!

310
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,050
I am going to
heal your sins!

311
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:25,785
Whoa.

312
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,556
Hello, satan!
Oh, crap, it's you.

313
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:31,822
Yeah, it's me.

314
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,159
I thought i killed you.

315
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,425
Yeah, well-

316
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,726
Where was i gonna go,
detroit?

317
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,461
Do you have a couple minutes
to go for a walk?

318
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,533
Yeah, just real quick,
around the park or something.

319
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,667
Is this some kind of trick?

320
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,870
No, i just want you to go
for a quick walk with me.

321
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,137
Please?

322
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,340
Well, alright, just let me
grab something real quick.

323
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,943
? Da da da da daa?

324
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,847
Okay, let's walk.

325
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:57,848
Saddam,

326
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,052
I get the feeling that
you don't like me very much.

327
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,588
Gee, whatever
gave you that idea?

328
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:03,054
When i stabbed you
in the head?

329
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,040
Look, satan is a very
important person to me.

330
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,992
And i know he's an important
person to you, too.

331
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,463
So don't you think it's best
for us to try and get along?

332
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,065
I realize that some things
about me bother you,

333
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,366
So i'd like to hear
what those things are,

334
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,067
So that i can
work on them.

335
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,403
You know why
i don't like you, chris?

336
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,704
Because you're
the kind of guy,

337
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,005
Who, if somebody
didn't like him,

338
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,174
He would take them for a walk
in the park and ask them why.

339
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,577
You're a pussy!

340
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,946
Aaaaaaghhhhhh!

341
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,646
Oh god!

342
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,548
Ha ha ha ha!

343
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,850
Nooo!
Aaghhgh!

344
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,235
Agahgh!

345
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,586
Ow!

346
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,621
Blagh!

347
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,164
Today this jewish boy and all
sinners are going to be saved-A!

348
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,899
Kyle, do you
believe in god-A?

349
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,767
Yes!

350
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,502
Do you want to be
saved from hell-A?

351
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,334
Yes!

352
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,635
That's good,
because right now

353
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,405
All the jewness is
coming out of your body,

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,008
Being replaced by
the spirit of god-A!

355
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,309
Bap!
Ow!

356
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,009
Praise god,
how do you feel now?

357
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,780
Do you feel the light of god
inside of you?

358
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,081
Uh, i think so.

359
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,816
Praise the lord!

360
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,082
Yay!
Yay!

361
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,069
? For he is lord?

362
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:08,986
? He is lord?

363
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,322
Bring up the next person!

364
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,456
This boy has been
crippled with sin.

365
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,094
But i hear god saying
that this boy will walk!

366
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,395
Hallelujah!

367
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:17,661
Timmy!

368
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,963
We are gonna save you

369
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,733
And you are gonna walk
with the lord-A!

370
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:21,565
Timmy!

371
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,335
Devil be gone-A!

372
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,203
Hagh!

373
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,938
Now walk, timmy!

374
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:26,771
Hagh!

375
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,541
Come on, timmy,
get out of that chair-A!

376
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,276
The lord wants you
to walk, timmy!

377
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,011
Walk, timmy!

378
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:33,329
Timmy!

379
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,639
He walks!

380
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,945
Wow!
Wow!

381
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,216
Wagh!

382
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,916
Yes, praise the lord!

383
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,554
Praise the lord!
Praise the lord!

384
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,024
And now it's like there's
one guy who's horrible to me,

385
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,993
But i'm totally
sexually attracted to,

386
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,279
And then one guy who's
really nice to me,

387
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:51,530
But i'm not sexually
attracted to at all!

388
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:52,398
Wow, that really sucks.

389
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,133
I've asked
everybody for advice,

390
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,833
But nobody seems
to know the answer.

391
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,904
Well, there's one person who i always
used to ask when i needed advice.

392
00:13:59,338 --> 00:13:59,772
Who?

393
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,472
God.

394
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,207
God?
I can't do that.

395
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,845
I haven't spoken to god
in, like, 5,000 years.

396
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,315
Well then,
maybe it's time.

397
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,086
? Doot doot doo
doot doot doo?

398
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,472
? Doot doot doo?
? Doot doot doo?

399
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,116
? For he is lord
lord lord lord?

400
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:19,725
Where are you from,
little boy?

401
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,558
Denver.

402
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,328
And god is telling me
that you have...

403
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,629
Bad eyesight,
is that it?

404
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:24,496
Yeah, that's right!

405
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,763
Ooh!
Ooh!

406
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,750
Well god is going to
heal those eyes

407
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,702
And save you from
the devil be gone-A!

408
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,402
Hooray!
Hooray!

409
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,438
? For he is lord
lord lord lord?

410
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,292
Right here we have a little
girl who is very, very ugly.

411
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,112
Do you believe he's going to
cure your face of the uglies?

412
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:40,980
Yes!

413
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,246
He's gonna take
that ugly face

414
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,884
And make you reasonable
to look at - Bwap!

415
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,185
Wrrrrrrrr!

416
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,920
Oh good lord,
somebody say amen!

417
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,186
Amen!
Amen!

418
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,956
? Doot doot doo?

419
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,994
Hi, hi, welcome
to heaven, brother!

420
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,632
You followed the mormon faith
and so you've been let in!

421
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,818
Uh, actually,
i'm just stopping by.

422
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,562
Well, you picked
a great time!

423
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,236
We've got
cookies and punch

424
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,006
And were just about to
start playing charades!

425
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,272
Hooray!
Hooray!

426
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,007
And then brother stephen's
brought his guitar

427
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,211
So we can sing songs about
how much it hurts to lie!

428
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,477
Oooh!
Oooh!

429
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,681
Uh, look, i just need
to talk with god.

430
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:16,947
Is he around?

431
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,585
Sure, all you have to do is
say his name and he's there.

432
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,886
I'm so grateful for that.

433
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,205
Me too!
Me too!

434
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,489
Great, thanks.

435
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,826
Uh, hello, god?

436
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,032
It's uh...
satan.

437
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,671
Yea, look upon me
and know me.

438
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,503
Hi, god.

439
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,804
Hello, satan.

440
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,141
It's been
a long time.

441
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,407
Yeah.

442
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,310
What brings you here?

443
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,912
Do you wish to mount your
unholy war against heaven?

444
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,382
No, i have a problem and
i need your advice.

445
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,351
You want to rule
more than hell?

446
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,251
You want to destroy
the earth?

447
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,854
No, it's kind of
a long story but...

448
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,793
Well, it all started when this
iraqi dictator, saddam hussein,

449
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,927
Was killed by
a pack of wild boars.

450
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,130
I remember when i first
met him in hell,

451
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,733
It was a lovely morning
in april and...

452
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,336
? Oh praise the lord?

453
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,938
And now i am receiving
a message directly from god!

454
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,204
God is telling me...

455
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,276
That each and every one of you
is to walk up to this stage

456
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,410
And give me one dollar!

457
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,782
So, i want everyone to feel the
love of god by coming on up here

458
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,951
And putting a dollar
in the box-A!

459
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,337
Come on, don't be shy,
come on-A!

460
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:30,254
Dude, that seems
kind of weird.

461
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,423
Yeah, i don't remember him
saying anything aboutthis.

462
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,795
And now chris and saddam just keep
killing each other over and over

463
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,632
And i don't know
which one to pick!

464
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,434
Jesus, what the hell
happened to you?

465
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,736
Huh?

466
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,338
You got kicked outta here
for being a headstrong rebel.

467
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,741
And now you're
a whiny little bitch.

468
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:51,075
I just don't know
which one to pick!

469
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,278
No, you've become dependent
on relationships,

470
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,447
So you haven't even
consideredthe option

471
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,616
Of not being with
either of them!

472
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,785
If you're not sexually
attracted to someone,

473
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,104
You're not ever
going to be.

474
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,388
But saddam
isn't right either.

475
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,689
He's the other extreme.

476
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,823
You need to
spend time alone,

477
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,243
So that you can find
the balance the middle ground.

478
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,629
That's what i always do,
because i'm a buddhist.

479
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,930
God, you're right.

480
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,665
You know, i've had
steady relationships

481
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,366
For the last
thousand years.

482
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,101
When one ends,
i just start another one,

483
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,172
But i haven't taken the time
to be secure with myself.

484
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,907
Bingo.

485
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,475
Hey, thanks, god.

486
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,546
I forgot how clear
you make things sometimes.

487
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,281
It was nice
to see you again, satan.

488
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,600
You, too.

489
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,884
Good-Bye.

490
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,221
Would you like to stay
for some cookies and punch?

491
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,089
Yes, would you?

492
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,824
Uh, no, i need to be
getting back.

493
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,392
Oh alright then, but you're
gonna miss our big play!

494
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,897
Yes, we're going to do a play about
how alcohol can ruin family life.

495
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:49,234
Well, sounds great,
but i really gotta go.

496
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,837
Well, he seemed
like a nice fellow.

497
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,138
Yes!

498
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,741
Let's make things
out of egg cartons!

499
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,441
Ooh let's!
Good idea!

500
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,079
? Doot doot doo
doot doot doo?

501
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,681
Yeeess, yeeesss!

502
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,585
It worked, you guys,
it actually worked!

503
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,418
What worked?

504
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,719
Everybody bought
the whole act!

505
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,356
They'll keep giving and giving
until we have it all!

506
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,189
What?
What?

507
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,657
You're keeping
that money yourself?

508
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,260
Of course, you guys,
and then we can make...

509
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,394
Ten million dollars!

510
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,563
Look, the "tooth fairy"
thing didn't work,

511
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,767
The "boy band" thing didn't
last, so i tried this route.

512
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,033
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

513
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,803
You mean that this whole thing
has just been a way for you

514
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,122
To make
ten million dollars?

515
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,406
It all came to me
days ago,

516
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,106
When we were first
in sunday school.

517
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,642
But what about going
to hell and all that?

518
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,611
Dude, if god is all-Understanding.
He wouldn't send us to hell.

519
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:33,912
Even sister anne
told me that!

520
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,214
Then why didn't
you tell us?

521
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,816
My brain is of a much
larger size than you guys'.

522
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:38,684
I couldn't expect you
to understand.

523
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,818
Not until you actuallysaw
the cash flow.

524
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,021
The only thing of yours that's
larger in size is your big fat ass!

525
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,721
Suck my balls.

526
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,492
Dude, i amso
disillusioned right now.

527
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,660
Die, pussy!

528
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:49,979
Ow!

529
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:51,506
Aagh!

530
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,998
Wagahgh!

531
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,698
Aahh!

532
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,867
Guys, guys, guys!

533
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,071
Look, you both can
stop fighting now.

534
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,372
I've made a decision.

535
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,240
You have?

536
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,940
Yes, i...

537
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,144
Don't want to be with
either one of you.

538
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,143
What?
What?

539
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,711
Saddam,
you're an asshole

540
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,481
And you'll never be
the friend that i want.

541
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,615
And chris, well,
you're a pussy

542
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,784
And you'll never be
the lover i want.

543
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:19,024
So i'm just gonna be alone for
a while and learn to like myself.

544
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,193
Satan, can we go
for a walk in the park?

545
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,327
No, i'm not going
on a walk.

546
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,964
You're a pussy, chris and
you drive me crazy, go away.

547
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,231
Fine.

548
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,736
You can't leave me, satan,
i won't let you!

549
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,171
Today is another day

550
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,808
And that's another dollar
the lord needs from you-A!

551
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,977
So come on up and
give to the lord-A!

552
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,946
Alright, kids,
it's time to go!

553
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:43,232
It's time for
this to stop.

554
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,243
Sister anne is
a blasphemaaa!

555
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:47,184
I know you won't
listen to me.

556
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,388
That's why i brought
somebody else.

557
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,424
Oohh! Wow!

558
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,292
Jesus!

559
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,593
Uh-Oh.

560
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,762
Kids, you all need to stop
spending all your time here

561
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,594
And go back to school.

562
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,763
Jesus, ex-Nay
on the ool-Skay.

563
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,967
God doesn't want you to spend
all your time being afraid of hell

564
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,667
Or praising his name.

565
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,871
God wants you to spend
your time helping others

566
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,057
And living a good,
happy life.

567
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,209
That's how
you live for him.

568
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,475
Yes, by doing that...

569
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,679
And putting a dollar
in the box-A!

570
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,281
Let's go ice skating!

571
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,981
Yay!
Yay!

572
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,185
We can help timmy learn
how to ice skate, too.

573
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,018
Yeah!

574
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,222
No, come back!

575
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,824
You face
everlasting damnation!

576
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,090
Wait!

577
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,162
No, no, i can't be cheated out
of my ten million dollars again!

578
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,428
God dammit!

579
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,764
Serves you right,
cartman!

580
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,066
Yeah!

581
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,235
But, eric, i think this time
i have to teach you a lesson.

582
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,837
I'm sending you somewhere
to think about your sins!

583
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,572
You're gonna
send me to hell?

584
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,609
No, worse!

585
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,078
Eric, eric!

586
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,380
Oh crap!

587
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,984
? Da da da daa?

588
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:54,886
Hi, bob!
Hi, rick!

589
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:55,754
Hi, satan.

590
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,272
There you are!

591
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,357
Ugh, not again.

592
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,092
You know you can't
live without me!

593
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,792
Now get that ass
back to bed!

594
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,429
Saddam, i told you,
i don't need you anymore.

595
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:05,731
You can't leave me, satan.

596
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,032
Nobody leaves me!

597
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,784
Yes, i can!

598
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,467
Agahgh!

599
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,202
You little prick!

600
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,937
Goodbye forever, saddam!

601
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,239
What are you
talking about?

602
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,009
You can kill me,
but i'll be back tomorrow!

603
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,275
Not this time!

604
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,346
I asked a favor of an old
friend of mine to let you in.

605
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,081
Let me in where?

606
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,419
What the- What the hell
is this place?

607
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,685
Hello and welcome!

608
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,022
We're glad you
made it, brother!

609
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,288
Who the hell are you?

610
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,624
We're just about
to do a play

611
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,227
About how much stealing
hurts you deep inside.

612
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,545
Come join us!
Let's go!

613
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,829
You're here forever!

614
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,096
No!

615
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,866
Noooooooooooo!
