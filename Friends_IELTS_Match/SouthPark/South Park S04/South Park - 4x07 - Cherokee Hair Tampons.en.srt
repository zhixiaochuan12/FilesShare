without temptation?

? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,603
Good morning, children,
mr. Garrison is away today.

15
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:38,338
I am your
substitute teacher,

16
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,472
Mr. Wyland.

17
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,207
Oh sweet, dude,
substitute teacher.

18
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,977
Now, i understand that
some students in this class

19
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,111
Like tomesswith
substitute teachers,

20
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,713
But if we all behave
and respect each other,

21
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,351
I'm sure we can make this
a fun and productive day.

22
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:54,387
Let's start with
roll call, let's see...

23
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,122
Eric cartman.
Here.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,798
Alright and how about
stan marsh.

25
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,665
Here.

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,703
It's notthatfunny,
guys, jesus!

27
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,208
Okay, and where is
kenny mccormick?

28
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,076
Here.

29
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,678
Ha ha!
Ha ha! Ha ha!

30
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,246
Oh, oh, ow!

31
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,981
Dude, what the hell
is that?

32
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,618
Dude, you know when you're laughing
so hard that milk comes out your nose.

33
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,318
Oh, man!

34
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,921
Dude, you weren't
huh? Drinking any milk.

35
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,691
You have to bedrinkingmilk
for that to happen.

36
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:32,524
Not with me, man.

37
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,294
All right, look,
why don't we skip roll call.

38
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,595
Here is what we're
going to do today.

39
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,764
I've been told that
one of your classmates

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,065
Has been ill
for several days,

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,384
Kyle broflofski.

42
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:41,633
He's fakin'.

43
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,802
Well, i've been told
in mr. Garrison's absence,

44
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,307
That our activity for the day is
to make a "get well" card for kyle.

45
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,042
So i've got this
large piece of posterboard

46
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,078
And we're all going to come up and
use glitter and glue to decorate it.

47
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,397
Ah!
Ah!

48
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,646
He's faking.

49
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,151
Kenny, you come and decorate
the "get well" card too.

50
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,487
But, i don't want kyle
to get well, i hate kyle.

51
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,939
I don't care,
get down here and do it!

52
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,356
Hey watch it, hey,
what are you doing?

53
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,392
Now, that's
a "get well" card.

54
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,561
Ha ha!
Ha ha! Ha ha!

55
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,165
Mr. Garrison,
after very careful review,

56
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,237
The school board believes
that you should take a...

57
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,405
Hiatus from teaching,
indefinitely.

58
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,707
What?

59
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,708
Frankly, your conduct has been
somewhatdisconcerting.

60
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,779
Did you know that not one of your
students knew who sam adams was?

61
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,965
Well, who cares about
a guy that makes beer?

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,082
Jesus christ, i'm trying
to teach history!

63
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:35,455
Frankly, mr. Garrison, it isn't
even your educational record

64
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,756
That we're most
concerned about,

65
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,792
It's your somewhat
substantial police record.

66
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,528
Oh, whatever!

67
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,431
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of
attempting to solicit sex from a minor...

68
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,600
That was not me,
that was mr. Hat.

69
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,637
All we're saying is perhaps you should
take a little hiatus from teaching

70
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:54,974
Until this little child
molestationthing dies down a bit.

71
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,577
Gentlemen, teaching
is all i know.

72
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,277
It is the air
that i breathe.

73
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,433
We're sorry, mr. Garrison,
we have no choice.

74
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,246
Very well, i guess
i'm not a teacher anymore.

75
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:10,887
I suppose you'll be wanting
my badge and gun.

76
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:14,494
Mr. Garrison, most teachers
do not carry a gun!

77
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,795
Oh, so i can
keep it then?

78
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,302
Kyle, stan and his mother
came over to visit you.

79
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:23,568
Hello sweetie.

80
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,338
Dude, you can stop faking now,
we got a substitute teacher.

81
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,773
Kyle?

82
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,977
They say it's his kidneys,
kyle's always been a diabetic,

83
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,230
And lately his kidneys have
just been shutting down.

84
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,050
Well, the kids at school
made you a card, kyle, look!

85
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,954
Go on, butters.
I don't wanna.

86
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,055
Butters, go on!

87
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,556
Oh, all right then.

88
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,159
? We're so sorry you're not feeling
well we hope you're better soon?

89
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,460
? So we're bringing you
some sunshine?

90
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,594
? By singing you
this tune?

91
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,197
? Everybody misses you and
though we hate to cause a fuss?

92
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,135
? We'd like to say "get well
soon" and please don't die on us?

93
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,473
Dude, you really
are sick!

94
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,739
I don't know i...

95
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,292
I don't know what
to do, sharon.

96
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,811
They want him
to go into surgery.

97
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,511
That's so dangerous!

98
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,931
Sheila, have you tried
holistic natural medicines?

99
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,317
They work wonders, i read
all about it in "people".

100
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,584
Really, in "people"?

101
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,787
There's a brand-New shop
in town that sells

102
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,973
Holistic medicines
and all-Natural foods.

103
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,125
It's run by this
fascinatingwoman named

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,426
Miss information.

105
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,113
Oh, well, with a name like "miss
information", she must know something!

106
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,367
Why don't you at least take kyle down
there and see what she has to say!

107
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,102
Okay, i'll get
our coats.

108
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,572
Can i go now?

109
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,174
I don't know what
i'm going to do, mackey.

110
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,042
Teaching is
all i know.

111
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,176
Okay, well, maybe
you need to view this

112
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,247
As a chance to do something
you've always wanted to do.

113
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,416
I've always wanted
to write a novel.

114
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,682
Well, there you go, m'kay.

115
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,417
But i never know
what to write about.

116
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,621
Well, that's easy,
write about what you know.

117
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,157
Write about
what you love.

118
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:51,575
What do you love most?

119
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,959
Besides teaching?
Yes.

120
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:54,711
Poontang.

121
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,429
M'kay?

122
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,598
I can't help it, i'm a
womanizer sometimes, i know,

123
00:04:58,633 --> 00:04:59,864
But i just think that

124
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,068
Getting a woman home and
getting some "hot poon"

125
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,369
Is about the greatest thing
in the world.

126
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,503
Well, that settles it,
mr. Garrison.

127
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:09,008
What you need to do is go
write a great romance novel.

128
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,708
Yes, that's it!

129
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:15,081
I am going to write the
great american romance novel.

130
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,852
You'll see, the reason our
bodies fail is because of toxins.

131
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,119
Toxins?

132
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,420
All the horrible
food we eat,

133
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,973
The sodas and meats
arefilledwith toxins.

134
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:25,491
And the only way for
us to get better

135
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,094
Is to flush those toxins
out of our system.

136
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,347
Western medicine is so quick
to cut and carve up,

137
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:34,167
But all your son needs
is a toxin-Flushing diet

138
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:35,902
Of lemon juice
and cayenne pepper.

139
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,071
Wow, that's amazing,
miss information.

140
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,372
Do you hear that, kyle?

141
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,506
You don't need surgery
after all.

142
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,011
Excuse me, but what do
these toxins look like?

143
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:45,843
What?

144
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,613
Have you ever actually
seena toxin?

145
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,915
Don't be a smartass,
stanley.

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,385
Mrs. Broflofski, i would like to give
your son herbs to focus on the kidney.

147
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,987
I have these excellent herbs
from local native americans.

148
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,254
Oh, native americans!

149
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,891
Nowtheyknow how to
heal the body spiritually.

150
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,194
Out on the balcony,

151
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,964
When reginald kissed
diana's lips,

152
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,265
Her knees went weak.

153
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,399
Slowly he pulled
her top down,

154
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,036
Exposing her soft,
unyielding breast.

155
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,439
Oh, yeah,
now this is getting good.

156
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,508
Just the sight
of those breasts

157
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,543
Made reginald's penis
very hard.

158
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,111
His penis was of
considerable size

159
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,182
And now beads of sweat
ran slowly down his penis,

160
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,785
Making it glisten like
a strong swimmer,

161
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,320
Fresh from
out of the pool.

162
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,786
It was a fantastic penis

163
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,389
That seemed as strong
as a horse's leg,

164
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,026
Yet as delicate as a flower
wrapped in silk.

165
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,594
What a grand, grand penis!

166
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,099
Diana's nipples...
oh, let's see.

167
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:43,968
Diana's nipples...

168
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,738
Oh, writer's block,
writer's block!

169
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,872
Hmm, crap, i'm stuck!

170
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,943
Oh, well, maybe that's enough
writing for tonight, mr. Hat.

171
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,847
Oh, my,
he looks terrible.

172
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:55,715
Yes, poor little dear.

173
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,849
Good morning,
everyone.

174
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,052
Oh, thanks for coming,
miss information.

175
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,788
Kyle seems to be
getting worse.

176
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,223
Oooooo.

177
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,427
Oh, i don't agree,
he seems much better.

178
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:08,728
Really?
What?

179
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,330
Yes, his chi is flowing
much nicer than yesterday

180
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,866
And his aura
is lighter.

181
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,367
Oh, that's great news!

182
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,633
Oh, no!

183
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,403
Oh, no,
that's good!

184
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,572
Those are the toxins
flushing out of his system.

185
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:20,873
Ooh!

186
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,042
That's the bean with bacon soup
he ate half an hour ago.

187
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,211
Stanley, what did i say
about being a smartass?

188
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,477
Don't be a smartass.

189
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,681
Now, don't be fooled
as kyle's body sheds itself

190
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:30,000
More and more
of all the toxins.

191
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,744
He'll appear to be
getting worse,

192
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,418
But actually he's
getting better.

193
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,489
Wow! Well, i am sold
on natural medicines.

194
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,658
If only i had
known sooner.

195
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,827
I agree.
That's right.

196
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,297
Mr. Marsh is here
to see you.

197
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,032
All right,
send him in.

198
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,134
Oh, stanley.

199
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,166
Hi, doctor.

200
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,467
What can i do for you?

201
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,202
Well, it's
my friend, kyle.

202
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,705
I think he's really,
really sick.

203
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,273
He is really,
really sick, stanley.

204
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,442
I was seeing him last week
when he first got ill,

205
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,828
But unfortunately,
his mother has decided to

206
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:00,780
Put all her trust
into holistic medicine.

207
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,480
But i don't think
it's working.

208
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,250
All right, stanley, i'm going
to be very honest with you.

209
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,853
Your little friend kyle
needs a kidney transplant

210
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:10,323
Or it's very possible
that he will die.

211
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,023
Die?

212
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,877
But kyle's my best friend
in the whole world.

213
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,662
I know this is a lot
to lay on someone your age,

214
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,167
But the rest of the town is
so gung-Ho on new-Age medicine

215
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,867
That i have
nowhere else to turn.

216
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,938
I'll give kyle my kidney, even if
it hurts a whole lot, i don't care.

217
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,541
That's very brave, stan, but
i've already checked my records

218
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,360
And you and kyle
aren't a match for kidneys.

219
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:33,746
In fact, there's only
one person in south park

220
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,481
With the same
blood-Type as kyle.

221
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,782
Who?

222
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,819
Oh sh-.

223
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,723
Vrroo,
vrooo.

224
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,857
Bew-Bew,
bchhh!

225
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,494
Coming in for attack,
captain, bew-Bew-Bewbewbew!

226
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,760
Give me the
space cruiser, kenny.

227
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,929
Kenny, you have to give me
the sub-Space cruiser

228
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,001
So i can destroy the ganjeez
on cluster 5! No, no, it's mine!

229
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,169
Myahh, myahh!

230
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,640
Ha-Ha, i broke your
space cruiser, kenny.

231
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,207
Ow!

232
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,411
Oh, sweetums, did you
laugh too hard again?

233
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:07,111
Yeah.

234
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,881
Well, some more of your little
friends are here to play with you.

235
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,147
Okay, mom.

236
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,449
But, don't get
too close to kyle,

237
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,653
He looks like he
might have "the aids".

238
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:14,919
What's going on guys?

239
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,255
Cartman, we have to
ask you a question.

240
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,557
A very serious question.

241
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,858
Okay.

242
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,558
Kyle's in trouble,
cartman.

243
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,545
I can see him getting worse
right before my eyes.

244
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,497
There might be a way that
youcan save his life.

245
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,329
Uh-Huh.

246
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,099
What kyle really needs
is a new kidney.

247
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,834
Oh, i think i see
where this is going.

248
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,570
Uh.

249
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,738
His mom is using all this eastern
medicine, new-Age bullcrap on him,

250
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,005
But it's obviously
not working.

251
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,740
Stan, why don't you just
ask the question?

252
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,510
Okay, would you donate
one of your kidneys to kyle?

253
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,112
? No-No-No-No-No
no-No-No-No-No?

254
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:40,980
You only need one,
fat boy.

255
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,114
? No-No-No-No
no-No?

256
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,884
Dude, one of your friends is going to
die, don't you see how serious this is?

257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,089
Well, perhaps i can see my
way to giving up a kidney...

258
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,390
For a price.
Oh, my god!

259
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,692
How much?

260
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,427
I don't know, how much is
your life worth to you, kyle?

261
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,162
Cartman, you are so going
to hell when you die!

262
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,198
Yes, but until then i need
about $10,000,000.

263
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,898
Tmm-Mmm-Mmm-Mm-Mms!

264
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,633
What the hell would you do
with $10,000,000, fatass?

265
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,403
What i intend to do with the
money is not an issue, is it?

266
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,537
I suggest you start looking
for that money quickly,

267
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,307
Kyle doesn't seem to have much
time, tick-Tock, tick-Tock.

268
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,609
Come on, kyle,
let's get out of here.

269
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,742
Okay, where were we, kenny?
Oh, yeah...

270
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,380
Quick captain, we must destroy
the ganjeez on cluster 5!

271
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,132
Give me the space cruiser.

272
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,310
Give me it, kenny,
myahh!

273
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:20,049
Ooh, free-Range aspirin.

274
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,754
All-Natural
cell phones!

275
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,454
Oh, look, everyone!

276
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,658
These are our two
resident native americans.

277
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,260
Chief running pinto
and carlos ramirez.

278
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:33,032
Do you have any new
holistic items for sale?

279
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,298
Oh, oh yeah...

280
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,370
This is a...
dream catcher.

281
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,406
Oh, a dream catcher,
i'll buy one. Me too.

282
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,407
Yeah, these here are
cherokee-Hair tampons.

283
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,479
They're, like, tampons made with
all-Natural hair from the cherokee people.

284
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:49,532
Oh, a tampon made from cherokee
hair, nowthat sounds natural.

285
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,551
Native americans are more in
tune with the earth than we are.

286
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,286
Oh, yeah, we love
the earth, man.

287
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,987
Oh yeah,
the earth is great.

288
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,155
Mrs. Broflofski's son
is a little sick.

289
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,227
Perhaps she can bring him in tomorrow and
you can give him some spiritual healing.

290
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,528
Oh, sure,
we can do that, man.

291
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,131
We'll give him, like,
a brain enema or something.

292
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,733
Wonderful!

293
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,902
Why don't you follow me
over to the cash register

294
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,168
And i'll take
a deposit!

295
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,071
Do you have anymore
stuff to sell?

296
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,806
We want to buy
more stuff!

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,506
Yes, much, much
more stuff.

298
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,675
Sure, we just gotta go
back to our truck-

299
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,746
I mean ourhorsesand grab
some more junk, come on.

300
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,013
Goodbye, native americans!

301
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,999
The spirit of maya
is with you.

302
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,951
Oh, yeah, you too
and junk.

303
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh, hi stanley, look, i'm buying
you some more all-Natural toothpaste.

304
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:34,193
You mean the stuff that tastes
like ass and doesn't fight cavities?

305
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:35,061
That's right.

306
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,761
Look, umm, i know that
you all think that

307
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,964
The earth and its natural
healing powers can cure kyle,

308
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,700
But the doctor at the
hospital told me it can't.

309
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,435
Well, of course
the doctor told youthat,

310
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,170
Becausehewants
to makemoney.

311
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,772
Holistic medicine
is aboutnature.

312
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,809
$233.00.

313
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,411
Everything's going
to be fine, stan.

314
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,413
We're bringing kyle in tomorrow to
see the native americans personally.

315
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,050
Isn't it possible that these indians
don't know what they're talking about?

316
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,750
You watch
your mouth, stanley,

317
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,388
The native americans were raped
of their land and resources

318
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,654
By white people like us.

319
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,858
And that has something to do
with their medicine because-

320
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,894
Enough stanley!

321
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,364
Nobody wants
to listen, kenny. Mmmm?

322
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,100
I don't know
what else to do,

323
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,366
I mean he can die, kenny.

324
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,570
And that means we'd
never see him again. Uh-Huh.

325
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,739
I guess maybe i've always
taken friends for granted.

326
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,439
Like they'd
always be there.

327
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,174
If a friend died,
i don't know what i'd do.

328
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,028
Well, i'm not just going to stand
here and watch my friend die!

329
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:28,848
Kenny, go round up all the kids
in town who want to help kyle.

330
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,450
Round them up and meet me
at the bus stop at 7:30.

331
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,619
Kyle's gonna live!

332
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,922
Chapter 18.

333
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,958
Diana had never slept with
another woman before,

334
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,463
But it was an erotic thought
she often fantasized about.

335
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,300
Oh, yeah, mr.Hand!
Hot "lesbo" scene coming up.

336
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:50,102
And as rebecca's naked body
lay before her,

337
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,271
Diana couldn't help
but feel aroused.

338
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,006
"Go on"
rebecca said softly.

339
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,741
"Touch me."

340
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,441
Diana leaned down
slowly

341
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,513
And brushed rebecca's bare
stomach with her fingertips.

342
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:02,265
It felt good.

343
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,948
Like a penis.

344
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,585
A soft, but sturdy penis,
that felt warm to the touch.

345
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,320
In rebecca's mind,

346
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,357
She suddenly felt like
she was surrounded by penises,

347
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,057
They were
all around her.

348
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,093
Flopping all around
and slapping her face.

349
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,563
It was as if she were in
a redwood forest of penises.

350
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,068
They presented themselves, tall
and mighty all around her with-

351
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,671
Mr. Hat, what the hell
are you doing?

352
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,274
Oh, mr. Hat!

353
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,178
Come on,
where are they?

354
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,515
This is it?
Mm-Hmm.

355
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,782
Timmy!

356
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,118
This is everyone that
wanted to help kyle?

357
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,818
Well, clyde was
gonna come too,

358
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,588
But he said his mom was
making tacos for dinner

359
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,889
And clyde likes
tacos a whole lot.

360
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,156
Jesus christ.

361
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,492
Okay, butters, you take
this medical book

362
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:47,594
And everyone
follow me.

363
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,661
Where are we going?

364
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,263
We're going to go
take cartman's kidney.

365
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,468
Mom, do you ever have
those "heavy flow days"?

366
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,637
Oh, absolutely, sweetheart,
everybody does.

367
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,939
But remember the movie
"the shining",

368
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,674
Where the elevators doors are
opening up and all the -

369
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,710
Honey, what you need
is a more absorbent tampon.

370
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:05,976
Like what?

371
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,349
Well, what's the most
absorbent thing in the world?

372
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,784
Well, cherokee hair
i guess.

373
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,554
But what does that
have to do with me?

374
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,458
Because now there's new,
all-Natural cherokee hair tampons.

375
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,928
A cotton tampon can only
hold so much liquid,

376
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,097
Other tampons
also come up short.

377
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,363
But cherokee hair

378
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,834
Has been known for ages
to be strong and powerful.

379
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,471
Each tampon is hand woven from
over 200 strands of cherokee hair

380
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,507
And then bound together with
these decorative native beads.

381
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,809
You were right, mom!

382
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,411
All-Natural cherokee hair
tampons really did the trick.

383
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,947
And when you're
done using them,

384
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:42,448
They make agreattoy
for jessie.

385
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,050
Go, get it boy!

386
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,255
Let the wonders and
the mysteries of our people,

387
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,858
Like, change the way
you think about tampons.

388
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,365
No, no!

389
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,750
Hippies
all around me.

390
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:03,702
Help, mommy, hippies!

391
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,172
Okay, it's clear!

392
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,848
Okay, me and butters are going to go
up and take cartman's kidney out of him.

393
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,450
Kenny, you stay here and guard
his mom's door with timmy.

394
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,717
Timmy!
Sshh.

395
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,018
Timmy.

396
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,354
If she hears him screaming
or comes out or anything,

397
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,872
Just stall her,
all right?

398
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,922
Mm-Hmmtimmy!

399
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,692
Come on, butters,
let's go.

400
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,030
Uh-Oh,
cartman's pig.

401
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,367
Sshh, good pig,
good pig.

402
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,669
Shhh, it's okay.

403
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,841
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

404
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,541
Oh, no.

405
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,179
Oh, well,
we're busted.

406
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,649
Shut up, fluffy!

407
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,819
Oh, whew!

408
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:59,290
Hippies...
hippies, everywhere!

409
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:04,530
They want to save the earth, but all
they do is smoke pot and smell bad, help!

410
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,699
Okay, here we go.

411
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,771
Okay, let's see.

412
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,339
Looks like if we cut
here and here-

413
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,543
I hope it's not too bloody,
i'm wearing my favorite pants.

414
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:20,110
Well, here goes nothing.

415
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,314
Help me pull
his pajamas up.

416
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,351
No way,
"kidney blocker 2000"!

417
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,617
What, what, what?

418
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,254
Oh, stan and butters, trying
to take my kidney are you?

419
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,955
You suck, cartman.

420
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,158
Maybe so, but at least i was smart
enough to wear a "kidney blocker 2000".

421
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,893
Goddammit, don't you care
that kyle is going to die?

422
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,713
I do, i do care,
look how much.

423
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,099
Look, look how much
i care.

424
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,534
First and foremost,
mr. Garrison,

425
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,738
I would like to thank you for
choosing "harequin romance".

426
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
so did you read the book?

427
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,208
Yes, mr. Garrison,
we did read your book.

428
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,509
Well, what did you think?

429
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,643
Well, frankly,
mr. Garrison,

430
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,582
We don't know if the "harequin
romance" label is appropriate for you.

431
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,117
Oh, why not?

432
00:16:58,152 --> 00:16:59,583
Mr. Garrison,

433
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:03,305
Are you aware that the word "penis"
occurs 6,083 times in your novel?

434
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,335
Well, i'm sure there's lots of
naughty words, it is a romance novel.

435
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,330
No, i don't think that thisbook
really qualifies as a "romance" novel.

436
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,596
No?

437
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,101
No, this is what we in the book
publishing business like to call...

438
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,403
Gay.

439
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,536
Really, really gay.

440
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,873
What the hell are you
talking about?

441
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,308
It's just that the focus
seems to be on themaleorgan.

442
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,512
Well, i thought it was mostly
women that read these things.

443
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,778
It is.

444
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,947
Well, women want to read
about "ding-Dongs".

445
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,584
You think women care about
the details of female anatomy?

446
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,851
Hell no!

447
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,055
Women want to read about
big, powerful schlongs!

448
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,188
Look, i've seen women
read these things.

449
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,826
They skim along, skim along until
they get to the part about the penis,

450
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,995
That's what they want, so
that's what i'm giving them!

451
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,129
Hmm.

452
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,332
There's nothing more
i can do, kenny.

453
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,466
I've tried everything
to save kyle.

454
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,670
Holistic medicine is
gonna kill my friend.

455
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,706
My friend is gonna die.

456
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,309
He's gonna die and there's
nothing i can do about it.

457
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,443
Oh, god!

458
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:03,382
That does it!
Hmm hmm hmm hmm!

459
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,984
I'm going home.

460
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,286
Look out!

461
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,853
Oops.

462
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,925
Oh, i'll never see
kyle again.

463
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,227
Four dozen cherokee hair
tampons, please.

464
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,431
No problem, man,
pay miss information up front.

465
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,769
Hi, i have a little pain in
my balls whenever i watch vh-1.

466
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,070
Here try this, man.

467
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,974
Uh, this is, uh,
"all-Natural ball juice".

468
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,542
Well, i feel
better already.

469
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,613
And next we have
mrs. Broflofski's son.

470
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,614
Okay, here he is.

471
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,085
Uh, hey man, that kid
looks really sick.

472
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,156
Yeah, he realy needs
his toxins flushed again.

473
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,325
No, i mean, he looks
really sick, man.

474
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,494
You should take him to,
like, a doctor.

475
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,495
But you're more in touch
with the earth.

476
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,000
But being in touch with the earth
has nothing to do with dying, man.

477
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:58,036
It's okay, we trust that
you know what you're doing.

478
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,905
No, man, that kid
needs a doctor.

479
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,109
Besides we're not actually
native americans, i mean...

480
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,278
I'm more like
a mexican.

481
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,146
What?
What?

482
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,846
Yeah, mexican.

483
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,049
Oh, phtoo!
Oh my god! Ohhh!

484
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,749
Ahhhhhhhh!

485
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,352
How dare you
deceive us like that!

486
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,556
Hey, we never said we were
native americans, man.

487
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,256
Miss information
said that.

488
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,460
Yeah, she said nobody would
buy anything from mexicans.

489
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,364
Uh, toxinsare
your enemy.

490
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,966
Kill her!

491
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,570
That's funny.

492
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,907
So, now can we take kyle
to the hospital?

493
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,075
Yes, of course, but we
don't have a kidney donor.

494
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,377
That's all right,
if you all help,

495
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,546
I think i have a plan.

496
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,583
Ah! Oh!

497
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,956
Ah! That son of a bitch!

498
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,727
Okay, asshole,
give me back my kidney.

499
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,263
Dude, please,
kyle needs it.

500
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,729
It's mine,
not yours, mine!

501
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,366
Give it back right now or
there's going to be hell to pay!

502
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,969
All right, here.

503
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,669
Thank you.

504
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,608
And you better hope to god that it
still works just like it did before.

505
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,211
Doctor, eric cartman
is here.

506
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:13,477
Why hello there, eric.

507
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,982
You see that,
that's mine.

508
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,151
My asshole friend stan took my
kidney and i need it put back in.

509
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,320
Please.

510
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,020
Oh, i see.

511
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,189
Are you sure that now
that it's already out,

512
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,392
You don't want to just let
your friend kyle have it?

513
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,127
No, because it doesn't
belong to kyle,

514
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,261
It belongs to me,
it's mine!

515
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,899
Well, all right then, we'll
get you prepped for surgery.

516
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,634
If you'll just
sign this release.

517
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,935
Thank you.

518
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:40,839
How are you
feeling, bubbie?

519
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:41,707
Better, thanks.

520
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,407
You look
a lot better.

521
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,177
Yeah, it looks like western
medicine really did the trick.

522
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,779
Hey, thanks for going through
all that to save my life, stan.

523
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,046
Dude, you're
my best friend.

524
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,215
I don't want you to die
until i do.

525
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,418
Yeah, hey man, we're glad
you're getting better too.

526
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,118
Hey, hey,
what's going on?

527
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,322
Kyle's all better, cartman,
thanks to you.

528
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:57,756
Huh?

529
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,022
It was all a trick.

530
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,757
Your mom undid
the kidney blocker

531
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,527
And then we put ketchup in your bed,
so you'd think we took your kidney.

532
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,564
Yes, but it was all just a trick to get
you to come in and sign this release.

533
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,533
Isn't that funny, sweetie?

534
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,385
Ooh, i am
so pissed off!

535
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,168
Oh, here's everybody.

536
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,721
Hi, mr. Garrison,
where have you been?

537
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,799
Boys, i have
an announcement to make.

538
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,842
I'm not going to be
your teacher anymore.

539
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:18,542
I've become
a best-Selling author.

540
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,047
And kyle i want you to have a
signed copy as a "get well" present.

541
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,181
Oh... thanks.

542
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,252
I'm sure going
to kill you guys!

543
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,987
Careful, cartman, you might
pop your stitches.

544
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:29,855
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

545
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,590
Huh, what the-

546
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,759

the crappy kidney.
