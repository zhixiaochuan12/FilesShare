00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,271
That's it,
isn't it?

00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,308
You want me to start a boy band, so i

That's it!

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,610
Gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

43
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,814
This is the beginning
of a great time in our lives.

44
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:56,948
God has finally
spoken to me, guys

45
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,653
And he has told me how
i can make $10,000,000.

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,153
How?
Boy band.

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,455
Boy band?
Boy band.

48
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm not being
in a faggy boy band.

00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,393
There's nothingfaggyabout
$10,000,000, asshole!

50
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,695
This was a message
from god!

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,996
Dude, we don't have
any musical talent.

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,130
That didn't stop any of
the other boy bands, dumbass!

53
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,299
I've got prerecorded music we
can sing to, just like they do.

54
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,804
All we need to do is practice our
choreography over and over and over.

55
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,504
Mmrm-Mrm-Mrrm-Mrrm-Mrm.

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,142
Shut up, kenny, and then i know i can

57
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:23,443
So everybody get in
a straight line,

58
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,178
We're going to listen to
the song from the top and-

59
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,347
Wait a minute, there's
only four of us. So?

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,481
So all boy bands
what? Have five members.

61
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,684
N'sync, backstreet boys,
new kids on the block,

62
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,986
All had five members.
He's right.

63
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,721
Damn it!
Okay, okay, okay.

64
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,323
We'll put off practice for now and
hold auditions for a fifth member.

65
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,492
Get the word out that auditions
will be tomorrow morning.

66
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,830
Did you have fun at eric's
house today, stanley?

67
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:45,565
I guess.
What did you do?

68
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,699
Well, cartman wants
to start a boy band,

69
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,469
So we're going to rehearse and then
try to perform at the south park mall.

70
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,204
Oh, that sounds nice.

71
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,904
No, it doesnot
soundnice.

72
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,674
Stanley, you are going to have
nopart of that boy band.

73
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,374
But dad, all my friends
are doing it.

74
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,578
If all your friends jumped off
a cliff, would you do that too?

75
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,712
Cartman says we can
make $10,000,000.

76
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,349
You are not going to be in a boy
band, stanley, and that is final!

77
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
Geez, what's up

94
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,256
Guys, if we're going to impress

00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,122
'Cause i'm like, you know,
the tough one.

150
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,326
Every boy band has to have the one
member that's, you know, is tough.

151
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,495
I want to be

You can't be the tough one

00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,604
Jews are tough!
Since when?

Since abraham,
fatass!

157
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,039
All right, fine, here.

158
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,243
Jesus christ, i wonder if every
boy band had to go through this.

159
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,882
Hey cartman, what does
"fingerbang" mean anyways?

160
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,016
I heard it on hbo,
it means like, you know,

161
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,786
When you pretend to use your
finger like a gun or something.

162
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,486
Mrlp-Mrhh-Mrr-Mrlp!

163
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,787
Kenny says that's
not what it means.

164
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,557
Okay, kenny, what does
fingerbang mean then?

165
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,196
What! Who the hell
would do that!

166
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,365
Jesus christ, grow up,
kenny, would you?

167
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,100
All right, boys,
let's do it from the top.

168
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,835
One, two, three, four...

169
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,474
Now i know that this is your first day
on the job of mall security, rookie.

170
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,528
Keeping the law in the mall
is just like any tough city

171
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:54,547
And especially because
they don't let us have guns,

172
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,681
It can be very dangerous.

173
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,451
All right, guys, just do it
like we rehearsed.

174
00:06:58,486 --> 00:06:59,717
We need energy,
we need to be up!

175
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,921
Excuse me, just where
do you think you're going?

176
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,890
We're going to see
the mall manager.

177
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,825
Do you have
the proper clearance?

178
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,091
Uh-Oh, mall cops.

179
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,861
You have to make
an appointment first.

180
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,561
Now move along, sir.

181
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,863
But we practiced for days!

182
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,031
All we want to do is
show the guy what we can do,

183
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,235
So that maybe we'll have a chance
to perform in the plaza of the-

184
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,369
Ah, ah, oh!

185
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,139
Ah, ah, oh,
goddamn it!

186
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,874
Jesus christ, dude!

187
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,176
Oh, god,
i can't see!

188
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,212
Move along, sir,
or i'll do it again.

189
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,647
You see, you put your life
on the line every day.

190
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,851
Well, i guess we can't get in
to see the mall manager.

191
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,551
The hell we can't!

192
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,622
I'm not letting no washed-Up
mall cops ruin my divine quest.

193
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,490
Come on!

194
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,263
Hey!

195
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,683
What are you doing?

196
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,069
Nothing, just shopping.

197
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,637
Move along, sir.

198
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,274
You see, sometimes
you gotta just do that,

199
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,877
Keep shoppers
on their toes, try it.

200
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,577
Hey!

201
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,781
What are you doin'?

202
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,481
Nothing, why?

203
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,650
Move along, ma'am.

204
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,854
That's what being
a mall cop is all about.

205
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,987
Yeah, cool.

206
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,324
Attention mall shoppers,

207
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,926
The next 20 people to buy
an orange smoothie

208
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,095
Will also receive
a complimentary nissan sentra.

209
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,963
Hurry up.

210
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:17,830
Ah!

211
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,999
Jesus, they're gonna
start a riot!

212
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,602
All right, guys,
here we go.

213
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,553
Hello, sir!
What?

214
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,197
Hey, who are you?

215
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,807
We arefingerbang.

216
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,073
Oh, what?

217
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,242
How'd you get in here?
Hey!

218
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,977
We would like
to audition for you

219
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,181
For a gig in the central plaza
of your fine mall.

220
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,783
What? Oh, you want
to play at the mall?

221
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,651
Like tiffany?

222
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,254
Sort of like tiffany, yes,
can we audition?

223
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,989
Oh, well, i guess.

224
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,255
What?

225
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,025
All right,
let's do it, boys!

226
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,195
? I'm gonna fingerbang bang
you into my life?

227
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,134
? Girl, you like to fingerbang
and that's all right?

228
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,604
? Going to fingerbang bang
you every night?

229
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,074
? And girl you know, you girl,
you girl, you're the girl-?

230
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,243
? Girl, you're the girl
of my dreams?

231
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,978
Okay, that's enough!

232
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,914
? You're my fantasy, my fantasy
-? Thank you!

233
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,015
So, can we play here?

234
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:09,882
What?

235
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,400
No.
No?

236
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,393
Who? No.

237
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,352
Why not?

238
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,052
Well, uh, oh...

239
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,655
Right now there's a cheese
and sausage cart in the plaza,

240
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,028
And i would
- I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while.

241
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,294
What?

242
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,630
You don't think
we're any good, do you?

243
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,897
No, i mean,

244
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,100
Just not quite as good
as sausage and cheese.

245
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,469
Well, come on guys,
we gave it our best.

246
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,872
Wow, that was your best!

247
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,908
Wow, i feel so rejected.

248
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,042
Yeah.
There you are!

249
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,812
You're the hoodlums
who got on the intercom

250
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,547
And started an orange
smoothie riot! Uh-Oh.

251
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,282
I will now read you
your mall rights.

252
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,319
You have the right to shop
at a variety of malls-

253
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:47,186
Run for it!

254
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,921
Go get 'em, rookie!

255
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,224
Where is stan?

256
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
Oh, he's over at eric's house
practicing for his boy band.

257
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,562
What, i specifically
told him not to do that!

258
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,199
Now, randy, calm down, it's
just a silly little dream.

259
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,951
They're not gonna
actually make it.

260
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,634
And what if they
do make it, sharon?

261
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,272
What if they do make it? Are you
going to be the one to tell him?

262
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,007
Mom, what's up
dad's ass?

263
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,959
It's a long story, shelly.

264
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,603
Let's just say your father...

265
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:13,212
Has a lot up his ass
right now.

266
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,213
Oh, oh, hello, eric.

267
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,816
Problem, chef,
i have many problems.

268
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,321
Well, if you, uh, come back
in just a little bit, eric,

269
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,588
I'll see if i can
help you out.

270
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,924
I just don't know
what i'm going to do,

271
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,093
Sometimes i just wonder if god
is just toying with me.

272
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,793
All right, eric,
what's the matter?

273
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,430
Chef, god told me i was to start
a boy band and make $10,000,000.

274
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,165
The problem is,
it isn't working.

275
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,768
I mean i feel the music
burning inside me,

276
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,902
But i just can't
express it right, you know.

277
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,973
Well, eric, i think you're just
focusing in on the wrong thing.

278
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,673
Boy bands
aren't about music.

279
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,745
Boy bands are created
by corporations to make money,

280
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,480
They're all based
on "the garmlich effect".

281
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,214
What's
"the garmlich effect"?

282
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,516
The law of physics
that states

283
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,468
If one girl screams
for something,

284
00:10:52,503 --> 00:10:54,329
It will make
other girls scream

285
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,120
And then it grows
exponentiously

286
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,191
Until all girls within a
five-Mile radius are screaming.

287
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,727
So how do
boy bands use that?

288
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,193
All they do
is make videos

289
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,397
Showing tons and tons of girls
screaming for the boy bands.

290
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,433
Once you get girls screaming,
you can't stop 'em.

291
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,699
They're crazy.

292
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,469
Except for lillith,
of course.

293
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,771
Thanks.
You're welcome.

294
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,904
Now go away.
Okay!

295
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,542
And a cucumber in the pants
never hurt either.

296
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,843
Cucumber in the pants,
got it!

297
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,747
All right everybody, listen up, this
is how this first shot is gonna work.

298
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,916
The girls are standing here and
then the members of the band walk by

299
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,616
Lookingcool.

300
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,952
When you see us,
you girls all scream like,

301
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,121
"Oh, my god it's fingerbang,
oh, my god!", okay?

302
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,856
Are we going to get paid
now or after?

303
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,808
I'll pay you afterwards,
promise.

304
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,235
Okay, timmy,
roll camera! Timmy!

305
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,593
Dude, what's wrong
with your leg?

306
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,797
Huh, oh chef said to put a cucumber
down my pants for good luck.

307
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,267
Ah!
Yay! Woo-Hoo!

308
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,967
Wait, wait, cut!
Ha-Ha-Ha!

309
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,702
You have to go crazier
than that.

310
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,472
I mean, you have to act like
it's freakin' leonardo decaprio.

311
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,075
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if
leonardo decaprio came walking passed us.

312
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,142
Yeah!
Yeah!

313
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,111
Fine, who would
you go crazy for?

314
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,245
Matt lauer.
Matt lauer.

315
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,882
Okay, fine, pretend
that we're matt lauer.

316
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,617
Oh, okay!
Okay, roll camera.

317
00:11:58,652 --> 00:11:59,884
Timmy!

318
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,722
Ah!

319
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,256
Jesus christ!

320
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,727
? Fingerbang bang you
every night?

321
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,993
And cut!

322
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,329
All right,
our video is complete.

323
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,498
With the grace of god, i can
now go back to that mall manager

324
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,233
And show him
what we've got!

325
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,534
Okay, so,
where's our money?

326
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,234
Ah, kyle has it.

327
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,571
Stanley, what the hell
are you doing?

328
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:19,872
We're making
a music video.

329
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,041
You get in the truck
right now!

330
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:22,475
Dad, i was just -

331
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,608
Get in the truck!

332
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,812
Dad, i did all my chores, why
can't i play with my friends?

333
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,512
Stanley, it's just that
there's better things

334
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,716
You can be doing on a saturday
than singing and dancing.

335
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,284
You could be watching tv
or laying in bed.

336
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,487
Dad, i like being in a boy
band, i think it's interesting.

337
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,656
Well, there's plenty of other
interesting things you can do.

338
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,825
Have you ever tried marijuana? No!

339
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,994
Well, maybe it's time.
Dad!

340
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,429
Hey!

341
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,164
What are you doing?

342
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,899
I've got a new strain
of anthrax

343
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,537
That i will see unleash upon
all of north america.

344
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,671
Move along, sir.
Huh?

345
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,840
Attention, shoppers,

346
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,610
There are naked people
at the orange smoothie machine,

347
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,345
There are naked people
at the orange-

348
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,646
Oh!
God damn it.

349
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,947
Hello again.

350
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:02,780
What?

351
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,550
Oh, it's you,
i don't like you.

352
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:06,285
I know you didn't
loveour audition,

353
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,586
But now we have
a video.

354
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,853
Oh, what?

355
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,189
If you would, sir,
just watch this

356
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,358
And prepare
to be wowed.

357
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,430
Timmy!

358
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,202
Goddamn it,
our camera guy kinda sucks,

359
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,371
But this next shot we did
was really cool.

360
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,673
Ah!

361
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,877
Timmy,
livin' a lie!

362
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,144
Son of a bitch!

363
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,914
Hey, this video's dumb.

364
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,180
You don't understand,

365
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,733
Girls were going
crazy for us, please,

366
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:39,251
This is what god
wants me to do, please!

367
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,819
All right, all right,
what?

368
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,890
Well, i guess i can move the sausage
and cheese cart off to one side

369
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,209
For a little while.

370
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:47,493
Really, you will?

371
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,228
Only for
20 minutes though.

372
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,095
That's all we need.

373
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,831
How about this afternoon
at three o'clock?

374
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,531
Oh, okay.

375
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,602
Yes, thank you, sir,
you will not be disappointed.

376
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,205
Oh, mrs. Cartman,
i've been very bad, okay.

377
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,905
You have been bad,
mr. Mackey,

378
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,108
So you're going to have
to drink from this glass.

379
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,844
Oh, yeah,
that makes me hot.

380
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,579
Oh, mom!
Wow!

381
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:07,880
What?

382
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,953
It's not fair, dad, why can't
i be in a boy band?

383
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,653
Because i said so!

384
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,857
Dad, cartman said we're going to
perform in the mall at three o'clock,

385
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:20,858
My friends are going to be
pissed off at me. Pissed off then.

386
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,628
I don't understand, just let me let
me go do this one thing and i won't-

387
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:23,947
No!

388
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,231
No!

389
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,773
Dad, what the hell
is going on?

390
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,473
I was...

391
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,545
I was 18 when my high school men's
choir performed at the grand opening

392
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,714
Of a sporting goods store
in denver.

393
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,184
? Everything will wait?

394
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,220
? We are the little rains...?

395
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,354
I was just one
of 15 members

396
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,992
And i had no idea that a record
producer was in the audience.

397
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:56,028
?... The colorado trail?

398
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,498
Kid, can i talk to you?
Sure.

399
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,198
You were really great
up there.

400
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,402
Too good for a pissant choir
in a pissant mountain town.

401
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,668
Oh, thanks.

402
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,438
Listen, i'm putting together
a rock group,

403
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,173
Avocalgroup called
"the ghetto avenue boys".

404
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,342
I think you would make
a perfect member.

405
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,528
What, me, you like
my singing that much?

406
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,272
Yeah, i think
your mustache is perfect.

407
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:15,981
How would you like
to come to new york

408
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,716
And start
a singing career?

409
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:18,983
Oh my god!
I don't know.

410
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,753
I mean, i still have
another year of high school.

411
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,922
Hey, look, if you don't
want it, i'll keep looking.

412
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,622
No, wait, i mean...
i'll think about it.

413
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,825
I take it that means yes,
call me in the morning.

414
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,994
And just like that,
i left everything.

415
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,296
I dropped out
of high school.

416
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,562
See ya!

417
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,898
I said good-Bye
to my girlfriend.

418
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:33,766
See ya!

419
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,067
And i left my family.

420
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:35,935
See ya!

421
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,068
And suddenly there i was,

422
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,272
Thrown into a group
with four other young men

423
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,573
Who i didn't even know.

424
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,875
Take 112.

425
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,779
? You've got it,
you know you've got it, girl?

426
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,314
? What you've got is it?

427
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,780
The songs were terrible,

428
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,550
But believe it or not
the country ate them up.

429
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,816
The next thing i knew,

430
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,586
We were the biggest thing
in the world.

431
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,287
? What you've got is it?

432
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,273
? Now, give it
to me 'cause...?

433
00:15:58,308 --> 00:16:00,134
I had everything,
a huge house

434
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,926
And all the women
you can imagine.

435
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,563
And then one day,
just as quick as it started...

436
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,298
All right guys,
let's take it from the top.

437
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,599
Hey, mr. Allens.

438
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,918
Hey, oh...

439
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,228
Uh, randy.

440
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,503
Who are they?

441
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,672
These are
"the avenue ghetto street boys".

442
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,372
My new boy band.

443
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,142
But, we're still
selling records, right?

444
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,842
Look, kid,

445
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,480
You're just getting a
littleoldto be in a boy band.

446
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,348
I'm 19.

447
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,649
Get a life, marsh!

448
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,818
All right, guys,
let's take it from the top.

449
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,553
They said that after
all the money we had made

450
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,854
We were in debt
to the studio.

451
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,988
So they towed my car.
See ya!

452
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,758
The women all left.
See ya! See ya!

453
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,927
And they took back my house. See ya!

454
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,096
The only thing i could do
was come back to colorado

455
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,663
And face everyone that
i had abandoned.

456
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,301
Hey, weren't you the guy
in thatstupidboy band,

457
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,836
"The ghetto avenue boys"?

458
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:45,471
Sure, i remember you.

459
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,072
? You got it baby?

460
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,807
? You got it going on?

461
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,110
And so, you see,
stanley,

462
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,530
Idoknow what
i'm talking about.

463
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,881
Jesus christ,
i never knew.

464
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,303
I didn't want you to know,
because now i'm a joke.

465
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,690
Ever since then, i have
wishedevery single day

466
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,026
That i can go back to that
moment when i was offered the job

467
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,726
And sayno!

468
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,496
Because all the fame,
the money, the women,

469
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,196
All it did
was build me up,

470
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,833
So that i could be knocked down
harder than anybody in the world.

471
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,268
That's what being in a boy band
is all about, stan.

472
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,472
It's people smothering you
and embracing you and loving you

473
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,641
And then spitting you out
and throwing you away

474
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,393
Like you were
last night's pork chops.

475
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,354
Now, we wander the earth
in disarray,

476
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,280
Us, new kids on the block,
the osmonds,

477
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,980
We're all the same.

478
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,919
Andthatis why
you can't go to the mall.

479
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,823
Okay.

480
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,896
Wow, there must be at least
20 people out there.

481
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:44,763
Where the hell is stan?

482
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,231
He'll be here,
stan wouldn't douche.

483
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,800
I swear to god, if he ruins
this dream of mine,

484
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,066
I will have his nuts!

485
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,235
Hey, are you gonna
do that thing or what?

486
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,306
Yes, yes, sir, any second, we're
just waiting on one more member.

487
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,210
Well, hurry up, i can't keep the sausage
and cheese cart off this spot much longer.

488
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,962
Yeah, we'll start
right away.

489
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,645
We'll have to do it
without him.

490
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,849
Hell no, i'm not being part
of afourmember boy band!

491
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,150
We'll look stupid.
Yeah!

492
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,452
Oh, goddamn it!

493
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,658
Dad?

494
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,561
Huh, yeah?

495
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,261
I just wanted
to tell you

496
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,814
That i don't think
you're a joke.

497
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,332
I mean, whatever
you used to be,

498
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,032
You're just my dad

499
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,236
And you're the best dad
i've ever had.

500
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,839
Come here, stanley.

501
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,224
Stan, it was wrong of me
to try and stop you

502
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,176
From joining a boy band
without explaining why.

503
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,911
I made some mistakes
in my life

504
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,346
And now i have to let you
make your own mistakes. Yeah.

505
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,852
You know, in a way, i think i was
evenjealous of you being in a boy band.

506
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,552
Isn't that stupid?
Not really.

507
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,322
Not any more stupid than some
of the other stuff you've done.

508
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,491
Well, come on, i'll drive
you down to the mall.

509
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,624
Really?
What you guys can do.

510
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,696
And then we'll go buy you a small
toy, so you can forget all about this.

511
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,997
All right!

512
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,432
What's happening here?

513
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,167
I don't know,
i guess nothing.

514
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,720
Hmm, well then,
let's walk away then.

515
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,239
Goddamn it,
people are walking away!

516
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,939
All right, kids,
that does it.

517
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,010
You're gonna have to move and make
way for the sausage and cheese cart.

518
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,311
Just another minute.

519
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,046
Sorry, get out.

520
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,517
Well, god, i guess you
got me again, didn't you?

521
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,650
Yeah, that was
a good one, god.

522
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,420
Hope it made you laugh,
you sick bastard.

523
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,956
What's that?

524
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,422
It's stan!

525
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,309
Oh, thank you, god,
oh, praise his name!

526
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:22,126
Dude, where the hell
have you been?

527
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,662
Sir, we're all here now,
can we go on, please?

528
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:24,928
Who?

529
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,132
Well, okay, i guess,
but hurry up.

530
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:27,965
We will.

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

532
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,337
You are about to witness the next
great boy band of the country.

533
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,471
Some day you will all
be among those who can say

534
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,543
"I saw fingerbang when they first
performed at some crappy little mall."

535
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,729

further ado

00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:41,880

No, he can't be dead.

540
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:49,488
Dude, he's pretty dead.

541
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,989
No, we were so close!

542
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,158
All right, that's it,
kids, get out!

543
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,858
But, we have to perform.

544
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,628
We don't have
a fifth member,cartman.

545
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,930

00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,306
Can i get
your autograph?

562
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,573
Okay, okay.

563
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,343
Hey, don't hassle
the talent, ma'am.

564
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,511
I actually don't really
know who they are,

565
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,813
I was just getting
an autograph -

566
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,079
Ah!

567
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,248
Move along, ma'am.

568
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,549
Thatwaspretty good, kids.

569
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,621
Maybe you can come perform
at my elk's club sometime.

570
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:56,887
Okay, yeah, maybe.

571
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,524
God, now it's like everybody
wants a piece of us.

572
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,791
Yeah.

573
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,778
I don't know if i can
handle all this fame.

574
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,730
I mean, i always thought
i'd want to be famous,

575
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,898
But now that i am
i don't know if i like it.

576
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,935
I mean i probably can't even walk through
this mall right now without people going

577
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,104
"Oh, my god, it's
thefingerbangguy, oh, my god."

578
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:13,839
Yeah, that's
gonna suck.

579
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
Yeah, i just want to be
a normal kid again,

580
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,627
Have a normal life and
appreciate what i have.

581
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,779
I think you boys are
very smart for your age.

582
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,948
Come on, i'll buy you all
an orange smoothie.

583
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,683
I don't think
they sell those anymore.

584
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,719
Hey, cartman, do you think god is going to
be mad at you for not making $10,000,000?

585
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,322
Oh, screw god, i'm not
scared of him, he's a pussy.

586
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,226
You know i'm just kidding,
