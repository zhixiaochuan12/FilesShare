00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,711
? I'm going down
to south park?

3
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,013
? Gonna have
myself a time?

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,146
? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,483
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,784
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,953
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:19,988 --> 00:00:21,653
? Ample parking
day or night?

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,423
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,958
? Headed on up
to south park?

11
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,459
? Gonna see if
i can't unwind?

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,881
? So come on down
to south park?

13
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,833
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,241
Well, here we are, dude, the
first day of fourth grade.

15
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,844
Yeah, no more getting pushed
around by fourth graders.

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,596
Get out my way,
you little dorks!

17
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,340
Hey, we're fourth
graders now too.

18
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah, but now
we're fifth graders,

19
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:51,785
You stupid fourth grader,
so move it!

20
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,485
Oh, gay, dude!

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,821
Dude, we gotta find some
third graders to beat up.

22
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,087
Hey, come here.
What?

23
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,857
What grade are you
going into? Third.

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,159
Stupid third grader!

25
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,676
Yeah,
get out of here!

26
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,761
Ow.
That's better.

27
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,364
Y'know, i heard our fourth-Grade
teacher is some new lady from denver.

28
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,196
Denver?

29
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,931
Dude, we could
walk all over her.

30
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,666
He's right, we have to take
a hard stance right now

31
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,870
And establish that we're the
dominant ones in this relationship.

32
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,570
All right, hey,
listen up everybody.

33
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,208
We need to stand up to this new
teacher and insert ourselves.

34
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:17,976
Let's all do something
radical. Like what?

35
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,947
Like, how about right at 8:35
we all jump on our desk,

36
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:23,883
Pull down our pants and shout
"kiss my ass" all together.

37
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,185
Yeah!
That's perfect.

38
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,353
But when we pull our pants down
should we stand frontways or back?

39
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,222
I mean, do we show our behinds
or our wieners?

40
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,294
I think showing our asses will
be quite sufficient, butters.

41
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,994
Maybe we could
stand like this,

42
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,198
With our wieners poking through
the back of our legs, y'know,

43
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,765
Give her a nice
fruit bowl.

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,934
Yeah, or we could
just show our asses.

45
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,103
Okay, so it's decided,
when the clock hits 8:35

46
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,740
We all stand on our desks, pull down
our pants and yell "kiss my ass".

47
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,059
Together
we are strong.

48
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:50,308
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

49
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,512
Hey, timmy might need some help
pulling his pants down.

50
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:53,813
We got you
covered, timmy.

51
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,115
Timmy!

52
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,717
Whoa, dude, this is
our new classroom!

53
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:58,983
Look at
all this stuff.

54
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,753
Hey, what the hell's with
these little half desks?

55
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,055
Dude, look at the walls.

56
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,224
Everything is written in some
strange foreign language.

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,976
All right, children,
quiet down.

58
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,694
Welcome to
the fourth grade.

59
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,960
Holy god, dude.

60
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,597
Her titties are
f- Kin' huge!

61
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,217
My name is
ms. Choks-On-Dik.

62
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,803
More like,
"ms. Makes-Me-Sick".

63
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,574
Playtime is over, children,
do you understand me?

64
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,309
I don't know how
your last teacher behaved,

65
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,945
But this is
the fourth grade!

66
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,398
And it is time
to go to work!

67
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,816
Heh heh heh-
Kiss my ass!

68
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,986
Oh, weak, you guys,
seriously weak.

69
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,624
Well, young man, i hope you have
a good explanation for this.

70
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,757
Oh, i'm sure i do.

71
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,528
This is the fourth grade,
you need to grow up!

72
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,228
I'm trying.

73
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,998
Now get back to your desk
and write a thousand-Word essay

74
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,034
On why you feel you need to
disrupt my class.

75
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,300
Fantastic, guys.

76
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,938
Now, let us begin
our first day exam.

77
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,257
Uh! Uh!

78
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:54,506
Silence!

79
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,842
What a bitch!

80
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,577
And did you see
her lazy eye?

81
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,312
You can't even tell
who she's looking at.

82
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,047
You guys are
all such pussies!

83
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,313
I can't take it, man!

84
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,385
Writing in cursive, fractions-
I can't do it!

85
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,085
This is it,
the end of innocence.

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,722
This is the loss of that playful
youth all our parents warned us about.

87
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,891
I just didn't think
it would come so soon.

88
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,158
Yeah, only now
do we realize

89
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,795
How much we all took the
third grade for granted. Huh?

90
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,495
Everything was great
in third grade,

91
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,000
And now that it's all over we're
starting to see just how special it was.

92
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:25,737
? Rein the third grade?O be

93
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,808
? We used to laugh and play
and cherish each day?

94
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:30,109
? In the third grade?

95
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,146
? We learned wondrous things
from our teacher so nice?

96
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,182
? Sat on marshmallow desks
with teddy-Bear smiles?

97
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,001
? The world seemed to
all make sense?

98
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:41,387
? But that sense seems
to slowly fade?

99
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,955
? After third grade?

100
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,558
? In third grade we used to
write with crayons?

101
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,629
? We would make sparkly pictures
with glitter and glue?

102
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,466
? We had warm cookies
and hearts full of love?

103
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,268
? And there wasn't a care
in the world for me?

104
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,402
? Or for you?

105
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,172
? There's not a thing
in this life?

106
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,872
? That i wouldn't trade?

107
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,509
? Just to go back
for one minute?

108
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,980
? To third grade?

109
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,920
Wow, i had already forgotten
how great third grade was.

110
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:15,620
Oh, sure was.

111
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,921
Wish i was
still there.

112
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,559
Hey, that's it- We gotta
go back to third grade.

113
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,825
How?

114
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,812
We travel
back in time.

115
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,729
Oh, yeah,
time travel!

116
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,499
How we gonna do that?
Does it hurt?

117
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,251
I don't wanna do it
if it hurts.

118
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:29,969
Or if it makes you
get all sticky.

119
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,103
It can't be that bad,
people do it on tv all the time.

120
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,307
Yeah, we just have to find
somebody who knows how to do it.

121
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,007
What about those two college
guys next door to me?

122
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,742
They're always doing science
experiments in their basement.

123
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,380
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back
in time, those two dorks will know how.

124
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,080
When it comes to
time travel theory

125
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,249
There are basically
two schools of thought.

126
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,886
The "spock theory" is that
a slingshot around the sun

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,489
Could create a wormhole
in which time could not escape.

128
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,056
The "lt. Commander
data theory", however,

129
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,995
Is that a magnetic vibration could
create a rip in the time-Space continuum-

130
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,798
Look, whatever it takes, we just
have to get back to third grade.

131
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,298
Time travel
is no laughing matter.

132
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,502
Four times the "enterprise"
traveled back in time

133
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,671
And four times they almost
didn't make it back.

134
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,406
We don't want to make it back,
we want to stay there.

135
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,574
Ohh.
So, can you do it?

136
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,743
It's all theoretical, but from
a scientific standpoint

137
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,346
The creation of a rip
in space-Timeispossible.

138
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,480
We just need to find
an inertia device.

139
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,985
Hey, this kid's electric wheelchair
might be just what we need.

140
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,021
Ti-Timmy.

141
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,190
This new fourth-Grade teacher
is driving me nuts.

142
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,890
What's the problem?

143
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:30,263
You see, chef, ms. Choksondik
has very large, uh, honkers

144
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,432
And she doesn't seem to like
wearing a bra.

145
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,698
You call that
a problem?

146
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,034
That sounds like
heaven to me.

147
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,071
No, it's really not as nice
as you might imagine, chef.

148
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:40,673
Principal victoria,
i would like a word.

149
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,842
Ooh, call the doctor!

150
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,444
My new students are the most
misbehaved, illiterate,

151
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,578
Brain-Dead group of children
i've ever come across.

152
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,084
Well, ms. Choksondik, those children
did fairly well in the third grade.

153
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,686
One of them is mentally
handicapped for christ's sake!

154
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,952
Oh, which one?

155
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,121
The one
in the wheelchair!

156
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,759
Look, i would like to have a talk
with their last year's teacher.

157
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,379
Who was it,
mr. Uh, garrison?

158
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,929
I'm afraid
that's impossible.

159
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,567
Nobody's seen mr. Garrison since
the last school year ended.

160
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:08,868
Why, where did he go?

161
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,687
We... don't like
to talk about it.

162
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:14,038
But i need help
reaching these kids!

163
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,242
I have nothing but the highest
expectations for them.

164
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,543
And with god
as my witness...

165
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,810
Ohh! Ahh!

166
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,580
I'm going to teach these kids
the wonders of the world

167
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,148
So that they can
reach the top!

168
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,147
Arhh!

169
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,917
I hope that sometime very soon
you will let me in

170
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,086
On what happened
to this mr. Garrison.

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,689
And with that i will
bid you good day.

172
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,858
Well, sure thing, fine,
bye-Bye then.

173
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,197
All right, when we power up
the handicapped kid's chair

174
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,268
We'll accelerate at a high rate
of speed about 10 feet that way,

175
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,836
Then make the required
magnetic vibrations.

176
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,039
If the fields are right, it
should then create a wormhole

177
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,173
Up near the front
of the classroom.

178
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,943
You guys don't actually think
this is going to work, do you?

179
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,077
Now, when you all see
the wormhole,

180
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,114
You guys are gonna have about
4.2 seconds to run through it.

181
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,619
And on the other side, you will
find yourself in the exact same spot,

182
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,354
Only, one year ago.

183
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,089
Back in the
third grade.

184
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,355
Cool. Cool.

185
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,125
I can't wait until the
teacher yells at us this time

186
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,860
And we all tell her
to suck our balls.

187
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,994
Yeah!
Oh, here she comes.

188
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,198
All right, children, i hope you
all did your homework last night.

189
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,499
Please pass your papers
up to the front.

190
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,633
Suck my balls!

191
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,271
Oh, godammit, you guys,
i'm so seriously.

192
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,741
I said, pass your papers
to the front.

193
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,343
We didn't do our homework,
ms. Makes-Me-Sick,

194
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,043
We didn't feel like it.

195
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,115
It's choksondik, and you are
all going to have detention!

196
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,867
Ha, ha, sure right
you are, teacher.

197
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:32,585
I'm afraid we have
different plans.

198
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,851
Gentlemen.

199
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,188
Primary fusion
initiated.

200
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,923
Molecular grenadine
active.

201
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,189
What are you doing?

202
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,924
We're going back in time
to the third grade.

203
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,562
Good-Bye, teacher, perhaps we
shall see you in another year.

204
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,531
Ha ha!

205
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,383
Timmy!

206
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,201
Timmy!

207
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,407
I didn't think it
would work. Me neither.

208
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,479
Well, well, well, i'd say
somebody has some explaining to do.

209
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,179
You're damn right
they do!

210
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,515
Dude, timmy's chair's packed
with all that stuff.

211
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,033
We gotta help him!

212
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,082
Yeah, come on.

213
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,853
Children, children,
come back here!

214
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,288
Ahhh!

215
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,624
Timmy,
you have to stop.

216
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:12,890
No!
No?

217
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,192
Look, the system
malfunctioned.

218
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,395
If he stops, the nuclear core
could break his magnetic field

219
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,130
And the whole chair
will blow sky-High.

220
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,397
What?

221
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,733
Timmy, you gotta
get off that chair!

222
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:21,999
No!
No?

223
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,336
We rigged the chair to be
sensitive to his weight,

224
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,071
If he gets off
the whole thing blows.

225
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,673
So if timmy drops his speed below
five miles an hour the chair blows

226
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,408
And if he gets off
the chair blows?

227
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,577
Yep.
My god.

228
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,614
It's been over three hours since the
police first showed up on the scene

229
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,084
Of a handicap boy's wheelchair
set with explosives.

230
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,385
Over here, over here!

231
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,988
The child can't stop or get off
the chair without risking explosion

232
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,458
And so the swat team will now
attempt to disarm the device.

233
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,193
Timmy!

234
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,663
Closer!

235
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,567
Don't worry, son, just
watch your speed and stay still.

236
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,868
Look out, hanson!

237
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,603
Oh!

238
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,905
Timmy!

239
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,639
Dear jesus,
hang on lady!

240
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,941
Oh my god,
what's going on?

241
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,641
Ma'am,
be very careful,

242
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,411
That wheelchair
is set to explode.

243
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,677
What?! Ahh!

244
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,979
Oh my god,
oh my god!

245
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,050
It's okay, just stay calm
and keep the speed above five.

246
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,750
Okay, okay.

247
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,485
Oh my god.
Ti-Timmy.

248
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,821
Okay, i've got
the speed at five.

249
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,088
Good.

250
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,159
What's the wheelchair's
battery power at?

251
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,293
Oh my god, less than
20 minutes!

252
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,232
Less than 20 minutes?
Oh, no, what have we done?

253
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,268
What do you think,
too forward?

254
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,570
I have had it!

255
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:31,836
Ahh!

256
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,137
These children
are out of control.

257
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:37,510
I must speak with their last
year's teacher, mr. Garrison.

258
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,913
As we said before,
that's impossible.

259
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,281
What in god's name
happened to him?

260
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,981
Uh, ms. Choksondik,

261
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,052
Mr. Garrison had several,
uh, emotional issues.

262
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,054
He was a closet homosexual
who hated gay people.

263
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,692
When ever someone asked him
if he was gay, he'd go nuts.

264
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,596
Then he was accused of trying to
solicit sex from a young boy.

265
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,999
After being dismissed
from teaching

266
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:01,332
He went off to write
romance novels.

267
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,935
His first novel sold very well
and everything was fine

268
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,405
Until he found out that his
novel won the gay pulitzer prize

269
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,344
And was considered the best homoerotic
novel since "huckleberry finn".

270
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,512
He finally snapped and
had a nervous breakdown

271
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,115
And went up into the
mountains to live in solitude.

272
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,850
Some say that
on cold nights

273
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,453
You can still hear
him moaning,

274
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:24,157
"I'm not gay
i'm not gay."

275
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,792
I'm not gay!

276
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,527
And nobody
has found him?

277
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,731
Well, we haven't
really looked.

278
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:32,997
I see.

279
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,634
Then the only way i'll find the
secret to teaching these kids

280
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,237
Is to go up into those mountains
and find mr. Garrison myself.

281
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,840
But he could be anywhere
up high in those mountains.

282
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,106
Oh, i'll find him.

283
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,177
Even if i have to climb
up and up and up-

284
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,479
No!

285
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,745
What?

286
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,480
Oh my god,
oh my god!

287
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,900
Tom, i'm standing about
two miles outside of denver

288
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,286
Where the darling handicap boy
fights for his life

289
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,420
On a wheelchair of death.

290
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,190
Guys, can you tell us
what kind of explosives

291
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,324
We're actually
dealing with here?

292
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,528
Uh, well, it's a simple
hydrogen fusion core

293
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,396
With a veltic reactor.

294
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,131
It just turned into
a time bomb.

295
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,167
This has never happened in all the
72 original "star trek" episodes.

296
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,203
Yeah- Wait, you mean
73 episodes.

297
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,739
No, there were 72.

298
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:14,205
No there weren't!

299
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,975
Oh, you're
such a nerd!

300
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,879
Tom, i understand that now
the rescuers are gonna

301
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,314
Try and send in one of the
handicap boy's little friends

302
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,253
In an attempt to keep him calm
and hopefully disarm the device.

303
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:30,254
It's all right, everything's
gonna be fine. Oh my god!

304
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,458
All right, young man, when you
get underneath that wheelchair

305
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:34,627
I want you to relay back to me
with this walkie-Talkie

306
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:35,928
And then i'll tell you
which wires to cross.

307
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,229
Ready?
Let's go!

308
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,398
Go blue!

309
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,936
Hey guys.

310
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,206
Okay- Ahh!

311
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,713
Well, who didn't
seethatcoming?

312
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,413
Oh my god,
oh my god!

313
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,183
Stay calm,
you have to stay calm!

314
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,568
But if we get off the chair
it blows up!

315
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,520
No, no, that's only
if the boy gets off.

316
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,272
Oh... see ya!
Timmy!

317
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,990
10 seconds, hanson!

318
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,691
9, 8...

319
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,027
Please help me.

320
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,293
6, 5...

321
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,497
Got it, i think.
Up, up!

322
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,533
Timmy!

323
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,245
Hey, it did work.

324
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,296
Hellooo?

325
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,801
Oh, what am i doing,
i'm gonna get myself killed.

326
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,837
Is anyone here?

327
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,706
Mr... mr. Garrison?

328
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,910
Who are you?
What do you want?

329
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,079
I'm the new
fourth-Grade teacher,

330
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,080
I've come to
seek your help.

331
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,585
Please, i don't know how to
handle the new fourth graders,

332
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,852
I've tried everything.

333
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,787
I need to know how
you taught them.

334
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:13,409
No, no, i haven't taught
in over eight months.

335
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,996
Mr. Garrison, you knew
how to reach these kids,

336
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,297
You're my only hope.

337
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,900
Do you know what it is
to be a teacher, ms...

338
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,166
Choksondik.

339
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,467
No i don't, it's a lie!

340
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,671
You see, that's what you get
for being a teacher.

341
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,371
You work and you work
for the children

342
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,707
And then people start rumors
that you're gay

343
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,442
Even though you
love poontang!

344
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,479
Mr. Garrison, these children are
depending on me to give them a future.

345
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,081
I can't do it without your
guidance, please help me.

346
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,552
For them, for the future
of our children.

347
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,853
200 bucks.

348
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,119
Done.

349
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,889
Dude, you gotta build us
another time machine.

350
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,156
Huh? Oh, can't.

351
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,058
What do you mean "can't"?

352
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,010
You made it work,
just build another one.

353
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,528
I can't because
pizza-Face isn't here.

354
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,228
We're not on
speaking terms.

355
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,998
We got in a big fight and he
moved all his stuff out.

356
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,950
What did you get in
a fight about?

357
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,468
There's 73 original
"star treks",

358
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,169
He keeps saying
there's 72!

359
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,372
Oh, jesus christ,
you've gotta be kidding me.

360
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,107
No, he actually thinks
there's 72.

361
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,276
Look, can't you just build us
another machine without him?

362
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,844
No, pizza-Face took all his
equipment home to his mom's.

363
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,481
Now, if you can go over there and
get him to admit that he's wrong...

364
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,518
All right,
come on guys.

365
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,554
Man, i can't believe we have to do
this while timmy's already back in time.

366
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,157
Yeah, timmy's probably back in
third grade right now living it up!

367
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,496
Timmy!

368
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,266
Timmy, ahh!

369
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,472
All right,
let's try it again.

370
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,110
Children, we are now going to
do math problems.

371
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,111
But teacher, i don't want
to do my math problems.

372
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,183
You will do them or else you'll
be in very big trouble.

373
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,918
Well, i'm not goin' to
do it, teacher,

374
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,052
You can just
suck my balls.

375
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,256
Don't use that kind of
language, young man.

376
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,389
No!
No?

377
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,027
Look, you can't counter a profane
command with an idle threat.

378
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,196
You must extinguish it
with a vulgar suggestion.

379
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,798
When a child says
"suck my balls", you say,

380
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,967
"Present them".

381
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,234
Oh.

382
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,004
Now, let's try it again.

383
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,558
Suck my balls!

384
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,909
Present them.

385
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,511
Good... very good.

386
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,715
You're ready to move on
to the next level.

387
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,415
But i warn you,

388
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,053
We will now be diving deep
into your own psyche.

389
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,439
These children know
what scares you

390
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:25,391
And so, we too
must face those demons.

391
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,524
I'm ready,
i'm not afraid.

392
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,378
You will be, you will be.

393
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,198
You will be.

394
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,970
God dammit,
this is ridiculous.

395
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,271
What?

396
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,405
Dude, can you please just stop
fighting with your friend

397
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,609
And build another machine so we can
travel back in time to the third grade?

398
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,663
Look, there aren't 73 episodes
of star trek, there are 72!

399
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:49,682
"The menagerie" was a two-Parter
that counts as one episode.

400
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:50,948
Pizza-Face is wrong.

401
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,550
Who the hell cares?
I know!

402
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,286
Why does he have to be
such a dick about it it?

403
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,489
Won't it be better to just agree with
him and just forget the whole thing?

404
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,756
No, because he's wrong!

405
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,393
Look, you guys built a machine
together that can bend time.

406
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,093
If you'll just
agree with him

407
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,164
You can build another one and
usher in a whole new era of science.

408
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,201
And live in a world of 72 original
star treks? I don't think so.

409
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:12,671
I don't want to live
in that world.

410
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,840
God, these guys are such
geek dumb-Asses!

411
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,141
I know.

412
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,275
Yeah, they don't even realize
that "the menagerie"

413
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,347
Originally was the pilot and later
got split up into two episodes.

414
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,083
Those dumb-Asses.

415
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,419
Wait a minute,
i've got it.

416
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,119
What?

417
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,722
Dude, if you guys build
another time machine

418
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,926
You can travel back in time
and ask the creator of star trek

419
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,396
How many episodes
there were!

420
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:40,397
Dear jesus,
you're right.

421
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,301
This is it,
the tree of insight.

422
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,373
You must go in and
face what lives inside.

423
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:48,674
What lives inside?

424
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,276
Hell if i know,
i wouldn't go in there.

425
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,012
Alrighty.

426
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,314
Well?

427
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,687
What the
- Well, there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side.

428
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:04,254
There's nothing
in here at all.

429
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,193
Oh, and i actually thought my
mental demons would be in here.

430
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:12,097
Wait a minute, maybe there's not
supposed to be anything in here.

431
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,435
Maybe i'm supposed to see that i alone
do have the strength to reach the kids.

432
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,339
I think i get it now.

433
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,544
Hey, hurry up
in there!

434
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,014
Jesus, you're taking too long
in the damn tree of insight!

435
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,883
You in there?

436
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,954
Hey, where the hell
did she go?

437
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,340
What the?

438
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,292
Ahh!

439
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,426
Who-Who are you?

440
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,497
I am you,
i am your gay side.

441
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,100
My gay side...
i don't have a gay side!

442
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,136
You must face me
at last.

443
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,209
You aren't real,
you can't be.

444
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:01,113
It is me, your darkest fear,
your gay self incarnate.

445
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,379
What do you want?

446
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,583
I want you to not
fight me anymore,

447
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,752
To accept me
once and for all.

448
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,452
Why?
Don't you see?

449
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,656
All these years,
your pain, your confusion-

450
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,126
It comes from one place,
your denial of who you are,

451
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:15,861
Of whoweare.

452
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,464
But i'm not gay,
everyone just thinks i am.

453
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,730
Oh, stop it!

454
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,031
What about the time
you looked at

455
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,669
Counselor mackie's penis
in the men's locker room?

456
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,421
I was just
comparing size!

457
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:27,104
For seven minutes?
Ah!

458
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,839
And what about the
time you masturbated

459
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,477
To the men's 100-Meter
swimming relay at the olympics?

460
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,212
I was beating off
to the chicks.

461
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:34,478
There were no chicks!

462
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,116
Oh, damn you, spirit,
haunt me no longer!

463
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,382
Admit it!
No!

464
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,586
You have to stop lying
to yourself and get-

465
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,321
All right, all right,
i admit it.

466
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,490
I'm gay!

467
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,092
I'm... gay.

468
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,261
I'm gay.

469
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,961
I am gay!

470
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,334
You hear that, everyone?
I'm gay, i'm gay!

471
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,370
I'm gay and it-
And it feels good.

472
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,142
All right, children,
i hope you all did your-

473
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:05,709
What is going on now?

474
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,780
Ha ha, teacher, we're traveling
back in time to third grade.

475
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,516
Godammit, you guys,
you seriously said this time

476
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:11,834
You'd stand up
and do it with me.

477
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,578
Oh, good gravy,
not this again.

478
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,252
Yes, we had
anewtime machine built,

479
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,288
This one out of a simple
microwave oven and a duck.

480
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,360
Au revoir, teacher, perhaps we
shall see you in the past, ha ha.

481
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,192
Gentlemen...

482
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,494
Children, i will
have order!

483
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,662
I can't wait for gene roddenberry
to tell you how wrong you are.

484
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,734
Just like when you said there were no
two-Parters of "battlestar galactica".

485
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,434
There weren't!

486
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,638
The episode called "guys on ice
planet zero" was a two-Parter!

487
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:33,939
No, it wasn't!

488
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh, son of
a bitch.

489
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,542
I'll kill you!

490
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,963
There it is,
come on everybody.

491
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:44,349
Children, get back
into your seats.

492
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,451
No way, lady.

493
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:46,483
Eric, i mean it.

494
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,687
You can suck my balls.

495
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,591
Present them.

496
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,026
What?

497
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,327
You said,
"suck my balls".

498
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,832
Well, go ahead, whip 'em out
and i'll suck 'em.

499
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,303
Tha- That's what
mr. Garrison would've said.

500
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,471
Touch?, teacher, touch?.

501
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,207
Now, children,
listen to me.

502
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,340
Why do you want to
go back in time?

503
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,943
Life isn't about going back,
it's about going forward.

504
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,014
Yes, there are times in our life
that we wish we could relive,

505
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,051
But if we already lived them
perfectly, why live them again?

506
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,087
The adventure of life is that
there's always something new-

507
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,221
New challenges,
new experiences.

508
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,292
A fun game is a game that
gets harder as it goes.

509
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,762
So it is with life.
Do you understand?

510
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,165
Dude... she's right.

511
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,499
Yeah, and you know,

512
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,703
Now that i think about it, third
grade wasn't all that great either.

513
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,403
Yeah, third grade
sucked!

514
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,040
Cartman, why the hell did you try to
make us think third grade was so great?

515
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,342
Yeah, you suck,
cartman.

516
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:44,608
What?

517
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,378
All right, students,
that will be quite enough.

518
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,644
If you're ready,

519
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,583
Let's continue on
with the fourth grade.

520
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,717

You know, i feel like
i can start anew.
