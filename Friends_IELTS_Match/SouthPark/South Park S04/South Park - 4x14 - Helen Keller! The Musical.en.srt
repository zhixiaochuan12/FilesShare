Oh, my poor
little helen!

00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,179

Can we take
a lunch break now?

29
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,661
No, if we want our play to be
better than the kindergartner's play,

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,396
We have to rehearse
as much as possible!

31
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,264
Now let's continue
the scene!

32
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:05,999
Hello, my name is
anne sullivan

33
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,035

this child to communicate.

34
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,336
Eally, you hink so?

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,373

Hagh, timmy!

37
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,843
Dammit, timmy, helen keller
isn't supposed to talk!

38
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,747
You guys, we've got
a big problem!

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,447
What is it, butters?

40
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,651
The kindergartners, i just came
from their dress rehearsal!

41
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,386
Oh it's good, you guys,
it's real good!

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,687
How good?

43
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,821
They've got pilgrim outfits
and indian ones too!

44
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,459
They've got singing and dancing, and
boy, you've never seen such a show!

45
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,194
Why, it's a thanksgiving
extravaganza!

46
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,495
Oh no!

47
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,230
We can't be outdone
by the kindergartners!

48
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,496
No!
We can't!

49
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,798
Alright, alright,
quiet down!

50
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,568
Look, we've still got four days
until the thanksgiving festival.

51
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,303
That's plenty of time
to revamp our play!

52
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,472
Revamp how, the rules are
that the fourth-Grade class

53
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,172
Has to perform
"the helen keller story"!

54
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,907
Yeah, but nobody told us
howwe have to do it.

55
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,111
We can add thanksgiving stuff
and music numbers too!

56
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,811
Well, we can
add music numbers,

57
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,014
But how do we make the helen
keller story more thanksgiving-Y?

58
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,316
I know, how about
instead of a dog...

59
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,016
Helen keller has
a pet turkey!

60
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,352
Yeah, a turkey that
can do tricks!

61
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,052
Yeah!
That's the spirit, gang!

62
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,256
Alright, stan and wendy, you go out
and find some musical instruments!

63
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,956
Kenny and clyde
take some kids

64
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,726
And buy some thanksgiving
decorations for the sets!

65
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,426
Kyle and timmy, you go out
and find a turkey!

66
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,630
This is gonna be the best version
of "the miracle worker" ever!

67
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:11,931
Yea!
Yea!

68
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,703
What kind of turkey
are you looking for?

69
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,403
A smart one that
can do tricks!

70
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,474
Well, i ain't got a whole lot left,
it being almost thanksgiving and all.

71
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,209
But go ahead,
just pick one out.

72
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,451
Timmy!

73
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,620
Oh, that one's
a little messed up.

74
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,355
Not exactly the pick
of the litter.

75
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,621
Hahgh!

76
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,825
Uh, timmy, if we go back to
other kids with that turkey,

77
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,126
They're gonna be pissed.

78
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,392
Timmy!

79
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,729
Yeah, best you not
take that one.

80
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,898
I was just about to take it out in
the yard and put a bullet in its head.

81
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,066
What, aw, dude,
don't say that!

82
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,333
Timmy, timmy!

83
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,502
Alright, we'll take him,
how much? Fifty bucks.

84
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,705
But you were just gonna take it in the
backyard and put a bullet in its head!

85
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,308
I know, now i gotta find
something else to shoot!

86
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,043
Goddammit, here!

87
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,213
Alright, timmy,
let's go.

88
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,550
I've got a one-Legged pig
if you'd like, too.

89
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,285
Aw, blow it
out your ass!

90
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,021
Guys, i want you all to
meet geoffrey maynard.

91
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,225
He's south park's biggest
expert on musical theater

92
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,359
And he played the lead
inles miserables

93
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,996
At the denver community
playhouse for five weeks!

94
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,033
Do you think we can make up a good
thanksgiving play in four days?

95
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,733
? I would swear it
on my life?

96
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,937
? Your play shall
want for nothing?

97
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:25,203
Hooray!
Hooray!

98
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,274
Now, the first thing any good
musical needs is a big opening number!

99
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,842
Something that sets up
the entire show.

100
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,913
Alright, places everybody,
bring in the turkey!

101
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,986
What the hell
is that?

102
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,155
It's a turkey.

103
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,191
His name is gobbles.

104
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,457
Gobbles!

105
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,963
And where, pray, is our
beautiful trick-Performing turkey?

106
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:53,433
Um, we sort of spent all
the money on this one.

107
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,168
Gobbles!

108
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,072
Kyle, can i talk to you
over here for a second?

109
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,108
Kyle, why do you do
these things to me?

110
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,409
I didn't do
anything to you!

111
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,144
Timmy saw the turkey
and wanted to get it.

112
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,411
What did you want me
to say to him?

113
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,013
You say "no, timmy, you can't
have that turkey, bad timmy!"

114
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,217
Look, i know it isn't exactly what
we wanted, but maybe we can train it.

115
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,917
He's not
gonna work, kyle.

116
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,121
The whole point is to make our
play better than the kindergartners!

117
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,422
Yeah, that turkey sucks.

118
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,689
Wait...

119
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,990
? What's that you say?

120
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,760
? A thanksgiving turkey
is what you require?

121
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,061
? I know of a turkey?

122
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,328
You do?!

123
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,664
? During my years
on broadway?

124
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,267
? I worked with a turkey that
could do all kinds of tricks?

125
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:29,869
? She even jumped through
a hoop of fire?

126
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,135
Cool, can you
get it for us?

127
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,304
? I will go promptly
and call her trainer?

128
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,942
? On the morrow you shall have
your trick performing turkey?

129
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,243
Alright!
Alright!

130
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,316
Gobbles!

131
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,521
Gobbles!

132
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,463
Ergh, ergh.

133
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,667
Hargh, gobbles!

134
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,173
Gobbles.

135
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,511
Gobbles!

136
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,150
No, no, no!

137
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,717
Poopsiekins, it's late,
you need to be in bed.

138
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,355
I can't sleep, mom, i have to
write the lyrics to the opening song

139
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,090
Of our helen keller
thanksgiving spectacular.

140
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,356
Now, hon.

141
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,658
But mom!

142
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,428
I have to write these lyrics
so the plight of helen keller

143
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,180
Can be realized
by the common ma-An!

144
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,898
Twenty more minutes
and that's it.

145
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,934
Twenty minutes, did tim rice's
mom give him twenty minutes

146
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,103
To write the lyrics to
phantom of the opera?!

147
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,441
Speak to me, helen.

148
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,176
Let me be
your voice.

149
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,212
Come on, you blind bitch,
channel your spirit through me!

150
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,973
Tonight, we present the story
of a courageous girl

151
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,142
And her fight against
depression.

152
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,244
Oppression!

153
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,276
Oppression.

154
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,612
Our play begins in
a simpler time.

155
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,781
Alabama,
in the late 1800s...

156
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,817
? 1800s?

157
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,685
? Alabama?

158
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,385
? What a great
place in time?

159
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,372
? We're so happy that
we live in 1800s alabama?

160
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,324
? 'Cause it's sunny and
there is no crime?

161
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,625
Now to the refrain!

162
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,360
? And in our little town
of 1800s alabama?

163
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,494
? There's a family
by the name of keller?

164
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,264
? Their daughter's deaf and mute
and blind as a bat?

165
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,832
? And her parents
can't even tell her?

166
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,903
Excuse me, i am lamonde,
the animal trainer.

167
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,169
Oh cool,
he's here!

168
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,807
Awesome, do you have a turkey
that can do tricks?!

169
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,542
Ahp, ahp, do not
call them "tricks".

170
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,277
She's a very
sensitive turkey,

171
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,411
And she performs
"feats" not "tricks".

172
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,482
Ladies and gentlemen, may i present
the most beautiful bird in america.

173
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,519
Four-Time prize winner at
the national western stock show

174
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,555
And reigning poster child
of turkeylovers.Com.

175
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,724
I give you...
alinicia!

176
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,159
Oooh!
Whoa! Wow!

177
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,894
Her feathers
are beautiful!

178
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,664
That's the prettiest
turkey i ever saw.

179
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,399
Of course she is.

180
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,436
Okay, now we can really
get this thing underway!

181
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,604
Places, everybody,
where the hell is timmy?

182
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,506
Timmy!

183
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,076
What is that?

184
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,713
Uh, that's gobbles, the
physically challenged turkey.

185
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,268
Gobbles!

186
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:33,751
Gobbles?

187
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,521
Timmy, we already
got a turkey.

188
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,256
Yeah, and it's
from broadway!

189
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,390
Gobbles!

190
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,559
No, timmy, the handicapped
turkey does not go in our play!

191
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,763
Dude, don't forget, timmy's the
only kid who can play helen keller.

192
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,029
Don't piss him off.

193
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,365
That's right, only timmy
knows the part.

194
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,065
Timmy.

195
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,367
Oh, jesus,
okay, fine!

196
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,137
Helen keller can
have two pet turkeys!

197
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,474
My turkey does not work
with other turkeys!

198
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,643
Oh, goddammit,
now what are we gonna do?

199
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,168
Alright, alright.

200
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:07,620
Alright, alright!

201
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,006
Dude, we need your
turkey for our play!

202
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,958
She's not coming out,
she's very upset.

203
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,493
She's pooped
all over the room.

204
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:14,959
I know, i know,
but listen.

205
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,295
Let me try to explain
the position i'm in here.

206
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,429
The retarded turkey
belongs to our friend timmy,

207
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,199
And timmy is the only person who
knows the part of helen keller.

208
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,368
So tell me what i can do here
to make everybody happy.

209
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,936
Kill the other turkey.

210
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,706
I can't, dude,
timmy has a boner for it.

211
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,441
Well, it could
meet with an...

212
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:29,742
Unfortunate accident.

213
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,043
Unfortunate accident?

214
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,212
You mean like geena davis
getting her own t.V. Show?

215
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,531
Ha ha ha- Oh...

216
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:35,780
It's very simple.

217
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,550
Either that turkey meets with
an unfortunate accident,

218
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,719
Or you don't have
a feat-Performing turkey

219
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,454
For your helen keller
thanksgiving musical!

220
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,189
Alright, alright,
just get your turkey

221
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,225
To stop crapping all over the dressing
room and come out for rehearsal.

222
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,411
I'll take care
of everything.

223
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,589
Water, helen,
it has a name!

224
00:08:50,624 --> 00:08:52,732
Oh, why can't
you understand?!

225
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,866
Duh, agh!

226
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,202
? Wat-Er he-Len
wa-Ter?

227
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:57,468
? She's never gonna do it?

228
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,238
? There's no way
she'll ever do it?

229
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,938
? Spell it helen
water helen?

230
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,275
? How can she talk
if she can't hear?

231
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,576
? This is absolutely
pointless?

232
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,842
Okay, uh, hold it!

233
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,577
Let's hold it
right there a second.

234
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,215
Okay, i just want to adjust
some of the blocking real quick.

235
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,915
Let's see...

236
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,685
Uh, why don't we have
turkey number two

237
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,721
Stand just a little
more over m'yha...

238
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,191
Let's see, maybe a little bit
more up in m'yha...

239
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,095
And just a wee bit
over m'yha...

240
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,132
And right about...

241
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,867
M'hya.

242
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,469
There we go,
good.

243
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,410
Oh my gah,
ey killed kenny!

244
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:38,676
Ooohhh!

245
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,446
Crap, i must have rigged
the wrong light.

246
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,580
? Let him rest?

247
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,000
? In peace
let him rest?

248
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:47,386
? Why must he die...?

249
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,724
They've got special effects!

250
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,424
What, butters?

251
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,628
The kindergartners, they've
got amazing stage effects!

252
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:56,894
Pyrotechnics and
what have yous!

253
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,664
Why, it's a regular
feast for the eyes!

254
00:09:58,699 --> 00:09:59,497
Oh no!

255
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,267
We're never gonna
outdo them now!

256
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,585
Oh no!
Special effects?!

257
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,869
Calm down, calm down!

258
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,604
We can have
special effects too!

259
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,906
Now i know a lot
is going wrong,

260
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,075
But we've got to stick together
to make this play work.

261
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,208
All of us.

262
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,846
? And into your hands...?

263
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,486
Gobbles!

264
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,256
Aaahh, gobbles!

265
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,293
Little boy!

266
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,611
Timmy.

267
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:29,860
Yes, tim.

268
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,596
I feel i must
speak with you.

269
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,016
The others, well, they don't
want you to know, but-

270
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,402
Oh, i don't know what to do,
should i tell you?

271
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:37,269
Timmy?

272
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,403
I feel i'm the only one
who can be honest with you.

273
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,342
The animal shelter is on its way
to take your turkey away from you.

274
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,609
Gobbles?!

275
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,680
You see, they don't allow
children in your "situation"

276
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,814
To have wild animals
as pets.

277
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,451
You can't take him running,
you can't take care of him.

278
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,186
They have to
take it away.

279
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,453
Gobbles!

280
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,657
They take wild pets away
from people like you

281
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,259
And hand them over
for experiments.

282
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,163
And they're shocked,
dissected and flayed

283
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,863
While they're
still alive.

284
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,934
And no matter where you go the
shelter people will find you.

285
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,537
The only way for that turkey
to avoid years of torture,

286
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,007
Is for you to let him go,
back into the wild.

287
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,610
Oh no,
here they come now!

288
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,646
Quick, go and set
your turkey free!

289
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,381
I'll try to stall them.

290
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,081
Timmy!

291
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,153
Excuse me, we're here to install
the water effects for the musical.

292
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,888
The stage is right
through there.

293
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,623
Thanks.

294
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,696
Alright, i've got to
write the new lyrics.

295
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:38,431
Let's see...

296
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,382
No, no!

297
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:41,901
Goddammit!

298
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,601
? How is it going eric?

299
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,371
Terrible, i can't write
the lyrics for the third act.

300
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,071
Nothing's coming to me!

301
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,275
Well, you know, in theater
sometimes we try different tricks

302
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,010
To get the creative
juices flowing.

303
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,276
Like what?

304
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,480
Let's see, helen keller
was blind and deaf,

305
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,449
Perhaps you should see
what it is like.

306
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,349
? Deprive yourself
of your senses?

307
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,986
? And see what plays
inside your mind?

308
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:01,819
Here.

309
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,155
Hey, that's not
a bad idea.

310
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,855
? Just relax?

311
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,360
? Just try to let your mind
wander and let the juices flow?

312
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,653
Oh, man!

313
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,954
Well, did you
see anything?

314
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,158
No, just the same old crap i
always see when i close my eyes.

315
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:40,910
Oh, that's too bad.

316
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,593
Wait, i've got it!

317
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,797
The perfect setup for when
helen keller's pet turkey

318
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,532
Jumps through
the hoop of fire!

319
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,399
Yes!

320
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,135
Yes, i have it now!

321
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,509
The only way for that turkey
to avoid years of torture,

322
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,642
Is for you to let him go.

323
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,412
Let him go...
let him go.

324
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,051
Gobbles.

325
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,823
Gobbles!

326
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,293
Gobbles.

327
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,462
Gobbles!

328
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,800
Gobbles!

329
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,836
Timmy.

330
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,438
Timmy, gobbles.

331
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,367
Daddy, why did mommy leave
and go to heaven?

332
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,187
She didn't want to, kevin,
she had no choice.

333
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:43,355
But i miss her.

334
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,428
I could have done so much
more with my life, son.

335
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,429
I've wasted it.

336
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,633
Not ever telling
you and monica

337
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,368
I love you.

338
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,671
Robbie!

339
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,441
Robbie, no!

340
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,911
Because now every time
i look at you...

341
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,045
I see her.

342
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,815
I have to move on.

343
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,550
Kelly, please,
don't do this.

344
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,817
I'm sorry!

345
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,587
Then why did you do it?

346
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,322
I don't know!

347
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,028
Have you done the right
things in your life?

348
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,770
Hi, sheila!

349
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,540
Hello, sharon,
where's your husband?

350
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,806
He's in the back.

351
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,444
He set up a video camera so that
he could tape the performance.

352
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,179
Oh, so did gerald.

353
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,432
Oh yeah, i got
a great angle here.

354
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,915
Hey gerald,
maybe after the show

355
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,119
We can make copies of each
other's tapes, so we have both.

356
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,637
Good idea!

357
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:49,687
So wait...

358
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,023
Do we do the spin around thing
on the last beat?

359
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,723
No, ude, on ne n
and ne hree.

360
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,059
You ready for
the big show, timmy?

361
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,361
Where's gobbles, timmy?

362
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:56,627
Gobbles.

363
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,397
Alright, everybody,
let's take our places!

364
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,132
Cartman, where is
timmy's turkey?

365
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,398
I don't know.

366
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,168
I don't know,
you guys!

367
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,771
Alright, maybe i tried to have
timmy's turkey crushed by a stagelight,

368
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,940
But i didn't do anything else,
i'm not an asshole!

369
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,909
You're going to
be brilliant!

370
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,809
You sexy,
gorgeous turkey.

371
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,579
With that other meddling
animal out of the way,

372
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,314
You'll steal the show!

373
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,158
Well, well, what are
you doing out here?

374
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,893
You shouldn't be out
walking the streets.

375
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,883
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th
annual south park thanksgiving pageant.

376
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:53,052
Every year the 4th graders
do "the miracle worker",

377
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,185
And every year i have to
sit and watch it.

378
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,389
Yeah, i swore that if i had
to see it one more time,

379
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,089
I'd put a bullet
in my head.

380
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,692
But luckily i got really
stoned before i came.

381
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,763
And now here it is, the
touching story of helen keller,

382
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,498
"The miracle worker".

383
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,486
? Helen keller helen keller
blind as a bat?

384
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,872
? She can't hear or speak
what's up with that?

385
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,607
This is
"the miracle worker"?

386
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,874
I...

387
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,210

She's brilliant,
everyone loves her so far!

405
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,013
Hey, the fountains you guys installed
are shorting out some of our lights!

406
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,314
Look, we're only here to
do the water effects.

407
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,049
We're not in charge
of electrical.

408
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,784
That's a different union.

409
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,051
Timmy?

410
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,821

Where is timmy,

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,135
He's gone, dude, butters

417
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,401
Leave, leave?!

418
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,171
But nobody else knows
the part of helen keller!

419
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,140
I do,

420
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,040

There is nothing we can do
for our poor daughter.

427
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,462
We cannot reach her.

428
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,281
? I cannot hear what
they are saying?

429
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,632
? I cannot tell them
how i feel?

430
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,836
What the hell is he doing, helen
keller isn't supposed to sing!

431
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,873
? If only i could say
things that go on in my mind?

432
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,174
Oh, wow!

433
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,993

Hagh!

00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,538
Oh, thank god

442
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,839
It was an accident,
i swear!

443
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,008
Is there any way we can
make it up to you?

444
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:37,743

00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,744

Where the turkey jumps

Okay, here we go.
