? Friendly faces
everywhere?

5
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,681
? Humble folks
without temptation?

6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,217
? Going down
to south park?

7
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:18,852
? Gonna leave my
woes behind?

8
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,453
? Ample parking
day or night?

00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,188
? People spouting
"howdy neighbor"?

10
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,140

to south park?

11
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:25,658

to south park?

13
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,598
? And meet some
friends of mine?

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:50,550
He's gonna be here
any minute, ike.

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,117
Oh no, poopie.

16
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,321
He might not come if you're too
close to the toilet bowl, ike.

17
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,490
Come sit by me.

18
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,961
It's getting late, boys,

19
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,263
Why don't you
come on up to bed.

20
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,033
Just let us stay up
a little longer, mom,

21
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,768
Mr. Hankey's gotta show up,
he always does.

22
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,102
All right, boobie.

23
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,973
Oh, and boys,
happy chanukah.

24
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,708
Happy chanukah, mom.

25
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:36,529
Wee, wee.

26
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,446
Go away!

27
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,341
Stan, go get
the other guys

28
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,978
And tell them to meet me
at the bus stop in 10 minutes.

29
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,316
Okay, good,
you're all here.

30
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,582
What's this
all about, kyle?

31
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,918
It's mr. Hankey,
he hasn't shown up yet!

32
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,052
Oh, jesus christ,
i'm going back to bed.

33
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,822
It's only three days until
christmas, you guys.

34
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,522
You know how bad things
have been around here.

35
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,509
I think it might be because
mr. Hankey hasn't come.

36
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,426
Kyle, i have a full day
of watching tv tomorrow,

37
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:44,196
I don't have time to go on
a poo hunt right now, okay?

38
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,498
If you guys want there
to be a christmas

39
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,667
You better come help me.

40
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,837
Heh-Choo!

41
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,138
Dude, you sneezed
on my back!

42
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,439
Oh sorry, you might
get some germs

43
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:57,209
While you're walking around
in human feces.

44
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,944
Hey, look!

45
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,681
Hello?

46
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,318
Howww-Dy ho!

47
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,187
Mr. Hankey!
Oh, we were so worried.

48
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:11,524
I was waiting up for you and you
didn't come so i thought that-

49
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:13,475
Oh no,
i'm fine, kyle.

50
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,959
But where have you been?

51
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,260
Things aren't the same
without you.

52
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,596
Nobody seems to have
the christmas spirit.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,863
Oh, i know, kyle.

54
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,500
I've just been awful busy
with my family.

55
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,602
Honey!

56
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:23,634
Family?

57
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,404
Boys, i want you to meet
my wife, autumn.

58
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,538
Howdy hey, kids.

59
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,839
Would you like
a drink?

60
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,609
They're too young
to drink, honey.

61
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,309
Oh hell,
it's christmas.

62
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,513
Oh, and you have to meet
the little nuggets, too.

63
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,381
Kids!

64
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,550
This is our son
cornwallis.

65
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,684
Howww-Dy ho!

66
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,454
Our daughter amber.

67
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,720
Howdy ho!

68
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,056
And our son simon.

69
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,190
Nnn, hey!

70
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:50,129
Simon's not so smart, he was
born with a peanut in his head.

71
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,448
What's that, pa?

72
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:52,732
Nothin', simon.

73
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,998
A family!

74
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,202
So that's why you haven't been
able to spread christmas cheer.

75
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,468
It sure has been tough.

76
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,672
Nobody seems that into
christmas up there.

77
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,858
I know, it's like it
doesn't matter anymore.

78
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,009
My mom's barely bought me
any presents so far.

79
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,710
Well, don't worry kids.

80
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm sending the nuggets
up tomorrow

81
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,746
To spread christmas cheer.

82
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,516
And if you want,
you can help them.

83
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,782
Sure we'll help!

84
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,084
Anything for more
presents!

85
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,854
Woo hoo,
it's a christmas party!

86
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,554
Hey, you boys.

87
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,191
You boys wanna bet me i won't
take off my clothes?

88
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,794
Honey, please,
you're-You're drunk, okay.

89
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,529
But it's christmas, baby!

90
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,132
Honey, can we go inside
for a second?

91
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,734
Now when people come over...

92
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,711
Well, it's decided, kids,

93
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:43,048
Tomorrow we're gonna bring back
the spirit of christmas!

94
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,255
Ho, ho, ho!

95
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,990
Merry christmas, you guys.

96
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,760
Only three
shopping days until-

97
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,894
God dammit!

98
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,664
Hey, merry christmas,
asshole!

99
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,399
Nobody's paying
any attention.

100
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,267
Look out!

101
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,834
Eww, i almost
stepped in it!

102
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,604
Well, it was
a good effort, boys,

103
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,339
But i'm gonna have to
close shop.

104
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:09,508
Nobody's buying anything
and i can't afford

105
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,243
To keep this
furnace runnin'!

106
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:14,713
Oh, and boys, there's some crap
on the sidewalk there, watch out.

107
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:17,715
Not one toy.

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,919
I guess this year everyone's
content to celebrate

109
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:22,087
With candles and love.

110
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,089
This is hopeless.

111
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,425
We're just gonna have to face
that the commercialism

112
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,125
Has been sucked
out of christmas.

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,329
And in other news tonight,
it appears that everyone

114
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,932
Is officially
sick of christmas!

115
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,836
In anspcpoll, 38% said they were
fed up and tired of the holiday.

116
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,004
5% said they were
indifferent to it.

117
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,138
And a whopping 57%

118
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:43,776
Said they would kick bon jovi
square in the balls

119
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,476
If given the opportunity.

120
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,113
Well, i think people are just
fed up with the crowded shopping

121
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,415
And the
credit card bills.

122
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,982
I think that the holiday
just has become a joke.

123
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,752
Y'know, it's just that a lot of
people don't really believe

124
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,921
In the whole "jesus" thing
anymore, y'know.

125
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,789
So what's to celebrate?

126
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,524
Oh yeah, right in the
balls, man,

127
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,224
Right square
in the balls.

128
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,078
Well, the holiday spirit
may be gone from south park,

129
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,898
But at least our faith
in each other remains strong.

130
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,067
Oh, really?

131
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,886
Dude, change the channel,
this is too depressing.

132
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,272
Good grief, we need a
christmas tree for our play.

133
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,007
Oh jesus, not
this thing again.

134
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,575
How come everyone in cartoons
has such big heads?

135
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,080
All right, everyone, we've got
to get on with our play.

136
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,346
Jesus, this sucks!

137
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,647
All they keep doing
is dancing around.

138
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,634
Yeah, this thing really falls
apart in the second act.

139
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,586
And why is it- That on
"charlie brown" cartoons-

140
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,286
Everyone talks-
Like this?

141
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,056
My mom could make a better
christmas special than this.

142
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,358
Hey, that's it!

143
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,309
Oh my god,
that's totally it!

144
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:35,793
It's so simple.
What, dude?

145
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,563
We can get everyone back
into the christmas spirit

146
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,165
By making our very own
animated christmas special

147
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,901
And showing it
to everybody in town.

148
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,636
We don't know anything
about animation.

149
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,371
How hard can it be?
Look at it?

150
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,637
Hey, yeah!

151
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,806
We can make a little animated
santa claus and jesus.

152
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,443
And it can star us instead of
these little round-Headed guys.

153
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,710
Hell yeah, awesome!

154
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,649
Yeah, and we can call it...
"the spirit of christmas."

155
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,120
Oh, this is
terrible, johnson.

156
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,757
Our whole town's economy
is going right in the toilet.

157
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,360
We've got to get everybody
back in the christmas spirit.

158
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,529
Mayor, some adorable children
are here to see you.

159
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,229
Muh- Send them in.

160
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,266
Mayor, we have the solution
to your problem. You do?

161
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,903
We're gonna make make a short animated
christmas card that everyone can watch

162
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,638
And play it at the screen
at the old drive-In.

163
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,905
It'll have everything-
Jesus, santa.

164
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,675
And when people see it they'll
just have to get in the spirit.

165
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,410
All we need is
$300 for our budget.

166
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,379
An animated
christmas card!

167
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:28,279
Kids, that just might be

168
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,350
Thedumbest idea
i've ever heard, ever!

169
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:32,616
Aww. Aww.

170
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,386
But at this point
i'm willing to try anything.

171
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,121
Johnson, cut 'em
a check for $300.

172
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:36,989
All right! All right!

173
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,158
You guys go tell butters
to start making the cutouts.

174
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,327
I'm gonna go tell mr. Hankey
the good news.

175
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,328
You put the vase down!

176
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,098
Put that vase down,
that's an expensive vase!

177
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,267
Don't you
throw that vase!

178
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,268
Uh, mr. Hankey!

179
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,340
Oh, kyle,
howww-Dy ho!

180
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:55,606
We got the money,
mr. Hankey,

181
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,376
We're gonna make our
animated christmas card.

182
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,076
Oh, that's swell!

183
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,679
Kids, christmas
is back on!

184
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,750
We gotta all get that old
drive-In working again.

185
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,617
Okay! Okay!

186
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,786
That's not only thing
we gotta get working again,

187
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,088
If you know what i mean.

188
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,221
Why, why do you,
why do you have to

189
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,774
Say things like that
in front of people?

190
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,293
Well, i've gotta go
start our animation.

191
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,028
We've only got two days!

192
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:16,860
Good luck, kyle,

193
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,197
And we'll have that
projector working,

194
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,932
Don't you worry!

195
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,968
Whcornwallis?Ter,

196
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,005
All right, butters,
let's see what you've got.

197
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,306
Oh, well okay.

198
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,475
Now don't expect too much
with the budget you gave me.

199
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,008
Yeah, yeah, yeah-
Just let us see 'em.

200
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,379
Well, all right, here's a little
construction paper santa claus.

201
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,512
"Ho ho ho there, kids.

202
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,716
Would you like some
toys and stuff?"

203
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,850
Ah, and uh,
here's a little jesus.

204
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,488
"Hey there, santa, i'm the light
of the way and stuff."

205
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,090
"Oh, okay, that's good,
i suppose."

206
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,560
And here's the cutout versions
of you guys.

207
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,827
Whoa. Whoa.

208
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,163
Heh-Heh, look,
he made stan all fat.

209
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,464
That's not me, that's you! What!

210
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:53,731
They kind of
look like us.

211
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,934
I mean, stan's got blue eyes
and i've got a sharper nose,

212
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,253
But they kind of
look like us.

213
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,537
I am not that
goddamn fat!

214
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,838
Good job, butters.

215
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,441
Oh, uh, hey, i made a little
cutout version of me, too.

216
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,610
In case you need it
for your animated film.

217
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,911
No, that's okay.

218
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:06,779
See ya!

219
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,947
Oh, all right,
all right then.

220
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,153
"Oh, hey there, good-Looking,
what's your name?"

221
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,419
"Ah, butters, ma'am."

222
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,057
"Oh, butters, would you like to
slap my titties around?"

223
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,757
Whoa, well, ah...

224
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,262
No thanks, ma'am,
i'll get in trouble again.

225
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,334
Cornwallis, we've got to go
fix up the drive-In.

226
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,303
I don't want to, dad,
i'm too sad.

227
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,203
Hey, it's all right,
cornwallis,

228
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:36,275
Those boys' animated movie will
bring back the spirit of christmas.

229
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,975
It's not that father,
it's-

230
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,612
I don't feel like i'm
really a part of christmas.

231
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,666
But son, you're a hankey,
we love christmas.

232
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:46,685
Come on, it's time to
sit around the tree!

233
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,220
We're having
a talk, honey.

234
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,686
Goddammit,
it's christmas,

235
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,890
And we're gonna be a happy
family around the tree.

236
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,192
Autumn, you're drunk,
all right,

237
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,926
Now just go help
the other kids,

238
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,193
They can't get
their stockings up.

239
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,264
That's not only thing that
can't get up around here.

240
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,867
Now come on, son,
don't be so down.

241
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,036
Why? We're just
pieces of crap.

242
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,170
Christmas isn't for us.

243
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,072
Christmas is about
feeling good.

244
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,307
That's for everybody!

245
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,508
I see the nativity-

246
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,843
There's angels, shepherds
and sheep, but no poo.

247
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,012
All the christmas movies-
Santa, elves, reindeer-

248
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,712
No poo, i'm not
a part of it.

249
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:17,916
No, you're not
a part of it, cornwallis,

250
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,085
You're all of it,
don't you see?

251
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,404
I'm nothing but crap.

252
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:22,653
But crap is everything.

253
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,592
? Everything that lives on earth
poos in some way?

254
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,760
? And that's how
the cycle happens?

255
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,894
? Each and every day?

256
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,664
? Just look at
the green, green grass?

257
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,798
? And the birds
up in the sky?

258
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:40,038
? It's all here because of poo
now i'll tell you why?

259
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,224
? Grass is eaten
by the cattle?

260
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,341
? Which is eaten
by women and men?

261
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,846
? It fuses with their bodies
and becomes poo again?

262
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,032
? And that poo goes through
the sewer?

263
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,210
? Where it's dumped
into the sea?

264
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,817
? And it's eaten
by the plankton?

265
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:57,354
? That becomes
the fishes' meal?

266
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,510
? Then that bigger fish
with the poo still inside?

267
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:05,596
? Swims up near the shore
and gets eaten alive?

268
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:10,402
? By a grizzly bear that poos
on a dead piece of sand?

269
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:15,174
? So it can spring to life
and become food for the land?

270
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,776
? It's the poo
of the antelope?

271
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,476
? The poo of the giraffe?

272
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,645
? That falls
onto the earth?

273
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,632
? And becomes
the blades of grass?

274
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,584
? The grass is eaten
by the cattle?

275
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,718
? Which comes out
the other end?

276
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:32,524
? To make poo for the humans
and start all over again?

277
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,428
You see, son, you're not an
insignificant part of life,

278
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,128
You are life.

279
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,200
But how can i be that giraffe
and blade of grass and a human?

280
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,900
I don't control
what they do.

281
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,754
Just like your heart beats
without you thinking about it,

282
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,574
So, too, your giraffes and
your humans do what they do

283
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,707
Without you even
thinking about it.

284
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,646
But it is all one life form,
it is all... you.

285
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,780
I think i see now.

286
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,201
? I'm the poo
of the antelope?

287
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,552
? That flows
onto the ground?

288
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,322
? Becomes the grass of tomorrow? ? Yeah?

289
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,455
? Which the grazers
turn around?

290
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,394
? So i'm the leg of a leopard
and the wings of the hen?

291
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:11,563
? Which becomes
dinner for the humans?

292
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,166
? And turns back
to poo again?

293
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,866
? Mm-Hmm?

294
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:21,106
? That's the cycle
the cycle of poo?

295
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,409
Okay,
here's the script.

296
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,144
But it doesn't have
an ending. No ending?

297
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,879
Well, we can't animate until
we have our voices recorded,

298
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,083
So we better just record what we
have and figure out the ending later.

299
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,384
Okay, talk directly
into the mike

300
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,252
And don't hit any
hard "p"s.

301
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:34,518
What's a hard "p"?

302
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,854
You know, first thing
in the morning

303
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,155
When it just
won't come out?

304
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,023
Oh yeah.

305
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,192
Umm... okay,
sound is speeding and...

306
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,927
? We wish you
a merry christmas-?

307
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,494
Hold on.

308
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,230
Ahh! Ahh!

309
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,301
Ahh, hmm, okay, and...

310
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,253
? We wish you
a merry christmas?

311
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,771
? We wish
you a merry christmas-?

312
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,072
Hey,
wait a minute!

313
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,339
What?

314
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,241
Aren't you
jewish, kyle?

315
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,507
Well, yes,
i think so.

316
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,711
Dude, jewish people don't
celebrate christmas,

317
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,181
You're supposed to sing
chanukah songs.

318
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,784
? Dreidel dreidel dreidel
i made you out of clay?

319
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,103
? Dreidel dreidel dreidel-?

320
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,387
Heh-Heh-Heh,
chanukah sucks.

321
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,653
Don't you
oppress me, fat boy!

322
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,388
Don't call me fat,
butt!

323
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,375
Then don't belittle my people,
you fat-Ass!

324
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,327
Guys, knock it off,
we have to record this.

325
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,062
Dude, that was awesome.

326
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,328
What's awesome?

327
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,630
The script,
it's sweet.

328
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,400
That's not in the script,
they do this all the time.

329
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,666
Well, it should be
in the script.

330
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,870
All that, you're fat and
you're a jew and stuff.

331
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,171
It's great.

332
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:30,474
Check it out, dude.

333
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,810
The camera shoots
one frame at a time.

334
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,979
So, all we gotta do is
put the right mouth on,

335
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,148
According to what syllable
they're pronouncing at that frame.

336
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,414
Easy.

337
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,184
Yeah, so what's
the first syllable?

338
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,884
Ah, "w",wewish you
a merry christmas.

339
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,522
Okay, so we put little "woo"
mouths on all our heads.

340
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,257
And then we shoot that
for one frame.

341
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,523
Okay.

342
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,824
One.

343
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,028
That's 1/24th of a second
of our movie already shot.

344
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:50,861
Kick-Ass!

345
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,763
Now the next mouth.

346
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,932
Ah, "e",wewish you
a merry christmas.

347
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,233
Okay, where are
the "e" mouths?

348
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,968
"E" mouths...

349
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,005
Okay,
"woo" mouths again.

350
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,740
One, two.

351
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,258
So how much done
is that?

352
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,343
"We wish you a merry."

353
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:05,644
Ah, jesus christ.

354
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,680
These kids better make a good
christmas movie, johnson.

355
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,849
If people in this town
don't start shopping again

356
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,584
We're all gonna be
out of jobs next year!

357
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,718
This place is
pretty rundown.

358
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,356
It's all right, we've got
a cleanup crew coming.

359
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,891
Howww-Dy ho!

360
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,392
Down here!

361
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:21,658
Ahh!

362
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,261
Oh, mr. Hankey, it's you,
how wonderful.

363
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,200
My family and i are here to get the
drive-In ready for the big movie!

364
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,466
Perfect.

365
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,320
Hi, there, mr. Important
political person.

366
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:35,140
You want to bet me i won't
take off my clothes

367
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,875
And run naked through
this parking lot?

368
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,044
Honey, please
don't start.

369
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:39,911
I didn't start it!

370
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,646
He was looking
at my breasts.

371
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,948
They're not real,
you know.

372
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,648
Don't you say that!

373
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,852
Oh, big secret, everyone can
tell they're made of "silicorn".

374
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:50,322
Ah, we'll just leave you
to your cleanup.

375
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,588
Okay!

376
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:54,226
Boy oh boy, this place
sure needs a lot of work.

377
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:55,492
We can
fix it up, dad.

378
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,696
Oh look,
a homeless person.

379
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh, he looks sad, papa.

380
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,202
There, that's better.

381
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:05,469
Good job, amber.

382
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,540
Now this place is starting
to look christmas-Y.

383
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,179
Okay, okay, this shot
is finally set up.

384
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,348
Now shoot the "oh" mouth
for two frames.

385
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,215
A- Choo!

386
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:18,482
Ahh!

387
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,349
Cartman!

388
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,084
Well, i'm sorry,
i have a cold.

389
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,854
That took us half an hour
to set up, fat-Ass!

390
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,390
All right,
you know what?!

391
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,856
I have been here
too long!

392
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,626
I'm sick of making
this stupid cartoon

393
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,361
And we're never gonna
finish it anyways!

394
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,547
Screw you, guys...
i'm going home!

395
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,291
Fine, we'll do it
without you.

396
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:34,813
We can't do it
without him, kyle,

397
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,301
We've already
animated him in it.

398
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,403
We'll dub his voiceover.

399
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,435
Kyle, it's hopeless.

400
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,170
We've only got 20 seconds
of animation done.

401
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,940
We still have jesus' and
santa's voices to record.

402
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,206
We don't even have
a third act.

403
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,976
Dude, it would take a miracle
to finish this thing.

404
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,278
Now, don't go
saying that.

405
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,544
There's always hope.

406
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,314
Miracles happen
most everyday...

407
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,916
? To people
like you and me?

408
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,970
? But don't expect
a miracle?

409
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:57,989
? Unless you help
make it to be?

410
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,158
? You hope
and i'll hurry?

411
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,858
? You pray and i'll plan?

412
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,593
? We'll do what's
necessary?

413
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:07,098
? 'Cause even a miracle
needs a hand?

414
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,365
? You love?
? We love?

415
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,267
? And i'll labor?
? Tra la la?

416
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,586
? You sit?
? We sit?

417
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:11,835
? And i'll stand?

418
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,472
? Get help from our
next door neighbor?

419
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,658
? 'Cause even a miracle
needs a hand?

420
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,810
You can do cartman's
voice, can't you?

421
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,076
Uh, i'm so fat.

422
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,378
You gotta sound fatter.

423
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,113
Hey, you guys, seriously.

424
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,883
I'm so fat,
help me out over here.

425
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,486
Cool, now let's try the script. Rolling.

426
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,221
I don't know what to do, dude,
who should we help?

427
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:30,921
I say we help santa claus.

428
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,691
Oh, you're just saying that
because he brings you candy.

429
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:36,161
Hey, i don't need to take that
kind of from a jew!

430
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,330
? You wish?
? We wish?

431
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,631
? And i'll whittle?
? Tra la la?

432
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,733
? You sit?
? We sit?

433
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,765
? And i'll stand?

434
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,535
? Let's all try to
help a little?

435
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,404
? 'Cause even a miracle-?

436
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,475
It's okay, we'll just have
his character die in the film.

437
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,680
? Even a miracle
needs a hand...?

438
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,718
Citizens of south park,

439
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,356
The colorado film commission
is pleased to present to you

440
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:08,693
A work by some of our
very own south park children.

441
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,960
Thank you, thank you.

442
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,730
Cartman, what the hell are you
doing here, you quit?

443
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,031
What are you
talking about "quit"?

444
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,297
Puh-
I don't remember that.

445
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,935
We know that after you see this
darling short film

446
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,121
You will all feel
the mighty glow

447
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,273
Of the christmas spirit
once again.

448
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:22,539
Boys?

449
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,441
Okay, mr. Hankey.

450
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,044
Okay!

451
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,382
? We wish you
a merry christmas?

452
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,767
? We wish you a merry
christmas?

453
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,719
? We wish you
a merry christmas-?

454
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,038
Hey, wait a minute.
What?

455
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,322
Aren't you jewish, kyle?

456
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,588
Yeah, i think so.

457
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,226
Dude, jewish people don't
celebrate christmas. What?

458
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,961
You're supposed to sing
chanukah songs.

459
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,130
? Dreidel dreidel dreidel-?

460
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,674
Nnn, pretty!

461
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,444
Well, that's christmas
for ya.

462
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,911
Just hang on, folks,

463
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,782
We seem to be having some
technical difficulties.

464
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,048
Stupid.

465
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,119
It's completely destroyed,
there's nothing i can do!

466
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,386
All that hard work.

467
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,555
Well, thanks a lot, kids,
great idea you had there.

468
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,192
Now everyone is more disenfranchised
with christmas than ever.

469
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,927
We want our
300 bucks back.

470
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:16,760
But we spent it.

471
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,096
Fine,
then we'll sue you.

472
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,362
Johnson.

473
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:24,169
I... used to
believe in miracles.

474
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,687
All that work.

475
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:26,736
For nothing.

476
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,723
Boys, i-I'm...
i'm sorry.

477
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,640
Sure, sure,
mr. Hankey.

478
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,712
I guess we might as well
go home now.

479
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,435
It's my fault,
all my fault.

480
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,352
I got everyone's
hopes up.

481
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,122
But, dad, we can
fix the projector.

482
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,857
Oh, it's too late
for that, son.

483
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,123
Everyone's gone home.

484
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,327
And i don't know nothin'
about projectors.

485
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,461
I'm just a stupid
piece of crap.

486
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,231
Dad, you taught me
an important lesson,

487
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,931
That crap is the cycle
of everything.

488
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,569
Oh, that was just a
stupid song, cornwallis!

489
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,738
I was just trying to get you
to stop your bitching.

490
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,004
No, it wasn't
a stupid song,

491
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,774
Because you showed me
that i have the power

492
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,509
And the strength
to do anything i want.

493
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,111
You made me
believe in myself, dad.

494
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,280
Now i'm asking you
to do the same.

495
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,848
Son...

496
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,919
You're the smartest piece of
crap since albert poo-Dinger!

497
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,620
Come on!

498
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,125
Isn't this a nice
christmas, stanley?

499
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,094
No commercialism
and shopping,

500
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,029
Just a nice fire
and family.

501
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,499
I wanna die!

502
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:44,814
They did it!

503
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,116
They've got it
working!

504
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,319
You have blemished
the meaning of christmas

505
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,855
For the last time, kringle.

506
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,356
I bring happiness and love

507
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,490
To children
all over the world.

508
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,694
Christmas is for
celebrating my birth.

509
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,880
Christmas is for giving.

510
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,031
Oh... wow.

511
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,332
Mom, they got it
working!

512
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,803
What, son, they got your
father's penis working again?

513
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:09,140
We actually spoke tothe
brian boitano.

514
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,442
Yeah, and you know,

515
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,610
I think i learned
something today.

516
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,345
It doesn't matter
if you're christian,

517
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,479
Or jewish
or atheist or hindu-

518
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,117
Christmas is still about
one very important thing.

519
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:19,949
Yeah, ham.

520
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,118
No, not ham!

521
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:23,888
Hey, why the hell did you
have me say that?

522
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,588
We can make you say
whatever we wanted.

523
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,792
Christmas is about something
much more important.

524
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,527
What?
Presents.

525
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,997
Don't you see, kyle?
Presents.

526
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,183
Presents?
Presents.

527
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,300
My god, they're right!

528
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,035
Christmasis
about presents.

529
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,540
If we all buy presents,
everyone benefits, m'kay.

530
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,010
That is the spirit of
christmas- Commercialism.

531
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,179
Because it's what makes
our country work.

532
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,348
They're starting to
understand, johnson,

533
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,083
They're starting to
understand.

534
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,686
We got so caught up in the
little things of christmas,

535
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,820
Like love and family,
that we almost forgot

536
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,457
It's buying things that
makes our economy thrive.

537
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,643
Hey, the shops
are still open.

538
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,795
We still have
time to shop!

539
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,530
Cool, let's go!

540
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,831
Yeah, let's go!

541
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,170
Woo!

542
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,073
You did it,
mr. Hankey,

543
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,808
You brought back
the spirit of christmas.

544
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,560
No, you did it, boys.

545
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,243
Ah hell,
we all did it.

546
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,978
Kids, that cartoon
was fabulous.

547
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,314
How would you like to
have your own show

548
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,616
And make 100 more of them?

549
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:25,882
Are you kidding?

550
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,435
I think we'd rather
stab ourselves in the head.

551
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,953
Yeah, let's just go home
and open our presents.

552
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:31,556
Hey, man, if you're jewish,
you get presents for eight days.

553
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,388
Wow, count me in!

00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,690
