00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,651

Mom, seriously!

16
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,536
Something wonderful
has happened!

17
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,369
What is it, snookums?

18
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,488
Mom, look-
The tooth fairy!

19
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:39,572
I put a tooth
under my pillow

20
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,839
And she gave me $2.00!

21
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,175
She's only given me
a lousy quarter before!

22
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,875
Oh my, she must
think that

23
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,079
You are a very
special little muffin.

24
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,814
Yeah, this
isso tits!

25
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,514
Don't say
"tits", eric.

26
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,249
Oh, i mean,
this is so cool!

27
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,019
Well, perhaps now
you should take that money

28
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,320
And open up
a savings account

29
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,021
That has compounded
daily interest.

30
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,441
Heh, you can compound
daily my ass with interest, mom

31
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,827
I'm goin' to the toy store,
and buy me a skateboard.

32
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:02,527
But eric, i think maybe

33
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,863
The tooth fairy wants you
to use that money

34
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,563
To learn about saving.

35
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,116
Mom, you don't know
what the tooth fairy

36
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,635
Wants me to do
with this money, okay?

37
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,502
You're not
the tooth fairy!

38
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:10,769
I'll see you later.

39
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,937
Oh man,
this is so tits!

40
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,672
You guys, you're not
gonna believe this!

41
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,310
Oh my god, you guys! Just wait
'til you hear this, you guys!

42
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,913
I'm rich! I'm totally rich!
Aren't you stoked?

43
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,214
What the hell's
wrong with cartman?

44
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,515
He's fat
and he's stupid?

45
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,251
Look at what the tooth fairy
left me last night!

46
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,419
$2.Oo!

47
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,252
No way!

48
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,154
For one tooth?

49
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,421
For one tooth!

50
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,191
Dude, every time i lost a
tooth, i only got a quarter.

51
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,926
I only got a
jar of gefilte fish.

52
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:33,793
Well, that
doesn't matter,

53
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,464
Because i have an idea
that is totally tits!

54
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,130
Totallywhat?

55
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,300
Look, i don't know
why the tooth fairy

56
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,167
Is being
so cool to me,

57
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,819
Maybe she's hot
for me, i don't know.

58
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:44,179
But if we all
chip in with teeth,

59
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,470
Then i can hide them
undermy pillow

60
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,674
And we can get enough money
to buy asega dreamcast!

61
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,940
Sega dreamcast?

62
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,276
All we need is teeth.

63
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,011
I already lost
all my baby teeth.

64
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,547
Me too!

65
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:55,013
Uh-Uh!

66
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,349
You still have
baby teeth, kenny?

67
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,182
Mph-Mmp!

68
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,483
Kenny, think about it!

69
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,784
Don't you want
asega dreamcast?

70
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,953
No, i don't!
Thank you

71
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,157
Alright,
kenny's in, you guys!

72
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,458
Tits!

73
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,928
Okay, the string
is tied to kenny's tooth,

74
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:09,761
You ready over there?

75
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,531
Almost,
you ready, timmy?

76
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,398
Timmy!

77
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,532
When i say go,

78
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,869
You slam your electric wheelchair
into high gear, okay, timmy?

79
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,701
Timmy!

80
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,820
Right, you're timmy.

81
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,905
Timmy!
Gimme a-Yah!

82
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,605
Mphh-Mphh...

83
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,941
I'll tell you why
it has to be you, kenny.

84
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,208
Because your
family is poor,

85
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,943
And therefore
has bad oral hygene

86
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,713
So your teeth are gonna
fall out someday, anyway.

87
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:27,545
If you think about it,

88
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,664
You should actually
be thanking us.

89
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,749
Oh, thank you, guys!

90
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,050
You're welcome, kenny!

91
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,317
F- Phk-Ymph!

92
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,219
Alright,
get ready, timmy.

93
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,052
Timmy!

94
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,171
Hey, guys,
what are you doin'?

95
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,256
What does it
look like, butters?

96
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,522
We need a tooth,

97
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,424
So we're using
timmy's wheelchair

98
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,292
To pull out
one of kenny's.

99
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,461
Oh, hey, i got
a loose tooth right here.

100
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,328
You what?
You what?

101
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,213
You what!

102
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,063
Timmy!

103
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,798
Yep, one of mine came out
not two hours ago.

104
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,100
Uh, butters,
could we have it?

105
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,366
Well, heck no,
you can't have it!

106
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,521
Why i'm gonna
stick it under my pillow

107
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:54,641
And get money
from the tooth fairy,

108
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,558
She always gives
me 50¢ a tooth!

109
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,334
Well, i'll
see you, fellas!

110
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,076
Dude, maybe
we don't have to

111
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,343
Rip a tooth
out of kenny's mouth.

112
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,679
Yeah, we just have
to get butters' tooth.

113
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:00,512
Whoo-Hoo!

114
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,414
How we gonna
get it from 'im?

115
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,715
I guess we'll have to
sneak into his house

116
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,017
After he goes
to sleep tonight.

117
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:05,552
Yeah, let's go!

118
00:03:05,587 --> 00:03:07,053
Go, timmy, go!

119
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,872
No, timmy, wait!

120
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:10,957
Thing won't gimme!

121
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,258
Oh!

122
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:18,765
Hey, you guys, i can see
kenny's little ping-A-Ling!

123
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:20,500
Wa-Aaa!

124
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,610
Higher, you guys!

125
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,814
Christ, why did we pick
the fat guy to lift up?

126
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,217
Ow! Careful,
you assholes!

127
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:39,503
To the left,
you guys, left!

128
00:03:39,538 --> 00:03:41,754
No, camera left!
Camera left!

129
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,888
That's it, now down!

130
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,491
What the- Who's there?
Who is that?

131
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,562
I am the tooth fairy, my child.

132
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,599
Oh, sorry, miss fairy,
i didn't mean to gaze at you,

133
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,299
I'm back
asleep now, see?

134
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:59,105
Yes! Now i will leave you
tidings under your pillow!

135
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,744
Oh, gosh, i didn't
think you'd be so fat.

136
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:05,577
Hey!

137
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,878
Come on, fat ass!

138
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,515
Do not open your eyes
until morning

139
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,118
Or else i will
kick you in the nuts...

140
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,853
Ahh, in the nuts.

141
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,154
Yes, ma'am!

142
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,456
Well?

143
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,191
Bullseye!

144
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,926
? Tucky-Tucky time?

145
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,095
? It's the best time
of the night?

146
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,795
I love that song, mom.
Sing it again!

147
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,999
No, honey, mommy's
got to save her throat.

148
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,300
I have to
work tonight!

149
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,132
Okay.

150
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,035
Goodnight!

151
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,204
What do you
have there, eric?

152
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,904
Another tooth
fell out today.

153
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,205
I'm leavin' it
for the tooth fairy.

154
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,940
Oh my, the tooth fairy
will have to give you

155
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:39,445
A big surprise for losing
two teeth in two days!

156
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,712
I know, huh?

157
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,915
You guys!
Oh my god, you guys

158
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,433
You're not
gonna believe it!

159
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:45,518
It's beyond
rational thought!

160
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,784
Holy crap, you guys!

161
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,687
Did the
tooth fairy come?

162
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,953
$4.Oo!

163
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:49,821
Oh my god!
Oh my god!

164
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,122
Do you guys know
what this means?

165
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,675
Yeah, we just gotta
keep finding teeth

166
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,193
And putting them
under your pillow.

167
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,629
Dentist office.

168
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,231
Oh hello, dr. Roberts?
It's miss cartman.

169
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,001
Oh, yes, miss cartman,
what can i do for you?

170
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,268
Well, it's my son,

171
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,254
He's lost a lot
of his baby teeth

172
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,171
And i was starting
to get worried.

173
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,243
Well, losing baby teeth is a
natural thing, miss cartman.

174
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:11,544
How many has he lost?

175
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,147
About 112.

176
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,281
112?

177
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,449
Yes, 15 of them
in one night.

178
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,219
Perhaps he should
switch toothpaste?

179
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,557
Your son wouldn't happen to be
an alligator, would he, no?

180
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,257
Hmmm, i see.

181
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,027
Well, i'm afraid i can't
help you right now.

182
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,630
The american dental association
convention is this week,

183
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,232
But as soon as i get back,
i'll look into it.

184
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,401
Oh, thank you.
Freebie next week!

185
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,703
What?

186
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,704
Daa-

187
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,908
Tooth?
What the hell?

188
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:42,740
Mom!

189
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,042
Yes, eric.

190
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,378
The stuipid tooth fairy forgot
to bring me money last night.

191
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,644
Call the police!

192
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,945
Oh, eric-Poopy,
sit down,

193
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,716
Mommy has something
to tell you.

194
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,283
It's just
that... well

195
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,886
There is no
tooth fairy, eric.

196
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,873
I've been putting all that
money under your pillow

197
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,825
And because you've had
so many teeth fall out,

198
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,091
I've actually
run out of money

199
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,596
And can't go to the grocery
store for at least a month.

200
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,066
You almost had me
for a second there, mom.

201
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,368
"There's no tooth fairy"

202
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,669
I suppose next
you're gonna tell me

203
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,271
There's no santa claus,
easter bunny, or jesus either.

204
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,477
Mom?

205
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,947
I'm sorry, eric, all children
find out sooner or later.

206
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,213
You're serious?

207
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,549
There really is
no tooth fairy?

208
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,249
No honey,
it's just-

209
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,586
How could you lie
to me, mother?

210
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,286
Lie right to my face?

211
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,923
Oh eric, it's just
part of being a child.

212
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:31,791
How can i trust you?

213
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,960
How can i ever trust
anyone ever again, mother?

214
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,996
I guess... to
make it in this life,

215
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,297
I can only trust myself.

216
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,768
Myself, and willikins bear, of course.

217
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:43,034
Eric, eric, wait!

218
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,238
No, mother!
No more lies!

219
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,443
Dude, where's
the money?

220
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,527
There is no money.

221
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,178
No more money?

222
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,444
What are you
talking about, cartman?

223
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,214
We're only $167 away
from getting a sega.

224
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,047
I know!

225
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,817
Cartman,
what's going on?

226
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,517
You guys...

227
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,588
Oh, god,i don't even
know how to tell you this...

228
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,855
Tell us what?

229
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,625
You guys, there's no
tooth fairy, you guys.

230
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,325
There, i said it.

231
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,060
What do you mean,
there's no tooth fairy?

232
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,830
My mom's been giving us
the money all this time,

233
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,565
Your parents are the
ones that left you money.

234
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,433
Dude!

235
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,699
That can't be!

236
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,566
My parents
wouldn't lie to me.

237
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,868
But now my mom has
given me so much money

238
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,071
That she's bankrupt and
we're poor, like kenny.

239
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,373
Don't touch me, kenny.

240
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,240
You're wrong!

241
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,542
If my dad says that
something is real,

242
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:23,374
Then it's real!

243
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,144
Kyle, open your
eyes, man!

244
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,879
It's not true!

245
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,748
Oh, hello, son.

246
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,084
Dad, there is so
a tooth fairy, huh?

247
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,917
What? Oh!

248
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,121
Kyle, let's
have a little talk.

249
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,255
Oh my god,
youdidlie to me!

250
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,025
No, kyle, she's
just make-Believe.

251
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,326
Like peter pan.

252
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,061
Peter pan too!?

253
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,327
Kyle!

254
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,663
What about moses,
and abraham?

255
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,965
Well, they were
probably real.

256
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,798
Probably?

257
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,700
Is atlantis real?

258
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:48,568
Probably not.

259
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,834
Aahhh!

260
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,953
But kyle, adults
make up those things

261
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,038
Because they're
fun for children!

262
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,356
Fun for children?

263
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,605
Look at me, dad!

264
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,142
I don't even know
what's real anymore!

265
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:56,809
Aaahh!

266
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,448
Man, i can't believe
all our parents

267
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,148
Lied to us about
the tooth fairy.

268
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,352
What about dan rather,
do you think he's real?

269
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,052
Naw man, that's
just a tv show.

270
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,822
You guys, you guys!
I've figured it out!

271
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,557
What? That your
parents lied to you too?

272
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,390
Yeah, but it's okay,

273
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,726
We can still get
oursega dreamcast.

274
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,992
How?

275
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,329
Look, the tooth fairy
is all made up, right?

276
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,498
All made up, not
real, nothing's real.

277
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,365
So all we have to do,

278
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,100
Is go to a really
rich kid's house

279
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,401
Put our tooth
under his pillow

280
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,570
Wait for his parents to leave
him a whole butt-Load of money

281
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,305
Then sneak back in
and take it!

282
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,173
Woo-Hoo!

283
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,474
The kid'll
never even know.

284
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,174
Oh dude, that istits!

285
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,378
That is big fat
oprah tits, right there!

286
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:34,113
Oh my god,
what if i'm not real?

287
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,414
We can take the
bus to the city

288
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,716
There's super-Rich
people down there.

289
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,982
Yeah!

290
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,318
I mean, what if i'm just
part of my parent's reality?

291
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,585
C'mon, kyle!

292
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,222
What if this is all
just somebody's dream?

293
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
Wow! Look at the
size of these houses!

294
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:51,898
Told you, dude,

295
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,632
Cherry creek is the
richest part of denver.

296
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,934
I'll bet these kids
get 10 bucks a tooth

297
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,200
From the "tooth fairy".

298
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,502
Hey, that house
looks perfect!

299
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,404
There's obviously
kids living there.

300
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,007
Here, you can tell
this is the kids's window

301
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,325
'Cuz it's gotmegaman
stickers on it.

302
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,574
Cartman,once you're
in the kid's room,

303
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,911
Leave the tooth under the
pillow, then come back out.

304
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,646
We'll wait for the parents
to see it and leave money,

305
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:07,947
Then swing you
back in to grab it.

306
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:08,814
Got it.

307
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,285
This is the smartest
business venture, ever!

308
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,286
What the-?

309
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,322
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

310
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,526
We're gonna sneak a tooth under
this rich kid's pillow

311
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,261
Then come back and
take the tooth fairy money

312
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,013
That his parents leave him.

313
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,731
Hey, you can't
do that!

314
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,599
Why not?

315
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:27,900
Because that's what
we're going to do!

316
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,166
Yeah, you ripped off
our idea.

317
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,502
What the hell are
you talking about?

318
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,804
We've been doing this
for over 2 years.

319
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,070
2 years?

320
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,372
Nice tooth fairy costume!

321
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,142
You think anybody'd
believe you in that?

322
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,408
It's better than
your dress!

323
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,178
You look like a bad
jennifer lopez nightmare.

324
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,046
How dare you!

325
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,481
Look, this is our turf,

326
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,251
You better scram before
the boss breaks your legs.

327
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,986
You scram,
we were here first!

328
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:47,853
What's going on?

329
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,554
Oh, it's the
tooth fairies!

330
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,324
Oh, nice going!
Now you woke him up.

331
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,590
Youwoke him up!

332
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,492
I don't have any
loose teeth, miss fairies.

333
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,594
But i have been
a very good boy.

334
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,579
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

335
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:56,529
Alright,
that does it!

336
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,264
C'mon we're going
to see the boss!

337
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,131
Who's the boss?

338
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,866
Loogie.

339
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,770
My associates here tell me you
were working cherry creek tonight.

340
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,288
Is that true?

341
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,338
Uh, yeah.

342
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,639
Right on
our turf, boss,

343
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,976
I ain't never seen
that kinda disre-

344
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,277
We were there first!

345
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,879
Kids been doing the tooth fairy
racket in this town for years

346
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,615
I do it just like
my big brother before me,

347
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,315
And my oldest brother
before that.

348
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,518
Damn it! And we thought
we were so original!

349
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,785
Let me ask you something,

350
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,121
You were gonna sneak a tooth
under this rich kid's pillow?

351
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,422
Then what?

352
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,724
What do you mean?

353
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,424
How were the kid's parents
going to know

354
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,628
There was a tooth
under their child's pillow?

355
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,597
Ha! You guys
don't even know

356
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,232
How the
tooth trade works!

357
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,798
What's the
tooth trade?

358
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,002
Look, any shmuck can
sneak through a window

359
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:36,834
Wearing a pretty dress.

360
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,003
The tooth racket
is much more involved.

361
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,738
We keep careful track
of what houses we've hit

362
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,376
So we don't hit the same ones
twice in less than 2 months.

363
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,544
We not only have to
sneak a tooth under the pillow

364
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,147
But leave a note for
mom and dad to see.

365
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,333
This is how we let
the parents know

366
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:52,450
To leave money
under the pillow.

367
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,437
Once the notes have been
placed in the last house,

368
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:56,948
We start all over,
going back to the first house.

369
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:59,425
But this time, all we
have to do is collect money.

370
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,028
And the kids never
know what hit 'em.

371
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,294
Wow!
Wow! Wow!

372
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,064
The hardest part
is getting teeth.

373
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,799
We've tried
various places...

374
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,551
Cemetaries...

375
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,269
Hockey games...

376
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,872
Anywhere we can
find them.

377
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,138
No!

378
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,474
The teeth we do
manage to acquire

379
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,643
Are then sorted according to
size, color and quality.

380
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,812
But there's
never enough teeth...

381
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,131
Never enough.

382
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,415
Amazing!

383
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,548
Man, that is tits!

384
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,535
And now my
only problem is:

385
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,487
What do i
do with you?

386
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,187
Raarr!

387
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,957
Tell you what,
how would you like to

388
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,693
Run the south park
tooth racket for me?

389
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:34,959
Oh, i don't know.

390
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,163
It's that or i can
cut off you penises.

391
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,633
Hmmm, work for you,
or have my penis cut off.

392
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,235
Work for you,
or have my...?

393
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,502
Cartman!

394
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,272
How much do we get
if we work for you?

395
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,538
I'll cut you
in at 2%

396
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,609
2% or have my
penis cut off...?

397
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,778
We're in!

398
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,381
Fellow dentists,
as you all know

399
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,081
We are still
having numerous reports

400
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,285
Of missing teeth
from all over the country

401
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,286
There are also reports of
missing tooth fairy money.

402
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:08,394
We believe that there can be only
one logical reason for all of this.

403
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,697
A giant half-Chicken,
half-Squirrel

404
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,768
That steals either teeth or
money from children as they sleep

405
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,902
In order to build
some kind of a giant nest

406
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,407
For its genetically superior and
potentially dangerous offspring.

407
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,107
We believe also,

408
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,311
That this creature would have
at least a mild understanding

409
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,612
Of algebra.

410
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,516
Uh, excuse me, i think
i have a more logical theory.

411
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,554
Well, by all means,
mr. Foley, enlighten us.

412
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,191
I think what we've got here
is a black market tooth racket.

413
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,794
Something where one group
is stealing the money and teeth

414
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,529
From another group
for a profit.

415
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,264
Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

416
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,999
Ha ha!
Ha ha! Ha ha!

417
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,337
Oh, mr. Foley, you realize
how ridiculous that sounds.

418
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,506
It's not ridiculous,
it's very possible!

419
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,807
I've seen it
happen before.

420
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,639
Where?

421
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,542
In montreal.

422
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,494
Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

423
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,977
Ha ha!
Ha ha! Ha ha!

424
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,682
And where, pray,
is this mon-Tree-Al?

425
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,749
Look, i know
how to handle this.

426
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,519
All we have to do is
bring down the kingpin

427
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:08,219
And the rest will fall.

428
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,856
You'll see, i'll have it taken
care of in a matter of weeks.

429
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,194
Very well, mr. Foley, you go
on your wild goose chase!

430
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,098
And meanwhile, we'll deal with
therealproblems at hand.

431
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,798
I will!

432
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,086
Anyway, the half-Chicken
half-Squirrel

433
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,339
Would most likely be
3 to 4½ feet tall

434
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,942
His large beak
is probably detachable

435
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,677
And works as
a flotation device.

436
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,389
Hello there,
children!

437
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,655
Hey, chef!
Hey, chefhey, chef!

438
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,390
We all want double
desserts today!

439
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,461
Oh, well, i'm afraid that the
school charges extra for that.

440
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,197
Oh yeah well, that
ain't nothin' but athang.

441
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:52,498
Oh my god!

442
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,667
There's got to be
at least $15 here.

443
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,052
That's right, keep
the change, my man.

444
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,004
Well, look at you
cute little crackers

445
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,342
With your money, and your fancy
clothes and your cellphones

446
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,094
It's almost
like you were-

447
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,777
Oh my god!
Children!

448
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,113
What have i
old you about drugs?

449
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,282
That there's a time
and a place for everything

450
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,584
And it's calledcollege.

451
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:12,850
That's right!

452
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,487
And the only thing worse than
doin' drugs, is dealin' drugs.

453
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,656
I'm gonna tell you about
when i was your age

454
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,259
And got offered drugs.

455
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:22,827
Oh, c'mon now.

456
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,163
Hey kid, you wanna
try some dope?

457
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,429
What?

458
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,765
C'mon,kid, don't you
wanna get high?

459
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,717
Hey man, i don't
need dope.

460
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,236
Let me sing you
a little song.

461
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,369
? I can't wait
until i grow up?

462
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,104
? And my wienie gets
big and strong?

463
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,308
? 'Cuz when it does,
i'm gonna find you?

464
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,442
? And make love to ya'
amanda, all night long?

465
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,513
? I'm gonna make love to
ya' amanda in about 10 years?

466
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,346
What?

467
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,647
What the hell is
he talkin' about?

468
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,417
And this toothpick
is gonna turn into an oak tree.

469
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,684
I'm gonna knock down

470
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,586
Uh, chef!
Knock you over

471
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,321
Chef! Knock you all around.

472
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,588
Chef!
Huh?

473
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,924
We're not
dealing drugs.

474
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:52,791
You're not?

475
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,624
No.

476
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,925
Oh, uh...
well, children,

477
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,695
Whatever you're doing,
just remember this:

478
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,732
Having money
may seem fun but...

479
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,901
Oh, never mind.

480
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,852
Thanks, chef.
Thanks, thanks, chef.

481
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,371
Damn,that little
amanda was fine.

482
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:07,539
I gotta look her up.

483
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,708
Dude, having this
much money is great!

484
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,576
Working for loogierules.

485
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,178
Yeah, but you know...
why do we need loogie?

486
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,879
We know how the trade works

487
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,649
Why don't we do it ourselves
and keep all the profits?

488
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,384
We can't do that, dude,
loogie will kick our asses.

489
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,552
Oh, what the hell is that
little pollock gonna do?

490
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,023
C'mon you guys, i say we
create our own mob crime family.

491
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:26,156
Dude, this book says
there could be

492
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,927
Infinite alternate realities
to every reality.

493
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,662
Sure, kyle.

494
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,915
They're what?
They're not gonna pay me?

495
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,559
Who the hell do they
think they are?

496
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:36,168
I want those
south park kids dead.

497
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,868
I want their
families dead.

498
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,638
I want their houses
burnt to the ground.

499
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, hi there mister.

500
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,675
My mommy and daddy
are out front if you need 'em.

501
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,375
Let's cut the crap, kid.

502
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,880
My name is tom foley, i'm with
the american dental association.

503
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:51,350
Sit down, mr. Foley,
you want some spaghetti?

504
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,484
No, thanks,
i just brushed.

505
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,555
I just wanted to let you
know that i'm on to you.

506
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,290
I told the a.D.A.
A thousand times,

507
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,025
I know nothing
about teeth.

508
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,194
I'm just an 8 year old boy who likes
climbing trees and playing in puddles.

509
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,363
I am going to find out
who the boss is,

510
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,098
And when i do
i'm gonna bust his ass

511
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,002
And everyone's ass
who helped hide his ass.

512
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,942
So, you brought me 400 ibs.
Of teeth from china?

513
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,076
That's right, yeah,
it's all top grade stuff, too.

514
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,846
These chinese kids are selling
their teeth for peanuts, see?

515
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:22,112
How much?

516
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,414
Well, tang lee wants 30,

517
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,750
But i can cut you
a deal for 28, yeah?

518
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,119
What do you say, huh?

519
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:28,654
Can i ask you
a question, weasel?

520
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:29,920
Well, why, sure, sure!

521
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,655
Do you think
i'm an idiot?

522
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,258
These are cat teeth,
you son-Of-A-Bitch!

523
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,028
You're trying to sell me
400 ibs. Of cat teeth!

524
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,980
Get outta my sight!

525
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:39,407
You lousy little scum!

526
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,764
What!

527
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,883
This is your
last chance, kid.

528
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,968
Either you give
the boss his cut,

529
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,703
Or else we're gonna throw
your pal into the river

530
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,005
Wearing concrete galoshes.

531
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,607
I ain't givin' you crap,
kenny's not afraid of you!

532
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,307
Oh, my god!

533
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,511
This book says that negative and
positive are the same thing.

534
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,246
That "real" and
"not real" are one!

535
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,114
He's not gonna do it?

536
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,380
Mprh mprmm mprh!

537
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,716
He's not gonna
do it, boss.

538
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,468
Well, then,
throw him in.

539
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,186
Alright, kid,
time to die.

540
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:07,224
No! No! No!

541
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,260
Aw, man, how deep
is the platt river?

542
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,898
...to which ms. Clinton replied,
"i don't even like vagina."

543
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:15,067
Finally, tonight
a human interest story.

544
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,333
Dan akawa is live.

545
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,187
Thanks, tom, i'm at the house
of little billy circlovich

546
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:22,007
Billy is in desperate need
of a bone marrow transplant,

547
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,575
Or he will
most certainly die.

548
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,345
Billy, how much more money do
you need for the transplant?

549
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,045
600-

550
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,815
Louder, billy,
we can't hear ya!

551
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,647
Just $600.

552
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,550
Well, that's
a lot of money.

553
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,285
How the hell are you
gonna get all that

554
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,586
In the short amount
of time you have left?

555
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,888
Well, i don't know.

556
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,490
Well, billy, i also understand
that you lost a tooth today.

557
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,659
Billy we want you to put that
tooth under your pillow tonight.

558
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,828
Because we have a feeling
that the tooth fairy

559
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:46,298
Is going to leave you
$600 for it.

560
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,833
Really? Really?

561
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,299
Yes, really, $600!

562
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,503
I might also mention that billy
lives in crestview apartments

563
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,973
Just of arapaho road, on
emporia street, back to you, tom.

564
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,240
How was that?

565
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,409
Perfect!
The trap is set.

566
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,612
Now, c'mon, you
really think anyone

567
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,781
Would fall for
something that stupid?

568
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,048
$600, you guys!

569
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,468
C'mon, get your stuff together,
this is gonna be tits!

570
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,854
Dude,this book says i don't
exist unless i think i do.

571
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,120
But what if i don't?

572
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,890
Will somebody take
those books away from him?

573
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,529
Be sure to put your loose tooth
under your pillow, billy.

574
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,264
Okay, mom.

575
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,903
Thank you for
helping, gentlemen.

576
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,170
If this sting
operation works,

577
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,940
Some bogus tooth fairy
should be showing up

578
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,206
To take the
sick kid's money.

579
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,410
When they touch the kid's pillow
an alarm will sound

580
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,711
And that's when you
hit the button, murphy,

581
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:33,579
And activate the lights.

582
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:34,446
Everybody got it?

583
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,146
Got it!
Got it!

584
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,784
Duh, which button
do i hit again, boss?

585
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,386
Just kidding, you know how
there's always the dumb guy

586
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,989
In sting operations
in the movies,

587
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,158
You know, i was
just acting... oh.

588
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,858
Hurry up you guys,

589
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,194
We gotta get that
sick kid's money

590
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,461
Before luggie does.

591
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,328
I can't deal
with it stan,

592
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,664
All the stuff
i've been reading,

593
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:53,966
I really don't
think i exist.

594
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,701
Dude, just stop
thinking about it.

595
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,967
But i can't!

596
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,303
What if thinking about it
is the only thing

597
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,605
Keeping my
space-Time together?

598
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,641
Sometimes i can
see time slowing down,

599
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,942
My own existence fading.

600
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,377
Goodnight mom,
goodnight dad.

601
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,714
Alright, everyone
keep your eyes peeled.

602
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,900
I'm going
to bed now, mommy.

603
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:12,860
I put my tooth
under the pillow.

604
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,751
Do you really think
the tooth fairy

605
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,088
Will give me the money
for the transplant?

606
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,389
I think so, billy,
i think so.

607
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,089
I can't wait to feel
healthy and strong again.

608
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,293
Well, you're gonna have to wait
a little bit longer, billy

609
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,427
'Cuz that 600 bucks ismine.

610
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,414
"Light is a wave,
unless it is observed."

611
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,366
That means all matter
is just a wave.

612
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:29,769
Nothing's real!
Reality-

613
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,137
Oh god!
It's happening!

614
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,740
Kyle?

615
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,475
Something strange is
happening with the computers!

616
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,945
Well, well well,
what do we have here?

617
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,645
Aw, sh-T!

618
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,380
Did you bastards
really think

619
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,681
That you could
hide from me forever?

620
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,885
Klauski, put this butt-Wipe
out of his misery!

621
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,187
I got it!

622
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,488
The tooth fairy!

623
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,090
Let's move out!

624
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,357
Holy crap!

625
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,127
Give it up, kids, you're
surrounded by dentists.

626
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,445
It was a trap!

627
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,694
That's right!

628
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,429
And now it's all exposed,
you're through!

629
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,501
The only thing left to do is
haul you kids down to prison.

630
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,767
This is reality.

631
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,405
I am everywhere
and nowhere.

632
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,706
What the hell?

633
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,972
Kyle?

634
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,044
I am nothing,
and everything.

635
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,755
Grrrrrr!

636
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,490
Ah-Ha, i told you!

637
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,563
Let's get out of here!

638
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,468
Huh, that was
pretty wierd.

639
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,974
Jesus, the little sick kid
was a set-Up all along.

640
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,275
How could i
be so stupid?

641
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,010
I can't believe i fell
for such an obvious trap,

642
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,144
What the hell's
wrong with me?

643
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,131
Well, don't take it
too hard, dude,

644
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,083
That's what
grown-Ups do, they lie.

645
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,783
Lie right to your face.

646
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,987
Oh well, maybe it's good
my empire has fallen.

647
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,253
Really?

648
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,457
Yeah, i kinda wanted to play on the
flag football team this year, anyway.

649
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,758
So,you're not gonna
hurt us or nothin'?

650
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,361
Naw, in a way i'm just glad
the whole thing's over with.

651
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,494
Yeah, but you know,
i've learned something today.

652
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,000
The basis of all reasoning is
the mind's awareness of itself.

653
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,186
What we think, the external
objects we perceive,

654
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,302
Are all like actors
that come on and off stage.

655
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,542
But our consciousness, the stage
itself, is always present to us.

656
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,579
Tits!

657
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,414
Timmy!
