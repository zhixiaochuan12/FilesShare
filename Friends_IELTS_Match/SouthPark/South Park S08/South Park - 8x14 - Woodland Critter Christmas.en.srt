00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:06,454
WilLoW :--) January 27th, 2005

2
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,760
Way up in the mountains in a small little town,

3
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,786
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.

4
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:44,361
People stood in long lines, 
sometimes waiting hours or more,

5
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,984
Because Christmas need to be bought in a store.

6
00:00:48,705 --> 00:00:50,539
But out in the forest, not too far away...

7
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:54,704
...The little woodland critters were also
preparing for their Christmas day.

8
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,994
It's almost time when the time is here,

9
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:58,552
The time that's only once a year.

10
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,989
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.

11
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:02,085
A Woodland Critter Christmas!

12
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,178
The little critters worked
 hard as they happily sang

13
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,984
And each one of them had 
a quite interesting name

14
00:01:08,452 --> 00:01:11,058
There was Squirrely the squirrel,
 Rabbity the rabbit,

15
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:13,523
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear

16
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,487
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,

17
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:19,745
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer

18
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,624
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,

19
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,850
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, 
all made the forest their house.

20
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:30,773
And on that magical day,
 stumbling upon all of that,

21
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:35,868
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.

22
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:37,432
What the hell?

23
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,863
Christmastime is once a year

24
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:46,040
Every critter holds it dear

25
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:50,188
Every animal big or small

26
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:55,213
Christmas means so much to us all

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,714
Well hello there. Welcome to our forest.

28
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,129
How do you like our Christmas tree?

29
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,739
It's... nice.

30
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,346
Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest!

31
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,042
Oh no, I see a problem.

32
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,034
What is it, Mousey?

33
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,614
Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,726
Ohhhh

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,488
We can't have a tree with no star on it.

36
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,054
What are we gonna do?

37
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:22,615
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our
new friend can help us find a star.

38
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,989
Can you really? Oh would you please?
 Could you help us?

39
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,088
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,270
Yay!!

41
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,822
And so, using some paper and working with glee,

42
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,509
the boy in the red poofball hat
 made a star for the tree

43
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,384
Ohhhh

44
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,222
It's the nicest star I ever saw.

45
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,787
The little critters cheered 
and Beavery said with a smile

46
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,097
How would you like to sing 
and dance with us for a while?

47
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:52,213
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said

48
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:54,483
Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home.

49
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,441
Goo, goodbye Stanny!

50
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,060
Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!

51
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:01,273
Wugh.

52
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:13,355
Hi, Stanny!

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,201
Oh, whatta?

54
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,554
His friends were all there!
 What a wonderful surprise!

55
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:21,557
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,801
What time is it!

57
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,323
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny.
It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!

58
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,996
Porcupiney is pregnant!

59
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,305
You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.

60
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,547
I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand
the seriousness of the fertilization.

61
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:37,180
Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny.
 Her conception was immaculate.

62
00:03:37,622 --> 00:03:39,717
She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.

63
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:41,470
...What?

64
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,662
It has been foretold unto me that
 I would give birth on Christmas Day.

65
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,504
So soon!

66
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:46,512
How delightful!

67
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,618
Our souls are saved!

68
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,917
Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own,
of their very own!

69
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:56,567
There's just one problem: We don't have
a manger for our Savior to be born in.

70
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:58,272
Awwww.

71
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,998
But we got to have a manger.

72
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,091
Can you do it, Stan. 
Can you build us a manger? Huh?

73
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,511
"Of course I'll build you a little manger!"
 the little boy cried,

74
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,604
and he winked at his critter 
friends and leapt to their side!

75
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,512
And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,

76
00:04:19,057 --> 00:04:21,918
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head

77
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:25,507
Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.

78
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:29,718
I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable
 resting place, for the Son of our Lord.

79
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:32,271
Does this mean we can go to sleep now?

80
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:35,341
My Son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.

81
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:36,793
Fit for a king!

82
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,278
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!

83
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,045
It's almost time when the time is here,

84
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:42,646
The time that's only once a year.

85
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,312
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near-

86
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,321
All right, I'm going now

87
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,753
The mountain lion! Hide!

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,892
Go away! Shoo!

89
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,386
Is it gone?

90
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,963
I deduce it is.

91
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,735
I'm not c-c-comin' out.

92
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:10,639
Well, this is the end. The mountain lion
obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant,

93
00:05:10,964 --> 00:05:12,050
and he's gonna kill it again.

94
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:13,223
Again?

95
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:17,978
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the
virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.

96
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:19,998
Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.

97
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:24,360
Let's face it. The mountain lion will 
never let our Savior be born.

98
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,175
Awwww.

99
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:30,015
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas.
 We've got Stanny!

100
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:34,318
Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger,
he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!

101
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,061
Christmas is saved!

102
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,092
High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,

103
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,308
the horrid mountain lion lived 
and preyed on the weak.

104
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,324
For the critters to be saved,
someone had to stop that nasty old cat...

105
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,215
Goddamnit, this is fucking ridiculous!

106
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:53,955
Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.

107
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,616
Killing the mountain lion was no easy task,

108
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,711
but he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.

109
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,415
Grrr. Grrr! Come on out!

110
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:12,839
Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering
innocent little animals are over!

111
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:13,935
Rawrrrrr!

112
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:19,605
Rawrrrrr!

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,394
In a flash it was over! A victorious blow!

114
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,189
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.

115
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,156
Hokay, there.

116
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,266
Mommy? Mommy!

117
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,953
W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!

118
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,719
Don't leave us, Mommy.

119
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:03,353
Man-boy, why?
 Why did you kill our mommy? Why?

120
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:10,673
I... the... critters. 
Their... bir-birth of a Savior?

121
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,311
The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,

122
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,614
All alone in the world because their mother had died.

123
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,707
Aw. Awww!

124
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:28,591
Oooo.

125
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,634
You all right, Lady Porcupiney?

126
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,607
Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.

127
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:37,224
Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid
our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.

128
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,495
Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.

129
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:43,412
I guess that means our Savior
 is gonna be made into Savior stew.

130
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:44,992
Awwww.

131
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:47,035
Wait a minute, look!

132
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:50,618
Stanny!

133
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,470
Stanny, you're alive.

134
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,602
But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,261
It's dead.

136
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,089
For real and for true?

137
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,025
Are you sure?

138
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,124
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.

139
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:08,488
He did it! Now our critter Christmas
 can finally happen! Hail Satan!

140
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,929
Hail Satan!

141
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,431
Wait, wha-what?

142
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:13,709
You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! 

143
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,053
Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney
 can give birth to the Antichrist!

144
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,220
Yaaay Satan!

145
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,955
Waiwait, the Antichrist?? You said she
was giving birth to your savior!

146
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,278
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan,
 Prince of Darkness.

147
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,810
But I thought you meant the Son of God!

148
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,741
Well, think about it: You really think
God would have sex with a porcupine?

149
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,072
No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness
and King of all Evil would do that!

150
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:32,986
Yay!

151
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:36,438
This just calls for a celebration! Let's
sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!

152
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,160
Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!

153
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,043
Drink his blood! Drink his blood!

154
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:56,630
Blood orgy!!!

155
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,762
Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!

156
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:06,922
What special time and special day,

157
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,453
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

158
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:10,182
Hail Satan.

159
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,722
In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,

160
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:17,636
The little forest critters prepared
 for the Antichrist to be born.

161
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,448
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil 
in all the years past,

162
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:26,438
But now the good protector lay
 dead as the good owls amassed.

163
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,856
And meanwhile three lion cubs were crying away.

164
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,810
For them there would certainly be no Christmas Day,

165
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:36,829
And soon the forest would suffer from
 the offspring Satan begat.

166
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:41,603
All of this because of the little boy in 
the red poofball hat.

167
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:42,735
Ugh.

168
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,324
Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,

169
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,911
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.

170
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,232
Uuugh!

171
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:51,873
"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,

172
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:55,694
"I'll go back to the forest 
and speak with those critters again!"

173
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,213
No nonono.

174
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,479
He ran out the living room,
 turned out the light,

175
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,153
and went back to the forest
 to set everything right!

176
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:12,998
... and went back to the forest
 to set everything right!

177
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:19,189
... He tried to forget all about it by watching TV

178
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,362
but his conscience caught up with him 
and to the forest he did flee.

179
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,637
... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!

180
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,789
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!

181
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:31,588
Leave me aLONE!!

182
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:34,226
He knew that only by going to the forest could he-

183
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,231
All right all right all right!! God!!

184
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:42,808
Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny.

185
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,407
Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!

186
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,715
Yeah. We've got a big problem.

187
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,470
The Great Satan has commanded
 that when the Antichrist is born,

188
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,888
we must find a human host
 body to transfer it into.

189
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,200
That way he could take over the whole world.
 The whole world!

190
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,675
The human must be non-baptized 
and heathenistic against Christ.

191
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:02,006
We figured you'd be perfect!

192
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,142
Yay!

193
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:06,091
I'm not a heathen!
 I was baptized and my family's Christian!

194
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:07,860
Awwwww.

195
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,352
But we got to have a human 
host body for the Antichrist.

196
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,862
Oh dear, maybe we won't have 
a critters C-Christmas after all.

197
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:19,273
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help
us find non-baptized heathen human.

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,686
Will you really, Stanny?

199
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:24,267
No!! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm
not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!

200
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,091
I came here to put a stop to all this!

201
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,777
To stop us?

202
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,713
But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd
have to use our evil satanic powers on ya.

203
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:35,208
Right, whatever.

204
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,837
I'm taking down the manger I built.

205
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,427
Ah!

206
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,178
Aaaah!!

207
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,018
Aagh! Aaaahh!

208
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,111
AAAAAAAH!! AAAAAAAH!!

209
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,447
Oh boy! Our satanic powers sure did the trick!

210
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,134
Our powers get stronger every day, 
get stronger every day!

211
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:00,108
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can
stop the birth of the Antichrist,

212
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,416
except for a mountain lion.

213
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:02,769
And you got rid o'her.

214
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:03,838
Yay!

215
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:07,368
The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill

216
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:11,872
When he remembered there were
 three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!

217
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,620
Oh yeah.

218
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:21,565
Hello? Anybody in there?

219
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!

220
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:26,817
He's come to kill us now.

221
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,915
It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.

222
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:33,909
Yeah, better this than the slow death
we'd face without a mother around.

223
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,622
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The,
the squirrel told me she was evil.

224
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:42,089
You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart,
are you, mister?

225
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:48,532
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing
that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!

226
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,458
Yeah, and you killed her.

227
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,193
Well, you're mountain lions.

228
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,669
Us? No, we're just kids.
 We still have our baby teeth.

229
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,091
And our baby claws.

230
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:58,397
And a dead mom.

231
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,958
There still has to be a way 
for you to kill the porcupine's baby.

232
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:06,332
What? You mean like in an abortion?

233
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:09,248
Yeah. An abortion. That can work.

234
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,438
But, we don't know how to give abortions.

235
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,876
Do you know some place we can learn, mister?

236
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,389
"Where can they learn that?" 
the boy said with a frown.

237
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,500
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."

238
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:21,522
What?!

239
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:24,420
So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.

240
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,820
And took them to where abortions are performed.

241
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:28,369
No, he didn't.

242
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,409
Yes he did.

243
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:30,685
No, he didn't!

244
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,063
Yes he did.

245
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,385
No, he didn't!!

246
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:34,844
Yes he

247
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:36,378
did!

248
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:37,795
Aw Goddamnit!

249
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:42,398
Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already,
little cubs! Fancy that!"

250
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,296
Excuse me, what are you doing here?!

251
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,200
The abortion doctor inquired.

252
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:50,051
If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!

253
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:54,016
I don't know, I, I'm supposed to show these mountain
lions how an abortion is performed or something,

254
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:55,696
I... I know, it'd ridiculous.

255
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,189
Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!

256
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,778
It's only three days until Christmas, so
I have LOTS of abortions to perform!

257
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:04,320
Gather around my table, cute little lions,

258
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,903
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!

259
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:09,745
And so the little boy
 and the cubs gathered around the chair base,

260
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:13,435
And all day watched abortion 
after abortion take place.

261
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:19,784
Christmas time is once a year.

262
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:23,940
Every critter holds it dear.

263
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,902
Every animal big or small,

264
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:31,651
Christmas means so much to us all.

265
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:35,117
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!

266
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,250
And it happens once a year.

267
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,697
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!

268
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:47,203
When we hear about how Christmas only comes

269
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,539
Once a year.

270
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,833
This better have a point, dude.
 This really better have a point.

271
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,955
It's almost time when the time is here,

272
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,781
The time that's only once a year.

273
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:59,633
Oh look. That little feller is all alone.

274
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,901
Gee, he looks sad.

275
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:04,888
Hi there!

276
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:07,624
What the hell?

277
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:10,680
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.

278
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:13,376
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.

279
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:14,987
Aww, but why?

280
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:18,284
Well, because, we don't really ...believe in Jesus.

281
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,458
Yay!

282
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,488
But does that mean you aren't baptized?

283
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:25,885
No. I'm Jewish.

284
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,807
Yay! Yay!

285
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,361
You've got to come with us!

286
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,467
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!

287
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,161
Huh?

288
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,063
Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!

289
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,243
What special time and special day,

290
00:15:38,476 --> 00:15:39,832
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

291
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,194
Hail Satan.

292
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,615
Twas the night before Christmas, 
and above the woods, way up high,

293
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:49,457
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.

294
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,234
For the world to be saved there was only one shot.

295
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:55,905
A little boy with three cubs, and an abortion plot.

296
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,676
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain
lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?

297
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:02,762
Sure. We know how to give abortions now.

298
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,335
He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,

299
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,572
but then gasped when he saw
 a most dreadful sight.

300
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:14,882
Guys, we did it!

301
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:18,153
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a
thousand years of darkness to the forest.

302
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:25,497
The Antichrist had been born, 
sealing the world's fate.

303
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:29,594
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.

304
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,940
Too late? The hell is that??

305
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:33,727
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!

306
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,123
Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!

307
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,370
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!

308
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:42,386
Now all we have to do is put
 the Antichrist into our human host.

309
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,966
Let's go! All right! Woohoo!

310
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:47,947
That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness
and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?

311
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,720
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard And
a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!

312
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,378
Wwow, look, there's Santa Claus!

313
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:58,951
Yay!

314
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,259
Let's eat his flesh!

315
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:08,558
All right, what the hell is going on?! Why
is there a red star glowing in the sky?

316
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,842
We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the
Antichrist with help from our good friend,

317
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:13,584
Stanny.

318
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,823
Death and pain await all living things.

319
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,817
LIttle boy, you should be ashamed!

320
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,865
I mean, I didn't mean to help them,
 I I tried to stop them!

321
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:26,121
Well good going, stupid! There's only one
way to stop devil-worshiping critters!

322
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:29,747
Aaaaah!

323
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,982
Dude, what the?

324
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,112
Hold steady, Santa.

325
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:39,800
Come on, dude.

326
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:46,911
Gee whiz, Santa,
 you're not gonna kill me, are you-

327
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,957
But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist?

328
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:58,195
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive
without a human host body to go into.

329
00:17:58,547 --> 00:17:59,018
No.

330
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,411
No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!

331
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,507
What? Kyle??

332
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,338
With his power, I can finally make the
earth a better place for the Jews!

333
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,982
Don't do it, Kyle!

334
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:14,573
Dude!!

335
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,205
Yes, yes!! Now the Jews will take control
of Christmas once and for all!

336
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,299
HAHA! HAAA!!

337
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,827
Oh, stop it, Cartman!

338
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,830
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading
another sentence of your stupid story!

339
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,803
I don't believe anyone interrupted YOU when
you read your Christmas story aloud,

340
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:31,289
Kyle.

341
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:35,301
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to
rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!

342
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:36,948
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?

343
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,288
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll
have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.

344
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,860
All right, fine! Forget it!

345
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,905
Wwell but, but what happened?

346
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,485
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand 
years of darkness or not?

347
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:51,977
What happens to the lion cubs?

348
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:55,077
Well, I guess we'll never know, because
Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.

349
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:57,946
No, it all worked out, right? The world was
saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.

350
00:18:58,329 --> 00:18:59,689
Dude, why do you care?!

351
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,286
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had
a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the earth.

352
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:08,238
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed
by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!

353
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,913
That's not at all what happens.

354
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,064
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.

355
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:13,267
Yeah yeah, come on!

356
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,264
All right, fine!

357
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:30,161
"Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?
" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.

358
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,361
HAHAHAA!! Now I shall rule the-

359
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:41,210
Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire!
Whoa. Oh, I don't like this!

360
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,290
I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!

361
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,620
Well what did you expect, dude? 
It's the son of the Devil.

362
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:47,915
Oh God, what have I done??

363
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,530
I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be 
the vessel for the Antichrist.

364
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:56,300
I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle!
 Santa's gonna have to kill you!

365
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,529
No Santa, don't!

366
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:02,777
We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark
creature inside him will consume his soul.

367
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,196
The little boy fretted.  He almost started to bawl

368
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.

369
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:11,658
The lion cubs!

370
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,469
The little boy quickly begun,

371
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,433
I took them to see how abortions are done.

372
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:16,601
What??

373
00:20:17,001 --> 00:20:18,949
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!

374
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,081
Get the Antichrist out of 
my friend Kyle's ass!

375
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:27,413
And in the twinkling starlight, 
each little cub did their portion.

376
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,018
They remember all they had learned
 and gave Kyle an abortion.

377
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,192
Thanks, everybody.
 I I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.

378
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,307
Well little boy, it seems that YOU

379
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:54,728
have really been through a lot. Is there any
special present you would like this year?

380
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,069
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

381
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,271
Weh, ah my, what happened?

382
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:08,291
Mommy?

383
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,981
Yay! You're back! 
We missed you, Mommy!

384
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,428
Ogh, good.

385
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:16,465
And back home, there were presents, 
and lots of food to get fat.

386
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:22,158
And it was the best Christmas ever for
the boy in the red poofball hat.

387
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,901
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle,
who died of AIDS two weeks later.

388
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:31,704
The End

389
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:32,729
Goddamnit Cartman!

390
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,213
Christmastime is once a year

391
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:40,249
Every creature holds it dear

392
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:44,101
Every animal big or small

393
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:48,096
Christmas means the world to us all

394
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:51,962
It's once a year, it's Christmastime

395
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,822
When we hear about how Christmas
 only comes Once a year.
