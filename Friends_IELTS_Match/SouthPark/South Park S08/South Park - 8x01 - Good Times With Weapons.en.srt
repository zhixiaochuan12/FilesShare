00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,044
- Stop it, Cartman!
- Pfaha, so funny.

5
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,344
Goddamnit Cartman, stope throwin'
those stupid popping things at me!

6
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:48,544
Come on and take a look, folks.
We've got a lot of knives for sale here.

7
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:51,480
Oh my God, look!

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,700
Martial arts weapons from the Far East.

9
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:56,444
Wow, cool.

10
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:00,000
Dude! We should each buy a weapon,
and then we'll be like ninjas.

11
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,765
Yeah. We won't have
to take crap from anybody.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,894
Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,174
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!

14
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,944
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid
fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,965
I'll get the tonfas. Those are so sweet.

16
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,112
I'm gonna get those killer sai.
Look Kenny!

17
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:17,743
There's something even you can afford!
A ninja shuriken for a dollar ninety nine.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,964
Can I help you boys?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,144
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,424
Okay, uh, you need to have your parents
here when you buy them, though.

21
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,598
I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen
without parents' permission.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,144
Parents? Parents?? Oh God!

23
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,615
Uh wha, what's the matter?

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,615
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents...
died in a car accident last year.

25
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:52,065
Why?! Why?! Why did you have
to take them both?! Why!

26
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:59,865
Why do people have to keep reminding
us of what we don't have??

27
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:05,365
It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry,
I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay?

28
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,165
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.

29
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,000
Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!

30
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:26,180
With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great
and powerful ninja Sharohachi,

31
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,280
born to fight evil and people I don't like.

32
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,207
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus
make me into Bounaku,

33
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,790
a deadly but compassionate ninja
who protects those in trouble.

34
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,200
What's your ninja name, Kenny?

35
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:45,565
Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who
has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies

36
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:49,880
- All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
- Kick ass!

37
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,733
Hey you guys, you know what we should do?

38
00:02:56,768 --> 00:03:00,581
We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys.
They'll be so jealous.

39
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,099
No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people.
Our parents'll find out we have them.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,100
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews
can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,044
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see
Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion,

43
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,476
and Mel Gibson says you are
a sloth and you are a liar.

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,865
And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,865
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us.
Come, ninjas, let's go.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
All right, this is it.

47
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,565
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,865
I still say this is a bad idea.

49
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,565
Ninja positions!

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,195
- Hello, Craig!
- Look what we got.

51
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,665
Where'd you get those?

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,965
We can't tell you where we got 'em!
It's secret ninja stuff.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,065
Oooh, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig?
Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,635
Uh, uh, they're not that cool.

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,865
Hyeah, "they're not that cool.
" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.

56
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,999
But don't tell anybody we have them.

57
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,650
- Whoa! Where'd you get those??
- Let me see.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,065
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys,
but we have important secret work to do.

59
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,065
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,065
Come on, ninjas!

61
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,380
Ho man, did you see the look on Craig's face?!
That was awesome!

62
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,465
Dude, we're like the coolest
kids in the whole state!

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,000
Huhey fellas. What's happenin'?

64
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,665
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.

65
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,525
Wowee! Hey, can I play, uhninjas with you?

66
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,031
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting
team sent to protect the world from evil,

67
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:29,964
and you can't play with us.

68
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,080
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make
a very good ninja. Come on, guys.

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,895
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Yes, and no time to do it. No time...

70
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,065
I think I'd make a really good ninja.

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,485
Jeez, those guys never let me play with them.
Uh they just shun me all the time.

72
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,505
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-

73
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,965
- Hi Butters.
- Hi Mom.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,485
- a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,965
And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,225
Society cast me out, and so I vowed
to make them all pay! And pay they did!

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,911
Nobody knows that beneath this
sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil,

78
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,181
the most destructive supervillain of all time!

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,465
Professor Chaos!

80
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,065
Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!

81
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,265
- Oooh, Butters, are you going out to play again?
- Yeah Mom, I'm jus' goin' outside for a little while.

82
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,339
Well, could you be a sweetie and take
that pie over there to the Thomsons.

83
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,730
I made it to thank them
for babysitting you last week.

84
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,265
Well, okay-okay Mom.

85
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,125
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way.

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,614
My ninja sense is telling me we might
be heading in the wrong direction.

87
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:01,506
Okay, hang on guys.

88
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,095
I'll use my special power to see into the future
and find out where we should head next.

89
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,694
Hold on you guys.
I actually have another power.

90
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,468
I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle.
Let me try it.

91
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:14,785
- Goddamnit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
- Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,150
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,065
No asshole! From now on you only
get to have ONE power! So what is it?!

94
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,665
I have the power to have all the powers I want.

95
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,965
That doesn't count, fatass!

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,965
Yeah, that it, Cartman!
You don't get to have any powers!

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,065
C'mon!

98
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,365
Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,665
- Who the hell is that??
- I dunno. Craig, is that you?

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,334
Fools! I am Professor Chaos!
Bringer of Destruction and Doom!

101
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,466
Your feeble ninja powers
are no match for me!

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,365
Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along.
Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa Takanawa!

104
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,985
- Hey kid, that knocks you down.
- Nuh uh!

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,954
- Yeah huh, I got you!
- Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a

106
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:13,768
...titanium alloy that shields me from heat!

107
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,065
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!

108
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,200
Well, let's see how he likes
the icy blasts from my nunchakus Sokuromoto!

109
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:32,265
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you
shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!

110
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,999
You are both trapped in spiderwebs!

111
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,999
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,203
Oh no! I have no powers!
Kyle took them away from me!

113
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,431
Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers
so I can fight this evil villain!

114
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:56,990
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,865
All right! And now I will use my power to...
turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh!

116
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,565
Goddamnit Cartman!

117
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,999
Now you are a chicken!

118
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,380
Enough! Uh I grow weary of your foolishness.
Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!

119
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,265
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!

120
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,665
- Oh, fuck dude!
- It's Butters. Oh my God!

121
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,565
- Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
- What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!

122
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,685
It hurts! It hurts!

123
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!

124
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,700
Ssh sshhhh. It's okay, Butters.
Calm down. It's not that bad, really.

125
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,150
But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'.
I gotta go to the hospitalll!!

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,285
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!

127
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,765
Guys, meeting over here for a second?

128
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,786
All right you guys, we need to stay
calm and just do the right thing.

129
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:12,309
We have to kill Butters
and bury him in Kyle's backyard.

130
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,975
- Dude, shut up!
- I agree with Cartman!

131
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,620
- What?? - You don't understand what my mom will do
to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,470
Just stay still, Butters.

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,920
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,270
Go ahead and scramble it,
then he won't remember it was us.

135
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,420
You guys can't fix my eyeball!
You have to take me to the hospital!

136
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,060
If we take him to the hospital,
they're gonna find out what happened.

137
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,400
God-damnit!

138
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,280
God? Please, if you get me out of this,
I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.

139
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,720
Don't be so quick to throw off
your ninja responsibility, Kyle.

140
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,044
Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be
a ninja when everything's going your way,

141
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,678
but it's times like these, when the chips are down,
that a ninja shows his true character.

142
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,980
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,380
Shut up, Butters. Now, there's a way out of this.
We just have to use our... ninja reasoning.

144
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,380
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital.

145
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait what
about the veterinarian?

146
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
Dr. Shafley?

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,620
He's really old and and goin blind.

148
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,700
- So if we make Butters up to look like a dog,...
- Ohh no. - We might pass him off as our pet.

149
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,820
Ohoo but, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog
with a star in my eye, I I'm gonna get grounded.

150
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,920
Shut up, Butters!

151
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,198
That is the dumbest idea you
guys have ever come up with!

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,998
I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman,
but you, Stan??

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,980
Butters needs medical attention right now!!

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,910
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle.

155
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:34,111
You take him to the hospital
and let your mom find out what happened.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,720
I need the modeling glue.
We need more fur over here.

157
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,520
Uh that modeling glue is making me dizzy.

158
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,820
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit!
Now, stop being such an asshole!

159
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,420
We need some more fur.

160
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,100
I think that's good.

161
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,820
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.

162
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,820
Wuff... wu-wuff.

163
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,360
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.

164
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,750
Okay, it's clear.

165
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,115
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's
office you need to stay down on all fours and-

166
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,280
Butters, listen!! At the vet's office,
you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,680
Wuhuff, woof, woof.

168
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,800
We've gotta hurry, it's getting late!

169
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,120
- Oh shit, somebody's coming!
- Quick, hide Butters!

170
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,320
In here!

171
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,320
Uh buh, but fellas, I gotta-

172
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,680
There you are!

173
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,400
You guys thought you were sooo cool, didn't you?!
Well look at what we got!

174
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,170
- No way, you got weapons too??
- Where'd you get those?

175
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,595
From the n-n-, from the nn-, from the nn-

176
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,195
From the nice guy at the county fair.

177
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,800
At first we needed our parents' permission,
but then we told him our parents were dead.

178
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,820
Aw man, now every
in town has a weapon! Lame!

179
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,520
So, how would you ninjas like to do battle?

180
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,100
Uh not now, Craig, we we have to be going.

181
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,680
You can't pass through this
area until you defend your honor!

182
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,290
He said, not now, Craig!

183
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,720
I am not Craig, I am Ginza,
with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,220
And I am Black Taku,
with the power of perfect spelling!

185
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,720
Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay?

186
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,220
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas?
Are you... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?

187
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,580
We're twice the ninjas you fags are!

188
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
- Then fight us!
- Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!!!

189
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,170
I swore to never fight again.

190
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,390
We don't have a choice, Kyle.
Just humor them.

191
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,060
Hey wait wait WAIT wait!

192
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,690
Hold on a second. Where's Butters?

193
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,900
Oh no. Butters!

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,490
Butters!

195
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,775
Oh, nice going, you assholes!
You made us lose him!

196
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,785
Lose who?

197
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,021
Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye,

198
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,935
and we were taking him to the vet
when you fucked it all up! Butters!

199
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,375
- Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
- Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!

200
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,315
- Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
- No dude, you gotta help us find him!

201
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,285
- The hell with that!
- We're in this together, Craig!

202
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,100
If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you,
and that's the ninja code!

203
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,490
Hello? Anybody-eh.

204
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,190
Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.

205
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,000
- Butters! - Butters! - Here, Butters!

206
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,490
Dude, look!

207
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,060
- Hello there, children!
- Hey, Chef.

208
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,998
- How's it goin'?
- Bad.

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,090
Why bad?

210
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,840
Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?

211
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,570
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you
children doin' with those weapons?

212
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,670
Nnothing, just, playing.

213
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,570
Well, you children should be careful with those.
You could put somebody's eye out.

214
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,467
- Yeah, we know.
- Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds.

215
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:46,354
They're about to start the big auction.
So long, children!

216
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,290
Oh my God! What the-? Doctor? Doctor??

217
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,790
Jesus Christ.

218
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,170
What kind of sick bastard would
do this to a dog? Poor little pup.

219
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,490
Woofwoof.

220
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,000
Can you help him, Doctor?

221
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,290
I'm afraid I wouldn't know how.
Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor.

222
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,500
- Best we call the animal shelter.
- Right away.

223
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,595
In our last episode the four ninjas did battle
with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom.

224
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,545
It was during that great battle that ninja master
Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye.

225
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,069
Now the ninjas were in serious trouble,

226
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,319
because their parents might find out they
had weapons if Professor Chaos told on them.

227
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,995
While trying to get Professor Chaos some
aid at the veterinarian's office,

228
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,000
the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends.

229
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:49,477
They challenged the four ninjas to fight,
and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began.

230
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,813
It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped,

231
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:54,978
and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces
with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos,

232
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,754
or else they would all be grounded.

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,850
- Butters!
- Butters!

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,100
Butters! Where the hell are you?!

235
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,845
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made
it to the hospital.

236
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,450
By now our parents probably know we
were playing with weapons!

237
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:11,100
- We have to get rid of the evidence!
- What?

238
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,390
Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at
least we can try to deny everything.

239
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,440
Screw that, dude, I paid 20 bucks for these things!

240
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,265
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.

241
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,380
We don't have time for that, dude!
We just have to ditch them! Now!

242
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,090
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw
your nunchakus away. If you can.

243
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,565
But you know well that your
Jewish blood won't let you.

244
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
You can't throw away something you
paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.

245
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,400
Screw you, fatass!

246
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,765
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle.

247
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,225
Right now the Jew in you is screamig
"NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"

248
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,709
You know this to be true.

249
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,759
Go ahead.
Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.

250
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,680
I, I can't do it.... I can't do it. I...

251
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,700
It's all right, Kyle.
We'll go back to the fair and return them.

252
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,000
Come on. Come on, little fella. Atta boy.

253
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,500
Right over here. Good dog. Come on.

254
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,650
There you go, right in there.

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,690
Somebody threw a ninja star
in that poor puppy's eye?

256
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,710
It just makes me sick how some
people can treat animals.

257
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,500
Well, nothing we can do for it;
let's put it to sleep, shall we?

258
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,650
Here you go, pup. I've got
a sweet dose of murder for you.

259
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,690
What the? Blasted! He's escaped!..

260
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs.

261
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,750
All right, the county fair's still open!

262
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,895
Can I help you boys?

263
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,610
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.

264
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,800
Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.

265
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,400
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us,
and you, if they found out that we bought these!

266
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,350
I thought you told me your parents were dead.

267
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,495
- You guys! You guys!
- What is it, Craig?

268
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,845
- It's Butters! We saw 'im!
- Where?!

269
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,895
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds.
He's just wandering around aimlessly.

270
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,200
- Then it's NOT too late!
- Come on, Ninjas!

271
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,000
All right, folks, our next item up
for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp.

272
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,245
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.

273
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,710
- Butters is right on the other side.
- We have to get past them!

274
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,885
All right. Looks like I have to use
my power of invisibility to get by.

275
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,090
You have that power too?

276
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,500
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold.

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,400
This way, I can move about
the crowd of people undetected.

278
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,100
- Here, hold this stuff for me.
- Good luck, Bulrog.

279
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,990
Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna
and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming.

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,600
It has a bronze finish and actual
gold leaf along the base.

281
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,650
Uh this is a rare opportunity
to own a classic antique.

282
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,190
The lamp has been appraised by our
auction staff at well over 2000 dollars.

283
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,300
So we're gonna start the bidding at 375.
Do I, do I hear 375?

284
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,900
Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'?

285
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Butters!

286
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,990
What happened to him?

287
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,600
Oh my God!

288
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:50,450
- Ohhh Jesus.
- Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.

289
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,740
All right, people, we are all extremely
upset over what's happened.

290
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,580
But let's try to speak one at a time.

291
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,299
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked
and appalled at what happened!

292
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's
the times we're living in, but something has to change!

293
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,280
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town!
The worst thing!

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,399
Yeah! I mean, there were children
watching that auction!

295
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,680
And when that little eight-year-old boy walked
up and flashed his... penis...

296
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,180
it was an outrage!

297
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,000
What?

298
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,880
What?

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,445
Not only that, the auction
was televised on public access,

300
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,550
so my little daughter watchin'
at home saw the -penis!

301
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,050
How am I suppsoed to explain that to her?!

302
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,050
This is what happens when the moral
fabric of society breaks down!

303
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,000
You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?!
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!

304
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,000
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction!

305
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,980
Dude, they don't care we knocked
Butters' eye out with weapons?

306
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,700
Just run with it, dude.

307
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,305
Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh my fragile little eight-year-old
mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing.

308
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,150
- C-Cartman should be punished!
- Yeah!

309
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,380
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!

310
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,350
Heck, I c- I can't believe it.

311
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,950
Hyeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about
violence if there's sex things to worry about.

312
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,380
So I guess this means we
get to keep our weapons.

313
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,880
Yeah. Come on, ninjas.

314
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,200
We've got some more work to do.
