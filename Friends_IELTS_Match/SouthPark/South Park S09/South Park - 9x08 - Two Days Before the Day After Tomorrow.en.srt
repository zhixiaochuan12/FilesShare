1
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:45,327
Dude, you were right cartman!
Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat!

2
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:48,202
Yeah, isn't this fun?
Just you and me hanging out, Stan.

3
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:49,740
No stupid Kyle around.

4
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:51,758
Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.

5
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:52,749
You know how?

6
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:53,739
Sure I do.

7
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:56,878
Well here...
Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.

8
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,478
Dude, I don't think your uncle would want us driving it.

9
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:02,406
Nobody's gonna know,
we'll just drive it around the marina real quick.

10
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,983
Look, if anything happens I'll take full responsibility.

11
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:11,028
Okay, turn on the ignition...

12
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:13,689
Awesome

13
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:20,396
We are not moving.

14
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,133
Maybe you have the parking brake on.

15
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:30,863
Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass.
They only have... oh wait, wait, neutral button!

16
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,376
Ahhhh!!

17
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:36,622
Other way, other way!

18
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,243
Ahhh!!

19
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:45,778
Jesus Christ!

20
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:51,928
Stan, beaver dam!
Very large beaver dam, Stan!

21
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:13,240
Oh dude.. oh Jesus..

22
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:17,268
Dude, Stan, you are in serious trouble.

23
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,800
You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy.

24
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,427
I don't even have an uncle Roy!
That was just some guy's boat I knew about.

25
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:25,062
What ?

26
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:27,780
Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen.

27
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:32,448
Okay? We were both at my house, all afternoon, playing tea party.
 Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail!

28
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,959
Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers.

29
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,898
Dude come on, we gotta get out of here!

30
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:49,016
With an eye on America and on today's events,
 it's South Park: Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker.

31
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:57,229
Crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive
 flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton,

32
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:00,625
Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam.

33
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,342
Earlier today a break in the beaver dam,
which protected the town, broke open,

34
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:08,532
trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives.

35
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:10,920
Oh my gosh, those poor people!

36
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:16,837
Tom, I'm currently 10 miles outside of Beaverton,
unable to get inside the town proper.

37
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:23,554
We do not have any reports of fatalities yet,
but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions.

38
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:28,808
Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand,
Tom, so this would be quite devastating.

39
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,521
Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch?

40
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:36,399
We-we're not sure what exactly is going inside
the town of Beaverton, Tom,

41
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:41,420
but we're reporting that there's looting, raping,
and yes, even acts of canibalism.

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,403
My God, you've actually seen people looting,
raping and eating each other?

43
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:49,437
No, no we haven't actually seen it,
Tom, we're just reporting it.

44
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,329
Y'all done with your fish sticks, Stan?

45
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,370
I'll help you Sharon.
Boy, that's just awful.

46
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,996
In the nearby town of South Park,
the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated.

47
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:03,687
That's right, we know whose fault this is.

48
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:04,445
Oh oh...

49
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,792
It's George Bush's fault!

50
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!

51
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,824
George Bush didn't break that beaver dam!
It was terrorists and Al-Qaeda!

52
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:19,073
They've been secretly building beaver dam WMD's for years now!

53
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,991
Yeah, yeah! WMD's WMD's!

54
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:28,771
Mom, dad...
they-they're gonna go help those people, right?

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,138
I don't know. You know, to me it seems like the mayor of Beaverton
 should have done something that dam years ago.

56
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:38,349
Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA?
I think this whole thing is really their fault.

57
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:44,875
Yeah, bu-but, s-somebody's gonna help
the people off their rooftops, right?

58
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:49,571
That's not important right now, son.
What's important is figuring out whose fault this is.

59
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,897
Dude, dude! Did you see the news last night?

60
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:01,931
Yeah.

61
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,244
You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?

62
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,955
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

63
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,168
Pretty funny?! Dude we did that!!
That was our fault.

64
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:17,299
Hey hey, no way. We aren't the ones who built a town beneath 
a giant beaver dam, okay? That's their fault!

65
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:19,293
But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them.

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,026
Well they should'a gotten out of there.

67
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,662
Mabye they couldn't get out.

68
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,374
We did.

69
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:28,130
Dude, I-I just.. I-I don't know what to do here.

70
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,033
Ah ah! I know what you're thinking, Stan.
You're thinking you're gonna tell Kyle.

71
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:35,051
Look, I know you think he's your best friend,
but Kyle is a Jew rat.

72
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,786
He has his Jew ethics, while he whores his greedy Jew gold,
and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!

73
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:43,860
Hey dudes. Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday.
What did you guys do?

74
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:45,959
Nothing.

75
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,152
Heh, totally.

76
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,285
Hey everybody!
They just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton!

77
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:55,852
Aww, crap!

78
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,341
Quiet, children, quiet. We need to hear.

79
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:02,569
At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break.

80
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:09,830
But now, shocking new evidence has indicated that
 the flood in Beaverton was caused by... Global warming!

81
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:11,403
Ohh!

82
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:17,168
It now appears that.. all rumors of global warming were true.

83
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:24,017
We were warned this would happen, and.. we didn't listen.
We didn't listen!

84
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:31,276
All the top Colorado geologists have gathered
at the governor's office for an emergency meeting.

85
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,036
Ladies and gentlemen, if global warming
 has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood,

86
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:42,256
then this is only the beginning.

87
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:49,791
The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at
is a global warming catastrophe,
the likes of which we've never seen.

88
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,535
Excuse me, sir, but when?
When is this going to happen?

89
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:06,145
My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests,
but - we believe it may happen the day after tomorrow.

90
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:16,478
Excuse me! I'm sure we're all very impressed
with your wild theories, Dr. Marsh,

91
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,770
but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed
that global warming exists.

92
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:24,956
Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?

93
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:33,138
ith all due respect, Cliche Descending Republican,
the economy isn't going to matter the day after tomorrow.

94
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,565
Listen! Listen! We finished running the tests.

95
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:45,802
Global warming is going to strike two days
before the day after tomorrow.

96
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,932
Oh my God. That's today!

97
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,096
We didn't listen!

98
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,918
Stan, get in the car!
We have to evacuate!

99
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,787
We didn't listen!

100
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,659
Come on, come on!

101
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,605
It's useless, this traffic isn't moving.

102
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:32,433
Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming?
I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam after all.

103
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:38,837
No Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down.
We didn't take care of our Earth,
and now you've inherited our problems.

104
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:39,821
We didn't listen!

105
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,546
We did listen! Come on, everyone grab what you can,
we have to walk.

106
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,011
Oh Jesus, here it comes!

107
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,366
Global warming!!

108
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:09,867
It's coming! Here comes global warming!
We didn't listen!!

109
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,119
Come on, hurry!

110
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,554
It's right behind us!

111
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,198
It's coming the other way!

112
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,356
Go back, go back!

113
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,047
Everyone into the community center!
Hurry, go!

114
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,036
Get inside, we have to close these doors!

115
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:03,270
Come on, we've got to board up that last window.
Seal up all the doorways.

116
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,033
We must try to protect ourselves
from the global warming.

117
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,935
Mr. Garrison, are you alright?

118
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:14,006
I'm in pretty bad shape. My leg is broken,
and my left boob is leaking.

119
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,345
Here you go, sweetheart.

120
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:20,015
Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton
are still trapped in the flood.

121
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:25,331
I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie.
We have to try and save ourselves now.

122
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:27,666
Shh, shh, we've got the television working.

123
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:33,070
This is a Fox news update: Global warming disaster!

124
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:37,480
Global warming seems to have struck, 
as predicted, in the Colorado Rockies.

125
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,569
All around the country panic
and chaos are settling in.

126
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:47,332
Tom, I'm standing just outside of Chicago where the panic
of global warming has already caused countless deaths.

127
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:52,495
Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago
is over six hundred billion people.

128
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:55,982
Oh God.

129
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:58,808
This is all your fault, Jimbo!

130
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,172
Me?

131
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:05,062
Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around.
You didn't even think about global warming, did ya?!

132
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:12,723
Can you believe it Stan? I never thought global warming
could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen.

133
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:17,051
Kyle, it.. it isn't global warming.

134
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:18,442
Huh?

135
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:23,279
Global warming isn't happening right now.
It's not what caused the Beaverton flood.

136
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,595
How do you know that?

137
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,543
Because.. I know what did cause the flood.

138
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,574
George Bush?

139
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:29,950
No.

140
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,907
- Terrorists?
- No.

141
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:34,013
- Communists?
- No.

142
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,193
- Chinese radicals?
- No.

143
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:36,719
Cartman?

144
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:38,148
Sort of.

145
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:39,826
Cartman flooded Beaverton?!

146
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:43,308
Shhh. N-Not exactly. 
We were messing around on this guy's new boat,

147
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,599
and Cartman egged me on, 
and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.

148
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,359
Dude you have to tell everyone, right now!

149
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:52,986
Hey Stan.

150
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,118
Oh god damnit, you told Kyle didn't you?

151
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:02,460
Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs.
Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.

152
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,376
Ah, here we go. See, I told you.
 If you're so caring, Kyle,

153
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:08,119
why don't you share some of your Jew gold 
with the people caught in the flood?

154
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,641
Look, maybe.. maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves?

155
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,621
How?

156
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:13,433
Why?

157
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:20,084
We can sneak out of here, get a boat and go help them off their roofs.
That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.

158
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:25,044
Listen, listen everyone.
Nobody can leave this building.

159
00:12:25,373 --> 00:12:28,592
But.. we need supplies - food, silicone.

160
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,449
You go outside and you'll die.

161
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,790
By now the global warming has shifted the climate,
 bringing on a new ice age.

162
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,797
Within thehour the temperature outside will fall to
over seventy million degress below zero.

163
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,698
Jezus.

164
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:47,353
All we can do is try to wait it out, as long as we can.

165
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,394
And the rest of the country?

166
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:54,590
Everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south.

167
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,994
Everyone above this line is already dead.

168
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:01,412
People like us, in the middle states, have to ride it out.

169
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:08,526
The south western states might have a chance,
but New York will have tidal waves that will envelope
all of the north east.

170
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:18,696
What, Frank?

171
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:25,556
Oh, oh God damn it!

172
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:42,831
Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please.
Any day now.

173
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,913
Why haven't they come for us?

174
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:47,381
I-I don't know.

175
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:50,228
Wait, look! Here comes a boat!

176
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:52,389
Really? Oh it's about time!

177
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,358
Oh Kevin, we're saved!

178
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:56,803
It looks like.. three little boys.

179
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:01,026
Hey we'll take it! Over here, yes!
Thank you, thank you!

180
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:20,150
Oh thanks, thanks. That's a lot better.

181
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:24,248
We can't get out! The flames are too big.

182
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,147
Oh, great. You see Stan, 
this is what you get for listening to Kyle.

183
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,628
"Oh, you gotta help those people, 
it's your responsibility."

184
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:35,988
Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did
so your parents can help us.

185
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,641
Stan? Stan?

186
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,159
Randy, we've looked everywhere. Kyle's missing too.

187
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,955
Oh my God! Where would they go?

188
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,495
Randy, Randy. Your son's on the phone.

189
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:53,638
Stan?

190
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:55,516
Ah, hey dad.

191
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:57,407
Stan, you're alive!

192
00:14:57,407 --> 00:15:00,993
Dad, we-we're trapped in Beaverton,
we were trying to save everyone.

193
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:07,422
Stan, listen to me. You must stay indoors. Do not try to go out.
Global warming has brought in a new ice age

194
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:10,329
No dad, listen. I need to tell you something.

195
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,312
What is it, son?

196
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,914
Nothing. Can you just come get us please?

197
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,738
You just stay put son. I'm coming for you.
Do you hear me? I'm coming for you!

198
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:25,810
Randy, where are you going?

199
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,437
I'm going to Beaverton.

200
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:29,904
You can't go out there, you'll freeze to death.

201
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:31,956
My son is counting on me.

202
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,035
I'm going with you.

203
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:35,106
You can't go out there, you'll freeze to death.

204
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,286
You can't do this alone!

205
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,446
Let me go, too.

206
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:39,862
You can't go out there, you'll freeze to death.

207
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,567
Alright come on both of you. We've got to pull together
every warm piece of clothing we can find.

208
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,324
Steven! Steven you have to keep moving!

209
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:11,783
I can't go on... feel so hot...

210
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:16,377
Feeling warm is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia.

211
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:20,153
Oh Jesus, I feel warm too!

212
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:29,391
Yeah me too. Steven, we've gotta keep moving. We're in deep
hypothermia, all of us. We've gotta keep the blood flowing.

213
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:35,648
Maybe we should strip our jackets off..
and warm our bodies next to each other?

214
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:43,008
Don't be a fag! Come on, we can make it.
We have to try!

215
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:53,122
Come on people, we're running out of time. We need all
army helicopters to the southern states for evacuation now!

216
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:58,705
Sir, more people in Beaverton are calling. 
They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.

217
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:01,354
Tell them that the government can't help.
 But that we're very sorry.

218
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,179
You know the plan people, 
we can only evacuate citizens below this line.

219
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,113
Ex-excuse me, General?

220
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:07,661
What?!

221
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:13,162
We've just compiled some new information. The flood in
Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all.

222
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:13,615
What?

223
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,595
We know the truth now. 
We know what caused it.

224
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:23,082
Oh, my God. Rick, radio the helicopters!

225
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,558
Help! Help!

226
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,836
Dude, this whole building is going to collapse.

227
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,071
We have to find a way out.

228
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:45,037
Don't worry everyone, the government is here to save you.

229
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:50,912
Oh well, thank you so much.
What a swift and speedy resuce.

230
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,566
It's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone.

231
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,658
Not so fast, Kyle.

232
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:02,704
What are you doing?

233
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,408
Hand over the gold.

234
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,118
What gold?!

235
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,821
You know what I'm talking about.

236
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:11,733
No Cartman,
I have no idea what you're talking about.

237
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:16,029
All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks.
Hand it over!

238
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:16,986
Guys come on!

239
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:20,658
Jews do not carry gold in a little bag around their necks,
 Cartman. Stop playing around.

240
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,474
I'm not playing around, Kyle. If we survive this I don't
intend to live in poverty. Give me your Jew gold now!

241
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:30,076
Dude we don't have time for your stupid jokes,
we're gonna die!

242
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,462
Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold.
The decision is yours Kyle.

243
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:37,691
God damn it, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag
around my neck Cartman! What do you want from me?

244
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:40,124
I want your Jew gold.

245
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:47,331
Okay fine, here! Now let's go.

246
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:49,838
Do you think I'm stupid?

247
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,164
I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around
 their necks to keep their real bags of gold safe.

248
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,845
Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle.

249
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:07,048
No, noo!!

250
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,344
Hey, wait up you assholes! God..

251
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,682
Hey look everybody, helicopters!

252
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,342
They've got the boys!

253
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:29,191
Global warming must be over.

254
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,284
We made it!

255
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,552
Stanley!

256
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,562
Kyle!

257
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:45,560
Stan? We found Stan!

258
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:50,414
So does this mean the storm has passed?
Global warming is over?

259
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:58,971
Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood.
We know now whose fault it is. It was... crab people!

260
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:05,278
Crab people.. crab people..

261
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:09,854
Stop it, stop it! First it was terrorists,
 then George Bush and global warming

262
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,732
and now you're all blaming crab people 
for something that's very simple.

263
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:15,677
It's my fault. I broke the dam.

264
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,301
Oh, man...

265
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:24,062
Stanley? You?

266
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,671
No. Don't you see what this child is saying?

267
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:31,573
We can't spend all our energy placing blame
 when somehting bad happens.

268
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:34,434
He's saying - we all broke the dam.

269
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,871
No, I broke the dam.

270
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,592
I broke the dam.

271
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,184
I broke the dam.

272
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,170
I broke the dam.

273
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,641
No, I broke the dam.

274
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,065
And I broke the dam.

275
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:48,670
I broke the dam.

276
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,157
Heh heh, I broke the dam, heh.

277
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,648
I broke the dam.

278
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:57,444
I broke the dam.
I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it.

279
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:02,659
I broke the dam.

280
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,051
No, I broke the f***ing dam!

281
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:08,253
I broke the dam.

282
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:09,948
I literally broke the dam!

283
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:13,148
I broke the dam.

284
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,763
On a boat. That wasn't mine!

285
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,471
I broke the dam.

286
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:19,252
I kept it secret for two days!

287
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,567
I broke the dam.

288
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,911
The boat caught on fire! And it exploded!

289
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:28,166
I broke the dam.

290
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,673
Oh, f*** it!

291
