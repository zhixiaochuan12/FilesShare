3
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:43,679
Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber.
I'll be performing your surgery today.

4
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,479
God bless you, Doctor.
I know you'll make me well again.

5
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:52,207
Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?

6
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:58,492
My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body.
A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.

7
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:00,332
All right, then let's begin.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,709
Just relax, Mr. Garrison.

9
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:08,663
I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation,
they would know how perfectly natural it is.

10
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:13,001
The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,134
With the scrotum open,
I can now discard of your testicles.

12
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:23,099
So long, balls.

13
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:29,789
Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,269
Oh, that stings.

15
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:36,238
Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.

16
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,278
OH! Oh jeez.

17
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:44,422
All we need to do now is ...stuff the
...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis...

18
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,507
And now I'll use the skin from
your penis to make vaginal lips.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,555
Do I look like a woman?

20
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:54,835
Pretty much.

21
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:03,696
Dude, don't be nervous.

22
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:07,560
How can I not be nervous? Trying out for
the All-State team has been my dream for years.

23
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,883
You're the best player at our school, dude.
You'll make the team for sure.

24
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,365
This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.

25
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:14,178
I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman!

26
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,108
All students trying out for
the All-State team to center court!

27
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,372
Good luck.

28
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:27,331
All right boys, now you're all here because
you're the best of the best.

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,611
I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far,
so let's get out there and SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT!

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,226
Excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?

31
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,182
Yeah?

32
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,241
Can we talk to you for a minute?

33
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,697
You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?

34
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,900
Yep! I love basketball.
I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.

35
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:10,625
Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude.
But you're just not physically ...built for the game.

36
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:12,408
Oo whataya mean?

37
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:16,429
Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.

38
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,585
Awwright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,531
Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.

40
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,985
Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right?

41
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,204
That's all you could do.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,780
Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!
You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,147
Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at
a totally inappropriate time.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,348
I know. I deserve it.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,277
Yeah, you know why?
Because Jews can't play basketball!

46
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:10,132
You're right.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,738
Jesus, that was fun...

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,551
Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!

49
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:22,981
Believe what?

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,731
It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T
Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now!

51
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,592
Hello everybody!

52
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,561
Can you believe it ladies? I'm one of YOU now!

53
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,338
Wow, just look at all these tampons!

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,925
Regular, heave flow- Oh boy,
I can't wait till I get my first period!

55
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,715
Hi gals! Oh boy, can you believe
the sales they're havin' out there?

56
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,641
Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina
for the first time.

57
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,482
Give us a hug. Girls' Club!

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh wow! This is great.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,503
Look at that, I'm peeing sittin'
down like a dainty dignified little woman.

60
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,649
Sany, any of you ladies wanna
go see a sad movie together?

61
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,218
You guys try those new wings tampons?
Do those work well?

62
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:35,326
Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude.
So you aren't built right for basketball.

63
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:38,745
But I feel like a basketball player.
That's all I wanna do.

64
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:43,386
Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher!
Mrs. Garrison!

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,067
You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.

66
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,304
I had a sex-chamge operation.

67
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:53,930
My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing
womanhood for the first time in my life!

68
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,324
See ya in class!

69
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:03,878
Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?

70
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:08,458
What? Th'um, nuh-nothing.
I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older.

71
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:12,738
But our teacher, Mr. Garrison?
He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?

72
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:13,720
Penis!

73
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,194
Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God!

74
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,353
Vagina!

75
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:21,267
That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL!

76
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:26,542
Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you!
You shouldn't judge people who want to change.

77
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:30,104
He's a teacher! How are we supposed
to explain this to our children?!

78
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:31,677
It's very simple.

79
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:38,073
You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside
doesn't reflect who they are on the inside.

80
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:39,788
Yeah. That's right.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,382
They feel like they're somebody trapped
in another person's body.

82
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:49,940
And so, they can have a surgery that makes
them more into the person they see themselves as.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,377
- Do you understand???
- Totally! I totally understand!

84
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,756
There. You see, Gerald?
He totally understands.

85
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,968
So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.

86
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,676
Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman,
and you made him into one.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,233
Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.

88
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,501
Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?

89
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:18,297
Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man.
That procedure is called a peniplasty.

90
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,577
No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.

91
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:23,347
...You what?

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,200
I hate being small and Jewish.
I feel like a tall black man.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,844
Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,937
- Yeah!
- Wha-a-a negroplasty??

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,503
It's a fairly common procedure, really,
just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had.

96
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,354
Let's take a look here.

97
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,058
What we do is slice your face and peel it back so
we can insert now pig-ment producing cells inside.

98
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,608
We break the arm bones in several places
and put braces to make them longer.

99
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:58,528
Now, the knees we need to snap off
and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement.

100
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,502
And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty
to enhance the genitalia.

101
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,959
Negroplasty takes about seven hours
and costs roughly 3000$.

102
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,594
Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?

103
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:15,110
Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black.
Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,098
Hello, Mr. Slave. Boy have I been busy.
A woman's work is never done.

105
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,123
I got some tampons.
I should be getting my period really soon.

106
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,710
I hope I don't get too emotional
and drive you crazy with my PMS.

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,235
Mr. Slave, I got somethin' for us, too.

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,746
Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?

109
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,588
- No thanks.
- Nu- no thanks?

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,621
Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,665
I can't believe you just went ahead
and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.

112
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,758
Well, I ASSUMED you supported me.
It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.

113
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,034
But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!

114
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:07,393
Don't you even care that I was suffering?
I wasn't happy the way I was!

115
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:12,318
It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped
to think about how other people around you would feel!

116
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,530
Look, we can still be together.
All you have to do is stop being gay!

117
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,336
- How can you say that?! You're gay too!
- I'm not gay! I'm a woman!

118
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,129
Oh, Jezuth Christh!

119
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:28,246
Oh, so is that it?! You're just gonna walk out?!
You men are all alike!

120
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:32,700
Go ahead and find somebody
who doesn't have a vagina, you fag!

121
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,689
Mom! Dad! I have awesome news!

122
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:41,185
The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change
said he can make me tall and black.

123
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:42,972
What??

124
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:47,176
Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so
I can finally look the way I've always wanted.

125
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:51,521
He even took my picture and then did computer imaging
to show what I would look like after the surgery.

126
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,397
Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?!

127
00:09:56,397 --> 00:10:01,125
This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you!
Now your son wants to be transracial!

128
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:03,438
Can I have 3000$ ? Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??

129
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,710
- Absolutely not, Kyle!
- But why not?

130
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,776
You said sometimes people need surgery
to make them feel better about themselves.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,737
Yes, but Kyle...

132
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:15,230
Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop,
I watch UPN and I love playing basketball!

133
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,188
My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.

134
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,786
Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is.

135
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:25,000
- Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
- The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,962
- But Jews can't play basketball!
- Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!

137
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,873
I'm never speaking to either of you ever again!

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,191
- Oh, that does it!
- Where are you going?!

139
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,283
That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off!

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,120
Who the hell do you think you are?!

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
Dr. Biber.

142
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:56,000
What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically
alter my son into a tall African-American?!

143
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:00,915
- Oh, you're Kyle's father.
- Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer!

144
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,523
And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice,
and your clinic shut down!!

145
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,507
What is that on your shirt?

146
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:10,437
What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins. Why?

147
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,429
Ahhh you like dolphins, hm?

148
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,268
I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of...
But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-

149
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,630
I can make you one.

150
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:22,358
...What?

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,588
Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head.

152
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:29,201
 Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...

153
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,822
Make me a... dolphin?

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:47,633
If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...
Why can't I swim with the dolphins?

155
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,256
No, no, it's crazy.

156
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:57,899
There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look
 on the outside the way they feel on ths inside.

157
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,856
It's Girls Gone Wild!

158
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,254
These gilrs will do anything!

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,046
Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?!
 Oh what the hell!

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,453
Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down!

161
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,028
Boy, men will do just about anything 
to get a look at our tits, won't they?

162
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,051
Men are all the same.
 My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag.

163
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:37,121
 But I've been livin' it up ever since, 
havin' sex with all kinds of different guys!

164
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,216
Girl power!

165
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,841
You know, the strange thing is,
 I haven't gotten my period yet.

166
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,513
 Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?

167
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,370
Well, normally, if a woman misses her period,
 it means she's pregnant.

168
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:56,317
...Pregnant? Oh my God. Of course.

169
00:12:56,341 --> 00:13:01,505
I haven't gotten to experience a period because...
 one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.

170
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,923
I'm pregnant, everybody!
 Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion!

171
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,587
Gerald! What happened to you?!

172
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,615
That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. 
Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been.

173
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,358
Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin!

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,860
 A dolphin?!?!

175
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,199
 Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle.

176
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:37,567
 If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny
 hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself?

177
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,913
- Gerald, this is crazy!...
- I used to think I was crazy.

178
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:47,102
But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other
 people out there who are transpecies.

179
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,853
All I did is change my appearance
 to look the way I felt... here.

180
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:59,176
And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same,
 he may never be happy. Ever!

181
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,077
We owe him more than that, Sheila. 
We owe him understanding!

182
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,404
Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!

183
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,255
- What?
- Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro!

184
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,833
- Can't believe it.
- Did it hurt?

185
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,632
Yeah, but it was totally worth it.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,057
- Jesus Christ, dude! 
- Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! 

187
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:28,395
My dad is even gonna take me back down to 
the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!

188
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,217
- Come on, Kyle, we should get going!
-  All right, Dad!

189
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:39,606
- Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
- He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,226
You here for an abortion too? Yeah, I discovered a few days
 ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. 

191
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:52,299
Is this doctor any good?

192
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,523
- Mrs... Garrison?
- Oh, that's me.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,017
Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion.

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,948
- ...an abortion? 
- Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. 

195
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,735
Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?

196
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,554
If you want you can just scramble 
it and I'll queef it out myself.

197
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,300
- Mmister Garrison
- Mrs. Garrison.

198
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:21,114
Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.

199
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:25,657
Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!
A woman has a right to choose!

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,596
No, I mean you're physically unable to have 
an abortion, because you can't get pergnant.

201
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,613
- But I missed my period.
- You can't have periods either.

202
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:42,175
You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't 
have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.

203
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:49,002
You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have
 a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?

204
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,179
N-that's right.

205
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:55,907
But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman.
 This would mean I I'm not really a woman. 

206
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:59,349
Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just 
a guy with a mutilated penis!

207
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,011
Basically, yes.

208
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,927
...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.

209
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:13,309
- Hey asshole!
- Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!

210
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:17,224
- You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
- I gave you a sex change.

211
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:21,905
Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions
 and bleed out her snatch once a month?! 

212
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:26,184
You made me into a FREAK is what you did!
 And I want you to change me back!

213
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:27,498
Am I a man yet?

214
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:31,630
- Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs.
- Why the hell not?!

215
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:37,477
Because I've already used your testicles to fashion
 new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.

216
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:38,622
You WHAT?!

217
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:44,000
And your scrotum has been made into
a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.

218
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,261
Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find
my ball and scrotum right now, Mr. Man!

219
00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:00,704
Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between 
the best fourth-grade players from Colorado 

220
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,863
and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming.

221
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:07,907
Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,596
- Who are you?
- Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski.

223
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,360
 I had a negroplasty.
 Can I play in the All-State team now?

224
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,737
Well, you're tall and black enough.
 All right, Broflovski, suit up!

225
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:22,977
- All right! Dad, I can play!
- All right Kyle!

226
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:29,144
Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,325
- Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home.
- Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.

228
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:44,542
- He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.
- What?

229
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,892
Well, ah I only made him look
 like he could play basketball.

230
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,132
 If he actually does it, 
the testicle in his knees will explode!

231
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:54,298
What?! But you made him into a basketball player.

232
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:58,308
No, I just made him look more like one. 
We have to stop him from playing! 

233
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,108
Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls!

234
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:06,136
Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to
 my balls before Kyle hurts himself!

235
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,064
Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens.

236
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,721
I'm a hundred percent ready, coach!

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,473
Excuse me, where, where is 
the bathroom for dolphins?

238
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:35,217
We don't... have one.

239
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:39,206
Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom?
 I I need a large tank with salt water.

240
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,012
Too bad?

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,760
Damnit you people have to make
 special arrangements for transpecies people like me!

242
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,512
- I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!
- You're a lawphin?

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,975
- Tickets please.
- We don't have tickets!

244
00:18:56,226 --> 00:19:01,450
- Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry.
- Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!

245
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:07,656
- What?
- That dolphin has my scrotum!

246
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,633
- Now let us in!
- You can't go in, ma'am!

247
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,475
We have unauthorized entry on level one!

248
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:20,163
- All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession.
- All right!

249
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:26,701
- Gerald, where's Kyle?!
- What? Why??

250
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:29,851
My balls are in his knees.
 If he jumps with them they'll explode!

251
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,802
Oh my God!

252
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,165
- There they are, next to that dolphin!
- Come on, we've gotta get to those balls!

253
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,045
Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee!

254
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:44,233
Now substituting for Colorado, 
number 8, Kyle Broflovski.

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,544
Oh Jesus, he's about to play!

256
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,912
Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!

257
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:54,793
Which one is he??

258
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,386
- Hey, what the hell?!
- Stop the game!

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,431
I got it! I got the ball.

260
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:16,767
- Kyle, NO!
- Broflovski goes for the dunk!

261
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:26,155
NO! My baaaallllssss.

262
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,139
So let me get this straight. 

263
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:52,656
That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which
 were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.

264
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,543
Yeah, that's basically it.

265
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,655
Sounds like an open and shut case.
 All right, let's head 'em out!

266
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:02,226
I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you
the surgery was cosmetic only.

267
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,957
So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?

268
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:10,087
Let's get you two up to the clinic 
and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee.

269
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,465
But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.

270
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,020
You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman,
I think I still like the new me.

271
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,408
I'd rather be a woman who can't
have periods than a fag.

272
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,543
Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman!
Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!
