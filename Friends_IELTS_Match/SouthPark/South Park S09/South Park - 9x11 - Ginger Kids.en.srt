1
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:40,967
Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun,
though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it.

2
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:44,191
I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System.
Thank you.

3
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:48,988
Okay, very nice, Token.
Thank you.

4
00:00:49,023 --> 00:00:53,833
'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more
speech today, so let's have ah Eric.

5
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,459
Thank you, Mrs. Garrison.

6
00:00:56,494 --> 00:01:01,839
My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair,
light skin, and freckles."

7
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,767
We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store,
walking on the streets -

8
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,342
they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs.

9
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,686
I'm talking of course about... ginger kids.

10
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,859
Aww sick! Gross!

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,220
Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes
very light skin, red hair, and freckles.

12
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,812
Aw, nasty! Yuck!

13
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:30,431
This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs
because ginger kids have no souls.

14
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,266
What ?

15
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,573
Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured

16
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,119
Ah sick!

17
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:38,771
Gross!

18
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,525
Yeck.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,858
Because their skin is so light,
ginger kids must avoid the sun.

20
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:46,484
Not unlike... vampires.

21
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:51,785
That's not true, fatass! I have red hair,
and I don't have to avoid the sun!

22
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:54,005
I was getting to that, if you will let me.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,253
Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles.

24
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:59,710
These people are called "daywalkers."

25
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,367
Ho! Daywalkers!

26
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:04,881
This is all a bunch of crap!

27
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,068
Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult
time with all these interruptions...

28
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,203
Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.

29
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:14,314
It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech!
People aren't creeped out by gingers!

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
I am.

31
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,935
Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so
with your paper tomorrow!

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,970
Fine, I will.

33
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:23,785
Fine! In the meantime,
shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!

34
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:26,759
Let's see, where was I?
Oh yes!

35
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:29,622
Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,

36
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:34,820
and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse,
the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time.

37
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:39,729
It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers
are vile and disgusting.

38
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:44,483
In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think
that the ginger problem is not a serious one,

39
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,735
think again.

40
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,327
Stupid supremist asswipe!

41
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,502
Dude, what's the big deal?

42
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,442
What's the big deal??

43
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:57,149
Don't you understand what ignorant
prejudice like that can lead to?

44
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,272
I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors!

45
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,736
Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,114
What about the Foley family?
I think they're all ginger.

47
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:08,392
Hello?

48
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:12,182
Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about
people with red hair and freckles.

49
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,678
Can I ask you a few questions?

50
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:14,909
Sure. Come on in.

51
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:19,331
Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,815
What? Heh, hello there, kids.

53
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:25,845
We... came to learn the facts about people
with red hair, light skin and freckles.

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,392
Oho, gingers, yes.
Our cute little red-haired rascals.

55
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:33,512
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
You both have dark hair and brown eyes.

56
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,082
Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene
is recessive in both our families' DNA.

57
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,282
Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired
freckled child were only one in four.

58
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:45,459
And still it happened.
Three times.

59
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:47,438
What are the odds?

60
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,317
A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know.

61
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:58,991
If your spouse is also a carrier, then your
children can turn out like... them.

62
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,037
Each one of them's a blessing.

63
00:04:02,072 --> 00:04:04,062
Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing.

64
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:05,402
Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.

65
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:06,624
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

66
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,296
But it's... it's not true they... have no souls.

67
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:16,173
No... no, I'm sure they do.

68
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,221
Well it was nice meeting you boys.
We've gotta get dinner started.

69
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,077
I just had a couple more questions about-

70
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:24,666
Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have
ginger kids, marry an Asian woman.

71
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,802
Asians don't carry the recessive gene.

72
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:30,419
I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman
very soon for just that reason.

73
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,091
And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles
are all passed down genetically.

74
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,826
A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,

75
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,713
but by the melanins which control the pigment
in all of our skins. Thank you.

76
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:56,965
Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and sciency for my taste,
but there you go.

77
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:59,408
All right, that's lunch, kids.

78
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:03,195
We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian
cheerleaders after recess.

79
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,387
That was a very informative speech, Kyle.

80
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:07,354
Thanks Butters

81
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,202
Informative if you want to die.

82
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,522
Guys, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker.
Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves.

83
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,862
Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil.

84
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,539
You know who was ginger? Judas.

85
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:21,625
And what did Judas do?
Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.

86
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:26,513
Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks:
Gingers are creepy.

87
00:05:26,548 --> 00:05:30,818
And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room,
the gingers are gonna getcha.

88
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,678
They're gonna GETCHA!

89
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,670
You buying school lunch today?

90
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,551
Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.

91
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:38,530
Right this way!

92
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,987
You can't eat in the cafeteria

93
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,401
How come ?

94
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,163
Ginger kids eat in the hallway!

95
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:47,459
Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard!

96
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,012
There! You see?! This is what happens when
Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!

97
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:58,509
That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could
see what it felt like to be ginger.

98
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:01,340
Hey.
That's a great idea!

99
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:04,567
Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's
house tonight at around midnight?

100
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:05,417
Sure, for what?

101
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,767
We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!

102
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,507
Okay dude, knock him out

103
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,538
Dude, dude okay, he's out!

104
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:43,959
Kyle, that's good!

105
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,034
All right, let's do it.

106
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,692
Eric honey, time to get up for school.

107
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:17,735
Poopsiekins!

108
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:21,439
Sweetie, what is the-

109
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,406
I'M GINGER!

110
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,036
Oh my God! Eric!

111
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,222
Help me! Hellp mee!

112
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,075
Well, all his vital signs are still normal.

113
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,063
>From his outward appearance, I would say
he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.

114
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:38,987
You mean...

115
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:42,896
Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.

116
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:46,007
And how could I become a ginger now?!
I wasn't born like this!

117
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,093
Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene.

118
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,121
It must've stayed dormant in your system
until you hit adolescence.

119
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:53,591
So I'm gonna stay like this forever?

120
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:55,102
I'm sorry, son.

121
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,996
Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you?

122
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,458
Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you.

123
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:05,757
I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids,
but you need to understand, there is no cure.

124
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,008
Your son will be ginger his whole life.

125
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:11,115
You might want to just... put him down.

126
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:17,984
Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens
my mom loves me, no matter what I look like!

127
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:18,559
Right mom ?

128
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,360
Mom?!

129
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,082
Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.

130
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,170
All right, but... you're gonna have to
take certain precautions now.

131
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:33,504
It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun.
The sun... is his worst enemy

132
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,419
Hey dudes, what's goin' on?

133
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,751
How is everything with you guys?

134
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,179
Wow, Cartman. You look... different.

135
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,740
Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle.

136
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:54,080
I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently
I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.

137
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,654
You mean,you're a ginger?

138
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,427
Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.

139
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:01,342
Is that an umbrella you're using?

140
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:01,898
Yes, Kyle

141
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,419
The sun's rays are bad for my skin,
so I need to be protected when I'm outside.

142
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:09,120
Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way,
and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.

143
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:12,085
Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?

144
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,144
What do you mean, Kyle?

145
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,337
Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping
on ginger kids and now you are one.

146
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,029
Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle.

147
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,782
That's fine, get it out of the way...

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,538
Dude, this is going awesome.

149
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,327
Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time.

150
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:57,919
What are you doing?

151
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,776
I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?

152
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,000
You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.

153
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,135
Huh?

154
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,697
You know the rule.
No ginger kids in the cafeteria.

155
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,814
But... it's me.

156
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,175
Right. And you're a ginger

157
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,790
Dude, check it out

158
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:19,586
Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not
like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside.

159
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:26,603
Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here,
then the others are gonna start coming.

160
00:10:26,638 --> 00:10:28,780
Yeah, beat it, j... jackass.

161
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,747
We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson.

162
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:42,873
I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long
hard think about how he treated gingers.

163
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,436
I want to thank everyone for showing up today.

164
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:52,047
I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you,
but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against!

165
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:54,651
Just because we have red hair,
light skin and freckles,

166
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,845
we're thought of as somehow less important,
and it's bullcrap!

167
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,162
Yeah !

168
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:02,851
Kids at school laugh at us,
doctors call us "genetically inferior."

169
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:07,796
The world needs to know that we are people,
with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!

170
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,518
My dad says that each one of my freckles
is a kiss from an angel.

171
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,877
...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer!

172
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:22,609
We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about al
l the great people in history who were ginger. People like...

173
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,303
Ron Howard?

174
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:35,140
Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...

175
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,498
Ron Howard?

176
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:43,199
Right! We already had him, but right!
See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society!

177
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,012
We need to let everyone in this school know
that we are not inferior!

178
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,348
That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart.
It's time for us to take back our pride!

179
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:53,259
Yeah !

180
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:05,371
Red Power!

181
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:07,498
We gingers are proud people!

182
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:12,570
We are the noble descendants of great Americans
like Ron Howard, and ...others!

183
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,866
We will not be discriminated against any longer,
for we are a great race!

184
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:17,957
Yeah !

185
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:21,978
Red Power!

186
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,193
I don't believe it.

187
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:24,689
Should we tell him the truth?

188
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,492
Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself
for a little while longer.

189
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:28,839
Red power !

190
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,643
Better red than dead!

191
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:36,255
Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center
 For The Performing Arts,

192
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,161
where the new production of "Annie" has
 just premiered to cries of outrage.

193
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:46,715
A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger
 Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie

194
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,430
is being played by a girl who isn't actually
 red-haired and freckled.

195
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,700
Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.

196
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:59,981
That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers
 are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!

197
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:04,364
What harm do you believe this actress is doing 
to the true red-haired community?

198
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,865
The bitch isn't ginger! 
She's just using makeup to look ginger!

199
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,597
And pretending to be ginger with makeup
 is the worst thing anybody can do!

200
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:13,735
Yeah! That's right!

201
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:21,289
There she is! Get her!
Die, you stupid bitch!

202
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:25,110
This is getting pretty ugly, Tom.
 These gingers are really riled up!

203
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:28,364
If you are a ginger and would like
 to join The Ginger Separatist Movement,

204
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,522
you can attend their first meeting this Friday
 in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.

205
00:13:36,826 --> 00:13:38,662
Okay, welcome, everyone.

206
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:43,711
It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout
 at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference!

207
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:51,459
Now it is my honor to introduce the man who 
has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!

208
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:56,050
Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feeln'?

209
00:13:57,894 --> 00:13:59,147
Can I get a Red Power?

210
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:00,354
Red Power!

211
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:02,559
Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it?

212
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:06,725
Feels good to be proud of who you are! 
Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there.

213
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,882
Hate for awesome people like us.

214
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:13,647
And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only
 way to fight hate, is with more hate!

215
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:16,481
We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!

216
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,816
Yeah !!!

217
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:21,216
Gingers are the chosen people! 
The chosen race!

218
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:26,256
And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife,
 dark-skinned rats that they are!

219
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,457
Hello there!
 Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations.

220
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,563
Just making sure you guys have everything you need.

221
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,325
We're fine, thanks.

222
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,935
Need any buffet items restocked? 
Everyone okay on coffee?

223
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,062
We're fine!

224
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:45,510
Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks
 for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference.

225
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,028
You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!!

226
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,752
My fellow gingers! 
I envision a world in which there IS no hate!

227
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:55,010
A world where everyone is ginger!

228
00:14:55,045 --> 00:15:00,910
And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger,
 and exterminate them!

229
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,650
Huh ?

230
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:03,648
Exterminate ?

231
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:08,140
Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids
 from their homes!

232
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:12,497
We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures
 and a pit of lava to thrown them all in!

233
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:17,388
Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority!
 Are you with me?!

234
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,223
Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's
 and change him back into a non-ginger!

235
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,324
Huh? Why?

236
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,302
Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. 
And all his friends are gingers.

237
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:34,523
When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger,
 it'll be hysterical!

238
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:36,625
Are you in?

239
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:38,809
totally

240
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,842
You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole,
 but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers.

241
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,836
I think we all need to realize that everyone is
 different in one way or another,

242
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:50,687
and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences

243
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:54,463
I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that
 gingers were gonna come get me in the night.

244
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,395
Oh... hey there.

245
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,293
You guys... need... anything?

246
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,576
Let's just... let's just walk this way.

247
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,714
More ginger kids.
 Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.

248
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,008
Yeah, good idea.

249
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,941
The hell do they want??

250
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,679
Kenny !

251
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,039
Run dude, run !

252
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,976
Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH!

253
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,825
Clyde? What is it, honey??

254
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,902
Ginger kids! Nooo!

255
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,708
Laaa la, laaa lala.

256
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:09,765
What is it??

257
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,532
It's a... little ginger girl.

258
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,826
Shut the door!

259
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:19,665
Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la.

260
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:36,807
In there! Let's go!

261
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,428
Get this jamb on the door!

262
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,266
Kyle. Kyle, wake up.

263
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:10,490
Huh. Whaaa? Where are we ?

264
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,155
I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.

265
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,253
My fellow gingers! 
The day of reckoning is finally upon us!

266
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,163
Cartman ?

267
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:27,711
Oh Jesus, I should have known!

268
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:34,115
What we begin here, we will take worldwide, 
until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled!

269
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,282
You guys got everything you need in here?
Need more coffee, buffet items?

270
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,089
No, we're fine! Thank you!

271
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,085
How about lava? You got enough lava?

272
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,376
Yes! We're good!

273
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:47,783
Okay. 
Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys.

274
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,584
You're welcome, now leave us alone!!

275
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:54,053
Now! Let the extermination begin!

276
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:58,043
We will start... with the daywalker!

277
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,249
Daywalker !

278
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:04,999
Throw him in !

279
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:06,740
Cartman! I need to tell you something!

280
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,296
Go on then! Say your last words!

281
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,681
Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!

282
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,329
Okay fine, let him speak!

283
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:16,031
Then we kill every non-ginger here!

284
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,291
You... you what?

285
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:35,196
Come on, let's fulfill the plan! 
All non-gingers must die!

286
00:19:38,146 --> 00:19:44,121
Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys!

287
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,254
Uh, I just realized something. 
 We shouldn't be doing this.

288
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,650
Ah I mean, look at us. 
What have we become?

289
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,310
Huh? What?

290
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,336
D-don't you see?

291
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:57,704
If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger,
 then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us.

292
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,912
Maybe we all have to learn to live... together.

293
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:07,338
But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.

294
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,198
Right, but... but I've learned that 
we can't judge people based on what they look like.

295
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:16,199
But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.

296
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:21,044
See I know, I know, but I I get it now. 
We we've got to live and let live.

297
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:26,077
What did that kid in the green hat tell you?

298
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,447
Huh ?

299
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:30,310
That kid right there. 
What did he just tell you?

300
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:35,068
Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... 
Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.

301
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:36,597
You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger,

302
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:39,662
then that kid in the green hat told you something, 
and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden.

303
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,845
What did he tell you?

304
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,837
No, he was just telling me about something
 funny that happened at school yesterday.

305
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,806
Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh!

306
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:50,308
Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels
 to finally love my fellow man, huh?

307
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:56,764
Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been through a lot! 
But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.

308
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,468
Hand in hand, we can live together.
 Ginger or not, we're all the same.

309
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:06,350
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other,
 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!

310
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,460
Hand in hand, we can live together.

311
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:11,140
Ginger or not, it's all the same.

312
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:12,409
That's it! You've got it!

313
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:16,744
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each
 other, 'cause dying's lame

314
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:19,232
Hand in hand, we can live together.

315
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,034
Live together!

316
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,519
We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.

317
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,347
You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman

318
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:26,893
Yes, but I'm not going to die.

319
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,349
That's why we gotta get along, people!

320
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,838
Hand in hand, we can live together. 
We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
