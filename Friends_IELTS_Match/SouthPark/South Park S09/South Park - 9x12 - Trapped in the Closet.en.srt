Episode 9x12
"Trapped In The Closet"

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,300
Oh dude, check it out.
I got a Jake Plummer.

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,300
How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,600
I can't spend any money.
I'm saving up for that bike I want.

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,300
HA! Saving money, duhhh!

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
So what should we do now? It's Saturday,
we have to have as much fun as possible.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,800
Hey, I know!
Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,700
Let's just do something fun that's free.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Stan, don't you know
the first law of physics?

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,300
Anything that's fun costs
at least eight dollars.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,100
Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Well I can't spend any money.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,400
Okay, be a Jew.
We're gonna go play laser tag.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah. See ya.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,300
Hello, would you like to
take a personality test?

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
It's fun and it's free.

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,500
Excuse me?

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
We're doing free personality tests today.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,900
Uh what do I have to do?

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
Have you heard of Scientology?

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,200
It's all based on the book, Dianetics.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,400
A lot of really cool people are Scientologists,

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
like Tom Cruise and John Travolta.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Pourquoi tu n'entres pas?
On pourrait commencer ton test de personnalité.

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Why don't you come on in

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,900
and we'll get your fun free
personality test started.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,100
Hey Brian.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
Hey Kelly. How's it going?

31
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,600
Great! I want you to
meet my new friend, Stan.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
Hey there! How are you?

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Fine.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,100
Brian's gonna give you
your personality test

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,300
and then let you know some
things about Scientology.

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,800
Good times, good times!

37
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,600
L-look, is this a religion?

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
Because my family is like,
Catholic or something.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Ho, that's not a problem at all.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,100
Scientology is more like an alternative
to psychology than a religion.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,800
Then how come that sign says
"Church of Scientology"?

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Oho, that's just this thing:

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
What's the Denver Broncos' record now?
Six and two?

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Seven and two.

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,100
Wow! That's great! All right, come on in
and take a seat, we're gonna have some fun!

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
All right now, I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,700
Just answer these questions as
truthfully as you can, alright?

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Okay. Number 1:

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,700
Do you ever make remarks...
which you later regret?

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,000
Uhhh, sh-sure?

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Uh huh. Would you rather give
orders... than take them?

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,100
Yeah?

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Do you ever whistle...
just for the fun of it.

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,200
Ohhhkay, and finally, does life sometimes
feel vague and confusing to you?

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,600
Okay, Stan. Well, that's it.
That's the end of the personality test.

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,800
So how did I do?

58
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,500
Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
but... you are one messed-up kid.

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,500
Huh?

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely
miserable and totally depressed.

62
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,300
I am? I didn't know that!

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Well there's certainly no question that
you are a perfect candidate for Scientology.

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,500
I think it can really
make you happy again.

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
What what do I do?

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,200
It's very simple. We just need
two hundred and forty dollars.

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Stanley, you haven't touched your
food. What's the matter with you?

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm totally depressed.

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,400
What? Why?

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,100
I don't know.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
Well how long have you
been feeling this way?

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,200
I'm not sure. But...
I need two hundred and forty dollars.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
Two hundred and forty dollars?!
What'd you do, break something?!

74
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,300
No, I found a self-help
program that can cure me.

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,800
Ohhh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,900
But I'm completely miserable
and these people can help!

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,800
Stanley, I didn't know
you were miserable.

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Neither did I!

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Stanley, do you have any
concept of money at all?

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?

81
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
Don't you care that I'm depressed?!

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
What if I become suicidal, or, or
become an alcoholic like Grandpa?

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,900
Well, if you really think
your life is so bad, Stan

84
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,500
why don't you take what you
have out of your bicycle savings?!

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,600
Well but... but that's my money.

86
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Yeah, well just like the rest of us,
you have to make choices with your money.

87
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,400
Do you want a bike, or do
you not want to be depressed?

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,400
Michelle, our friend Stan
wants to have auditing.

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Oho good, you're going to be so happy.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,700
I hope so.

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,700
It's the beginning of a whole new
life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards.

92
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,800
Great, so do you have the
two hundred and forty dollars?

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
Perfect! We're on our way!

94
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Come on over here and I'll fill you

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,100
in on how the Church of
Scientology works.

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
You see, Stan, scientology was founded

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard.

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,200
Mr. Hubbard discovered
that negative emotions

99
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,400
are actually caused by
things called "body thetans."

100
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Really?

101
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes! And being the genius
that he was, Mr. Hubbard

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,700
invented a way to get
rid of those bad thetans.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
This is called an E-meter.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,900
It's the main tool of Scientology.

105
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,200
You just grab a hold of
these handles as

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,500
I talk you through past
experiences in your life.

107
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll be taking readings here

108
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,700
and we'll be able to determine
your thetan levels.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,900
Thetan levels.

110
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,700
Come on in the auditing room
and I'll show you how it works.

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
All these people are just like you,
Stan, auditing with E-meters

112
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,600
to get rid of their negative emotions.

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
All right, Stan,
I want you to just relax

114
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,700
and take hold of the E-meter handles.

115
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,500
So, this is gonna make me happy?

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
Just take a few deep breaths

117
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,800
and I'll just get a base
reading of your thetan levels.

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,500
Hnh, that's, that's strange.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
What?

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Somethin...
something's wrong.

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
Brian, could you come
over here a second?

122
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,200
Yep. Oh hey there, Greg!

123
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,000
Stan.

124
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,100
Will you... look at his thetan levels?

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,000
Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter
this one's obviously broken.

126
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Sorry about this, Greg.

127
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,500
And so we just try to
analyze your personality

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
and if it seems like
you need some help

129
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
then you can have an audit

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,600
counseling for a nominal fee.

131
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay.

132
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Mike, I need to talk to you!

133
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,600
Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back.

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you all right? You're sweating!

135
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,000
Take a look at this.

136
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,700
What is it?

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
The E-meter results from
the little boy in Room D.

138
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,500
This... this can't be right.

139
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,800
We ran the tests four times!

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,100
We used four different E-meters!

141
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,800
Fax these results to the
head office in Los Angeles.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,800
The president has to see thus right away.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
Go! Now!

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,200
The boy is from a small
mountain town in Colorado, sir.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,600
Sir, how can it be that a first timer
scores that kind of thetan level?

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,300
He registered OT9!

147
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm only OT7 and I've been
in the church all my life!

148
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,600
I've waited...
forty-two years... for this day.

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Sir?

150
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,600
Don't you all see what this means?

151
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,200
There was only one person
who EVER registered

152
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,800
OT9 in the history of our church.

153
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,900
L. Ron Hubbard said he
had lived past lives.

154
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,500
That when he died his thetan
would show itself again.

155
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Our prophet has returned.

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Uh, Stanley, take the garbage
out before you go to bed.

157
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,700
I took out the garbage yesterday.

158
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,900
Right now, Stan!

159
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
Stupid dumb garbage!

160
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
There he is!

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you for returning!

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,500
He's wonderful.
He's wonderful.

163
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,400
Stan! What the hell did you do?!

164
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I don't know!

165
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Hello young man.
I'm the head of Scientology.

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,200
It is... a great honor to meet you!

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
All right, what the hell
is going on here?!

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We've been looking for your
son for a long time, Mr. Marsh.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,700
He is the reincarnation of our
church's most famous prophet.

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,200
What?

171
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,100
Scientologists the world over are
simply rejoicing at his second coming.

172
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Look, we don't want our son
to join your group, okay?

173
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,200
We're not asking him to join us

174
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,500
we're asking him... to lead us.

175
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh my God, it's John Travolta!

176
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Is this where he lives? Is this
where L. Ron Hubbart is? Oh my God!

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise
are big Scientologists.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,300
Do you believe me now?

179
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,600
Young man, I know you
don't remember it

180
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard.

181
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,000
You revealed the secret that began
the whole Church of Scientology.

182
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to
your room and get ready for bed!

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
Let Mommy and Daddy handle this.

184
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
Jesus Christ...

185
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
L. Ron?  L. Ron!

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
It really is you!

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!

188
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,900
Aw dude, I need to go to bed.

189
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
Don't you understand, L. Ron?
It's me! Tom Cruise!

190
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Yeah, I know who you are.

191
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron?

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
Haven't you enjoyed my acting?

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,700
Which film did you like best?

194
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,900
Well-h. I mean, you're not like
as good as Leonardo di Caprio,

195
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,000
but you're okay, I guess.

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,400
What?

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
I mean, you're not Gene Hackman

198
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,450
or that guy who played Napoleon
Dynamite, but you're okay.

199
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
] I'm nothing.

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm a failure in the eyes
of the Prophet! Aaah!

201
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,300
Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,400
Go away!

203
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,300
Dude, this is my rooom!

204
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,100
Go away, I said!

205
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
Dad! Tom Cruise won't
come out of the closet!

206
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,200
What?!

207
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,100
Tom Cruise locked himself in
my closet and he won't come out.

208
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,900
Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise,
come out of the closet.

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,300
No!

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
Come on, Mr. Crusie, this is ridiculous.

211
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm never coming out!

212
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,300
What did you say to him?

213
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,600
I just told him I thought the

214
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
Napoleon Dynamite guy is
a better actor than he is.

215
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,800
Oh boy.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,300
Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay
in the closet, alright?

217
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
You need to come out.

218
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,400
What's going on?

219
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.

220
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,600
What?

221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,100
Just leave me alone!

222
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,800
Well, we CAN'T leave you alone

223
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
because YOU won't come out of the closet!

224
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
It's been four hours now

225
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,900
and Tom Cruise still will
not come out of the closet.

226
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,700
Hundreds of onlookers
here have gathered here in

227
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,000
hopes that the celebrity
will finally give in.

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,100
Tom Cruise, this is Park County police!

229
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,800
Please come out of the closet.

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,500
Everybody here just wants you
to come out of the closet, Tom.

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,900
Nobody's gonna be mad,
everything's gonna be all right.

232
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Just come out of the closet.

233
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,700
We're still not exactly sure
why Tom Cruise is in the closet

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,300
but I'm being joined now by
famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly.

235
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
<i>Well I was just standing here</i>

236
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,000
<i>and Tom Cruise locked
himself in the closet.</i>

237
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
<i>I asked myself why won't Tom
Cruise just come out the closet?</i>

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,900
<i>Nobody has no answers</i>

239
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,300
<i>and so I pull out my gun!</i>

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,100
<i>Tell my why Tom Cruise in the closet</i>

241
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,000
<i>or else I'm gonna shoot someone!</i>

242
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Please, understand we just want

243
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
what is best for your son.

244
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,100
The reincarnation of L. Ron
Hubbard must be taken care of.

245
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,700
He had many enemies.

246
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard
a science-fiction writer?

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,100
Yes. But he was also a prophet...

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
who knew the secret truth
about the nature of life.

249
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,300
This is just too much.

250
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,500
We want to reveal to Stan the great
secret of life behind our church.

251
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine.

252
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Please, your son deserves to be enlightened.

253
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Stan, do you want to hear
the great secret

254
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,200
doctrine of life behind Scientology?

255
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,700
Sure.

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
All right, go ahead and tell him.

257
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
Would you excuse us, please?

258
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
This is highly-classified
church information.

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
Aw rats.

260
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
Usually, to hear the secret doctrine

261
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,000
you have to be in the church
for several years, Stan.

262
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,100
Are you ready to hear the truth?

263
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
I guess.

264
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,200
You see, Stan, there is a reason

265
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
for people feeling sad and depressed.

266
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,100
An alien reason.

267
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,800
It all began 75 million years ago.

268
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,200
Back then there was a galactinc
federation of planets

269
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,100
which was ruled over
by the evil Lord Xenu.

270
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,700
Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated

271
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,200
and so he rounded up countless aliens
from all different planets

272
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,300
and then had those aliens frozen.

273
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,300
<i>Les Scientologues croient
vraiment à ça.</i>

274
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
The frozen alien bodies were loaded
onto Xenu's galactic cruisers

275
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
which looked like DC-8s,
except with rocket engines.

276
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
The cruisers then took the frozen
alien bodies to our planet

277
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,900
to Earth

278
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,400
and dumped them into
the volcanoes of Hawaii.

279
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,600
The aliens were no longer frozen,
they were dead.

280
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,900
The souls of those aliens,
however, lived on

281
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,800
and all floated up towards the sky.

282
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,800
But the evil Lord Xenu
had prepared for this.

283
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Xenu didn't want their souls to return!

284
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,400
And so he built giant
soul-catchers in the sky!

285
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,500
The souls were taken to a huge
soul brain-washing facility

286
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,300
which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth.

287
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
There the souls were forced to watch
days of brainwashing material

288
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,200
whiched tricked them into
believing a false reality.

289
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,600
Xenu then released the alien souls

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
which roamed the earth aimlessly
in a fog of confusion.

291
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,700
At the dawn of man

292
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,600
the souls finally found bodies
which they can grab onto.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,200
They attached themselves to all mankind

294
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,600
which still to this day
causes all our fears

295
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,200
our confusions and our problems.

296
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing thing

297
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,500
telling the world this
incredible truth.

298
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,900
Now all we're asking you to do...

299
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,600
is pick up where he left off.

300
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
But I don't know any of this stuff.

301
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,000
Neither did L. Ron when he started.

302
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,700
He said he just closed his eyes

303
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
and wrote down whatever came to mind.

304
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,100
You can do the same.

305
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Just let it flow.

306
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, I'll try.

307
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
I just wish I could write in my room

308
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,100
but Tom Cruise won't
come out of the closet.

309
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,200
I know. We've send Nicole Kidman
up there to see if she can help.

310
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
Tom? Tom, It's Nicole.

311
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,900
Ah hi Nicole.

312
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,600
Tom, don't you think this
has gone on long enough?

313
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,100
It's time for you to come
out of the closet.

314
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not, I'm not in the closet.

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Yes you are, Tom.

316
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,700
And you need to just end
this and come out.

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm not gonna think any
differently of you.

318
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,700
Kate's not gonna think
any differently of you.

319
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,200
You don't need to be in
that closet anymore, Tom.

320
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm not in here, though.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,100
Yes, you are.

322
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet.

323
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,700
Then how am I talking to you, Tom?

324
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Tom, you can't hide
forever just because

325
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,400
the reincarnation of L. Ron
Hubbard doesn't like your acting.

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Come out of the closet, Tom.

327
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,300
You're not fooling anyone.

328
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,100
I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here.

329
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.

330
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,900
I can't. I'm writing a new
sacred doctrine for my church.

331
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,500
Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned
about this cult that you're getting into.

332
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle.

333
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,900
I've read all this stuff
and it's based on fact.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was
a science-fiction writer.

335
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
He lived on a boat with only young boys

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,100
and got busted by the
feds numerous times.

337
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,200
I did not!

338
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Those are rumors put out by people

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,600
who are afraid because they
don't know the secret truth.

340
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
What secret truth?

341
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
I can't tell you unless you pay
for a few years of audit counseling!

342
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
All I know is that I was depressed before

343
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,200
and now I found meaning!

344
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
I didn't know you were depressed.

345
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,300
Neither did I!

346
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,000
But now, if you guys can't accept

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,300
this great thing I belong to

348
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,900
then I suppose we're
no longer friends!

349
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,500
Stan, I just want you to know

350
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,400
that I still hate Kyle more than you.

351
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,100
Tom! Hey Tom, this is John Travolta.

352
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,100
Oh hey John.

353
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,500
Tom, you've gotta come out
of the closet. Oh my Gahd.

354
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think
I'm a great actor.

355
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Mm-maybe you took what
he said out of context.

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,700
Okay, 's like, if you don't come out

357
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,700
can I at least come in and talk to you?

358
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Oh... Okay, but no tricks.

359
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,400
No tricks.

360
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,900
Hey, it's really nice n here.

361
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,600
Yeah, see?

362
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
I feel really safe.
Oh my Gahd.

363
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
Hello? Hey, come out of there!

364
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
Tom, it now appears that John Travolta

365
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
is also in the closet
and he refuses to come out.

366
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Here with more details
once again, is R. Kelly.

367
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,000
<i>I was just standing here.</i>

368
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,100
<i>Tom Cruise locked himself
in the closet.</i>

369
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>Then John Travolta come</i>

370
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
<i>and now, John Travolta
in the closet too.</i>

371
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,800
<i>Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta
come out the closet!</i>

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,400
<i>But then I calm myself down
and I pull out my gun!</i>

373
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,600
Oh geez, here we go with the gun again.

374
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
<i>If Tom Cruise and John Travolta
don't come out the closet</i>

375
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>I'm gonna cap this biiitch!</i>

376
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan!

377
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,600
I wrote that um, our followers
shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore

378
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,800
because they're too much
like Xenu's evil cruisers.

379
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,500
Yes, of course! So wonderful!

380
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,400
And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu

381
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,900
was recently broken
out of galactic jail.

382
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Yes, of course!

383
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
And best of all, I wrote that
all the Scientologists

384
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
should no longer have to
pay money to belong.

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,300
What?

386
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,100
I realize that to really be a church

387
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,900
we can't charge people for help.

388
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
What are you, stupid?!

389
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,400
Then how do we make money
from those people?!

390
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,300
Well, it's not about the money,
it's about the message, right?

391
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,700
Waait a minute, whoa, whoa!

392
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,400
You don't actually believe
this crap, do you?

393
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,100
Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?

394
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,800
E-meters and thetan levels?

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
Those people out there buy that crap

396
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,700
and I thought YOU were smart enough
to see what was really going on!

397
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,000
But you said that there were...

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,700
What's better than telling
people a stupid story

399
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
and having them believe you?!

400
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Having them PAY you for it, stupid!

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,300
But then, why me?

402
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Why do you need me to write
something so badly?

403
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,900
Because if those people all think you're
the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard

404
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,500
then they'll all buy your new writings

405
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
and you and I together will
make three million dollars!

406
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
Three milliion dollars?

407
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,000
That's how the scam works!

408
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
But this is a scam on a global scale!

409
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,100
Do you fucking get me now?!

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Yeah. Yeah, I get you.

411
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,600
Then keep writing, L. Ron!
Your people are waiting.

412
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,600
Breaking news here in South Park.

413
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,400
Tom Cruise and John Travolta still...
will not come out of the closet.

414
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Park County police have
decided to try a new method.

415
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
<i>I've been asked to come up here</i>

416
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
<i>get you both out of the closet.</i>

417
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
<i>Man, this is some crazy shit.</i>

418
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,200
<i>Why won't you both just come out
the closet? And they said...</i>

419
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,300
<i>We're not comin' out the closet</i>

420
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>so you can just go away.</i>

421
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,800
<i>But everyone wants you
out the closet.</i>

422
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,300
<i>That doesn't matter '
cause we're gonna stay.</i>

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
<i>Now I'm startin' to get angry</i>

424
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,900
<i>so I pull out my gun!</i>

425
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,900
<i>I'm gonna give you a count of
three to open this closet door.</i>

426
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,900
<i>1. I'm gonna shoot you both.</i>

427
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
<i>2. I'm gonna cap some bitch.</i>

428
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>3...</i>

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,800
<i>Now I'm in the closet.</i>

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,900
<i>Now I'm in the closet too.</i>

431
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
My fellow Scientologists!

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,900
Our prophet has finished his new doctrine

433
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
and will now read some
passages before making

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
it available to you all
for a nominal fee.

435
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,400
I give you...
the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard!

436
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Uh, thanks.

437
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,300
So, first of all, I've written
that the brainwashed alien ghosts

438
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,700
are actually from a
galaxy called Nubanon.

439
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Ohhhh.

440
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
And uh, oh, I... I can't do this.

441
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Huh, what?

442
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,000
Look, everybody, we're all
looking for answer, you know.

443
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,900
We all want to understand who
we are and where we come from

444
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,200
but... sometimes we want to know
the answers so badly that we...

445
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
believe just about anything.

446
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
- Huh?
- What?

447
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
I'm not the reincarnation
of L. Ron Hubbard.

448
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,300
And... Scientology is just
a big fat global scam.

449
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,400
Oh! We are gonna sue you!

450
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,900
What?

451
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah, you think you can say
our religion is a lie?!

452
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,900
We'll sue you, buddy!

453
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
YOU told me it was a lie!

454
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,100
Ho, now you're puttin'
words in MY mouth!

455
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,000
You are sooo sued!

456
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,300
You can't make fun of Scientology, kid!

457
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,800
We are gonna sue your ass
and your balls!

458
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
Yeah, that's right!

459
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,000
How dare you mock our faith,
you little punk?!

460
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,300
You'll be hearing from
our lawyers tomorrow!

461
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,900
We've just had an incredible
development here, Mitch.

462
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,600
Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly
have all come out of the closet!

463
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
So you're NOT the prophet, huh?!

464
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,300
You made me look stupid!
I'm gonna sue you too!

465
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!

466
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
I will! I'll sue you in England!

467
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,300
You are so sued, kid!

468
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Well go on, then! Sue me!

469
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,600
We're going to!

470
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,700
Okay, good! Do it!
I'm not scared of you!

471
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,600
Sue me!
