00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:33,305
Episode 9x13
"Free Willzyx"

2
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:38,170
And now, Jambu is going to
going to give you all a big wave!

3
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,872
I'm all wet! Sweet!

4
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,380
Dude, Jambu is the best!

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,602
Now get ready for Jambu's next trick.

6
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,882
Haha! I'm totally wet!
This is awesome!

7
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:56,885
How about that, folks!
A full body flip!

8
00:00:56,885 --> 00:01:00,889
And now, Kelly's gonna show us
how she makes Jambu do his tricks.

9
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:04,852
When Kelly slaps her hand three times,
Jambu comes to her.

10
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:10,858
Jambu will stay and wait until
Kelly gives him a command.

11
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:16,864
Oh, what trick are we gonna see?
Get those cameras ready!

12
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:20,868
That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose!

13
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:26,874
I wish Kelly would ride on my nose.

14
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:28,781
Yes! Yeehehehes!

15
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:35,550
We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show and enjoy
the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park!

16
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:38,973
You bunch of retards.
- Hehe. Yeah.

17
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:41,889
Okay, where to next?

18
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,291
I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.

19
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,537
Let's just stay here and watch the
whale swim around some more.

20
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,853
Why?

21
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,855
Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk
right up to the tank and really study him.

22
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:51,857
Kyle, the show is over!

23
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,859
The whale isn't gonna splash
us any more, so who cares?

24
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,862
Let's go see the stingrays and
then we can go to the sea lion show.

25
00:01:56,862 --> 00:01:57,863
Killer.

26
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:59,865
I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit.
I-I wanna hang out here some more.

27
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:02,330
Okay, Kyle. We're gonna
get splashed some more

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,972
but if you wanna go make
love to the whale, that's fine.

29
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:16,382
Jambu! Jambu!

30
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:17,983
Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.

31
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:22,888
Hello, little boy.

32
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:24,890
You like my flippers?

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,850
Who said that?

34
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,852
I did.

35
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,854
No way!

36
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:34,858
This is very exciting!
Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me.

37
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,861
Where are you from?

38
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,862
South Park.

39
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:41,865
It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to.

40
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:43,867
Can't we talk more? Please?

41
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,869
What do you wanna talk about?

42
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:47,871
Let's talk about rocket ships.

43
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,873
Rocket ships?

44
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:58,882
Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see
them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank.

45
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:04,888
You know, someday, I wish that I
could go up in space in a rocket ship.

46
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,890
Why? Aren't you happy here?

47
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,855
I try to be, but my dream is to
oneday blast off in a big rocket ship!

48
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:19,862
This is amazing! But wait right here.
I've gotta go tell my friends about this!

49
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:23,866
Oh God, it's funny every single time.

50
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,869
And for those of you just joining us,
this is the stingray tank.

51
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:31,874
Stingrays are members of the shark family,
but they're extremely peaceful creatures.

52
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:35,878
We invite you to gently touch
the top of them as they swim by.

53
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,880
Heh! Come on, stingray!

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,882
Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me!

55
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,884
Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!

56
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,886
Hey you guys! You guys
are not gonna believe this!

57
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:44,887
What?

58
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:45,888
Dude, he talks!

59
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:47,890
The orca whale talks!

60
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,850
(What the fuck are you talking about?)

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,853
I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped
three times like the trainer did.

62
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:56,857
Jambu swam up and started
talking to me about rocket ships!

63
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,859
Come on! You gotta check it out!

64
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:09,870
Jambu! Jambu, I'm back!

65
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,877
How are you feeling?

66
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:27,888
Huhm. Jambu, you wanna
talk about rocket ships?

67
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,849
Ja- Jambu?
Are you still feelin' lonely here?

68
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,852
Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.

69
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:36,855
He talked! I swear to Abraham he
talked and he loves rocket ships!

70
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,858
Dude, he's back, he's back!

71
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,860
Goddamnit, say something!

72
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,862
Come on, guys, let's leave
Kyle with his stupid whale.

73
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,865
Please don't call me stupid.

74
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:49,868
Jambu! Jambu, why didn't
you speak up before?

75
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,871
I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk.

76
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,874
It's because I'm very very sick, you see.

77
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,876
Sick?

78
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:58,877
I don't believe it.

79
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:01,880
Yes, because I'm not used
to the earth atmosphere.

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,887
You see, my name is actually Willzyx
and I'm from the moon!

81
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:10,889
The moon?

82
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,851
The... that's where all orca whales are from.

83
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:18,856
If I don't get back to
the moon, I'm going to die.

84
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:20,858
You live on the moon?

85
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:21,859
I used to.

86
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:27,865
I wish I could return and dance in the moon
castle with my wife and three children again.

87
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,867
Oh my God...

88
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,870
Why don't you just tell the
people here at the sea park?

89
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,575
I can't tell them, because they're evil
communists from the Horsehead Nebula.

90
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:43,881
They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep
us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.

91
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,883
That's terrible!

92
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:47,885
Dude, the boss is coming!

93
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:52,890
Uh, uh, sorry boys,
I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick.

94
00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:01,857
Can't. Talk. Any. More.

95
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:03,859
Alright guys, listen up!

96
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,861
This may sound a little strange, but

97
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:12,868
the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is
going to die, unless we get it to the moon

98
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:14,870
Well okay! Let's do it!

99
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,874
The whale's name is Willzy-x and
he told us he's dying on our planet.

100
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:23,879
We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna
need all of your help to make it work.

101
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,881
...A whale. Talked to you.

102
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:29,885
It's true. The whale talked to all of us.
In between shows at his orca tank.

103
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,887
Hey, that whale talked to me too.

104
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:35,849
After everyone left the show I walked up
to the glass and he started talking.

105
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,851
Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
- Well I thought I was crazy.

106
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,856
He said my dad was gonna sneak into
my room naked one night and beat me up.

107
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:44,858
Well you're NOT crazy.
The whale talked to all of us.

108
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:46,860
And he needs our help getting him home.

109
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,861
...So it's true.

110
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:49,863
Nobody else is going to help him, you guys.

111
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:53,867
We've got a chance to do something
pretty special here. Are you with us?

112
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,868
...What do we do?

113
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,070
Stan?

114
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,950
All right. In order to make our plan work.

115
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,874
We're going to need the pool from
Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair,

116
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:14,888
the Russian government and all of our skateboards.

117
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:23,856
Timmy...

118
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:30,863
Craig, Token, get the slings ready.

119
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,865
Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything.

120
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:39,872
We're gonna bust you out of here.

121
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:42,875
Dude, did you see that episode of Trading
Spouses last night? That was insane

122
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,876
Yeah, well ha- whoa.

123
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:47,880
What the hell?

124
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,884
How could you not have seen anything?
It's a whale, for Christ's sake!

125
00:07:51,884 --> 00:07:54,887
It must have been taken while
I was going to the bathroom.

126
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,889
Were you in there for three hours?!?

127
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,891
Don't yell at me!

128
00:07:58,891 --> 00:07:59,850
What happened?

129
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,852
Somebody kidnapped Jambu,
took him right out of the park.

130
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,854
What? How?

131
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:05,856
I DON'T KNOW!

132
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:09,860
All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing
with a highly intelligent animal-rights group.

133
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,862
Those bastards have done
stuff like this before.

134
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,864
Sir! Sir, we've found a note!

135
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:15,866
A note? Let me see that.

136
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,870
We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon

137
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,874
Long live the zypods!

138
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,876
What the hell does that mean?

139
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,878
Harris, run a fingerprint on that note!

140
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,880
Nelson! Find out what kind of
crayon it was written with.

141
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,885
We'll find out who was responsible for this!

142
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,888
We have to tell them!
We know what those boys look like!

143
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:40,849
We can't tell them, then they're,
they're gonna think this is all our fault.

144
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:41,850
It IS all our fault!

145
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,853
How were we supposed to know
that they were gonna actually do it?!

146
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:47,856
I shouldn't have laughed. All those times
we've messed with those kids' heads

147
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,858
I should have just laughed there and laughed.

148
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:50,859
Don't you say that! It was funny!

149
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,861
It was really funny!

150
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,864
We've just... we've just gotta
make this right ourselves.

151
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:56,665
How?
- We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!

152
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,964
We've gotta track down those kids.
Before the police do!

153
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:07,876
Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire.

154
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:09,878
The economy is stale and I...

155
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:14,883
Very soon, Mother Russia...
will no longer be a country.

156
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:16,885
Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone!

157
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:22,850
Another rich American
wants to fly into space!

158
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,854
Hello?
Hello, this is Russian President.

159
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:30,858
Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your
country flies people into space for money.

160
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:32,860
Yes, we certainly do!

161
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,865
What were you looking for?
- I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.

162
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:41,869
The moon. That is quite large trip,
but I'm sure we can do it!

163
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,871
You can? Awesome!

164
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,873
It sounds like we're in business!

165
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:50,878
We will just need, say,
twenty million dollars?

166
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:55,883
Twenty... million? Are you nuts?
We don't have that kind of money.

167
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:56,884
...What?

168
00:09:56,884 --> 00:10:01,889
But you need to understand: we have a whale here
that needs to get back to his family on the moon.

169
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:04,850
Goddamnit it is prank call again!

170
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,854
Kiss my ass, George Bush!
This is not funny!

171
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:10,856
What happened?
- They want twenty million dollars.

172
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:13,859
Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?

173
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,861
To wszystko?
To by³ ten wasz plan!?

174
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,863
That was it? That was you guys' whole plan?
Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?

175
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,865
They were going to do
it for that 'N Sync guy.

176
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,867
Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!

177
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,870
All right, look, there's gotta be other
Third-World countries with space programs.

178
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,873
We've gotta split up and
find someplace cheaper, that's all.

179
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:31,877
Well we can't keep the whale out here
anymore, people are gonna see it!

180
00:10:31,877 --> 00:10:35,881
A beloved performing orca whale has
been stolen from the Denver Sea Park.

181
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,474
A full investigation is underway

182
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:42,888
but tracking down the kidnappers is
proving to be one WHALE of a problem.

183
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,890
Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the
Denver Sea Park where

184
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:50,854
believe it or not, dozens of people have come
to show support for whoever took the whale.

185
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:54,858
That's right. We are members
of the Animal Liberation Front!

186
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:57,861
Whales do not belong in tanks,
they belong in the ocean!

187
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,863
We applaud whoever did this noble deed!

188
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:03,867
Set the whales free!
- Set the whales free!

189
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:08,872
One thing for certain: something is
certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?

190
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:15,879
Thank, Mitch. It seems that this
problem is almost unBEARable.

191
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:19,883
Let's hope that whale is found.

192
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:22,886
This is so bad, man. How do we even
know this is the right town to look in?

193
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,889
Will you relax? Those kids said
they were from South Park.

194
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:28,851
We've just gotta go door to door.
Do you have the composite sketch we did?

195
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:31,854
Yeah.
- Let's go!

196
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,856
Maybe you should start with the
houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-

197
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:36,859
Wait a minute. Check that out!

198
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:39,862
Come on!

199
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:40,863
Oh my good, look!

200
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,865
Whale poo.

201
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,867
We're close. We're really close!

202
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,869
Can I help you?

203
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:50,873
Oh... h-hello ma'am.
We're just here to examine your pool.

204
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,877
Have you noticed any
whales in your pool at all?

205
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:55,878
No, I don't believe so.

206
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:59,882
But we've been out of town for a couple of
days and came back to find the fence broken.

207
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,884
Do you think somebody's been using it?

208
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:11,052
Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys?

209
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,054
The fat one in the middle...

210
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:16,857
kinda looks like Dakota Fanning.

211
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:18,859
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I have to get back to the oven.

212
00:12:18,859 --> 00:12:21,862
We're too late.
They've moved on to another town!

213
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:22,863
We don't know that!

214
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,865
If they've moved on, then we have no leads!

215
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:26,867
This is fate, Brian! It's fate!

216
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,870
For telling the kids their naked
dads were gonna beat them up!

217
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,872
For thinking that screwing
with kids was funny!

218
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,874
It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob!

219
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,876
And it will be funny again, I swear to you!

220
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:38,879
If those boys took the whale out of here,
we would have seen them on the road!

221
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,885
I'm telling you, we're close.
It's going to be funny!

222
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:48,889
Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the
new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?

223
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,849
I can't, Mom. We're
working on our school project.

224
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:54,853
All right. Well, there's pizza in the
fridge if you and your friends get hungry.

225
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:56,855
Okay ma, thanks!

226
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:57,856
Shouldn't we get him back in the water?

227
00:12:57,856 --> 00:12:59,858
Whales are mammals: they don't
need water to breathe, dumbass.

228
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah, we just have to keep him wet.

229
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,864
Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama
with the Japanese space program?

230
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:08,867
How much to take a whale into space?

231
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:12,871
Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale,
we want you to send it to the moon.

232
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:15,874
How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.

233
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:18,877
Hello? Jimmy, any luck
at the Chinese Embassy?

234
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:22,881
The Ch-Chinese will take someone
to space for t-t-ten million dollars.

235
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:25,884
Ten million? Well that's more
than the Germans want!

236
00:13:25,884 --> 00:13:29,888
Yeah. We told them that a-and
they told us to go f-fuck ourselves.

237
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,890
Damnit! Tell me what to do, Willzyx!

238
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,851
How do we get you home?

239
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,853
He hasn't said a word
since we brought him here.

240
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,856
Yeah... He must be really sick.

241
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,858
Hang on Willzyx. There's still hope.

242
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:44,862
Stan and Craig might still luck with
the space program down in Mexico.

243
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:54,872
Mexico has a space program?

244
00:13:54,872 --> 00:14:01,879
Uh, excuse me, we're looking for the Mexican
Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?

245
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:06,884
Allá.
- Thanks.

246
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,886
Is this the Mexican space program?

247
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,888
Space, sí. Fly.

248
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:14,053
Does the Mexican space programs
have rockets that can go to the moon?

249
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,978
Flow, sí, sumi.

250
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:19,801
The roque lunar?

251
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:22,858
This rocket will fly to the moon?

252
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,860
Sí, fly.

253
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,863
To the moon?
- Sí.

254
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:31,867
We want to take something to the moon.
How much would that cost?

255
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:33,869
Two hundred.

256
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,871
Two hundred? Million?

257
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,873
Two hundred... dollars.

258
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:43,879
Quick, call Kyle.

259
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,881
Eh hello ma'am.

260
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:52,888
The teacher at the school said she
recognized this boy to be your son?

261
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:56,850
Oh yes, that's my bubbe.
Kind of a bad drawing though.

262
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,853
Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please!
It's very urgent!

263
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:02,856
I'm sorry, he just left.
He's on his way to Mexico.

264
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:03,857
Mexico?

265
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:06,201
Yehhs. As part of a school project

266
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:11,865
he's helping his class to move two donated grand
pianos to needy school children in Tijuana.

267
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,867
My little bubbe is very caring.

268
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:17,871
Oh my God.
- Which highway did they take?

269
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:20,874
Hurry it up, dude,
we have a rocket to catch.

270
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:27,881
Hang on, Willzy-x.
Hang on, buddy.

271
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:29,883
We have to hurry!

272
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:32,886
I'm going as fast as I can.

273
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,889
Hang on, Willzyx.
We'll in Mexico soon!

274
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,854
Oh hamburgers! What is that?

275
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,856
All right, out of the truck!

276
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,858
Uh oh.
- What the hell is goin' on?!

277
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,860
You're carrying a stolen whale!

278
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,861
Stolen?

279
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:51,864
You kids told me you
won that whale at Pizza Hut!

280
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,867
We're busted.

281
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:55,868
Come on out, kid.

282
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,870
Look, I didn't know nothin' about this.

283
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,873
Just help us get the whale into our truck
and we'll all keep quiet about this.

284
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:03,876
You don't understand!
Willzyx is from the moon!

285
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,878
He'll die if we don't get him back, now!

286
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:09,882
Willzyx, you have to talk!
Come on boy, you have to!

287
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,884
I know you're sick, but you could do it!

288
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:16,889
Look, kid, we need to
tell you a little secret.

289
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,891
What's goin' on here?

290
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:19,850
Aw crap.

291
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,852
Oh, now we're gonna get it.

292
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:23,854
Hey... That's the stolen whale!

293
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,856
Everyone down on the ground. Now!

294
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,858
No! Please, we have to go!

295
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:29,860
You're not goin' anywhere!
You're in a lot of trouble!

296
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,863
But... we were so close...

297
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:34,865
I'm sorry, Willzyx. We tried.

298
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:39,870
We said down on the ground, kid. Move it!

299
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,872
Leave those kids alone, you bastards!

300
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:44,875
Animal Liberation Front!

301
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,877
Put down that weapon, now!

302
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:49,880
These boys are trying to get that
whale home! You're not gonna stop them!

303
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,883
All right!

304
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,885
That whale belongs to a sea park!

305
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:56,887
It belongs with its family!

306
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:57,888
That's right!

307
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,890
I said drop the gun NOW!

308
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,854
Save the whales!

309
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,858
Jesus, Oh God!

310
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,861
Save the whales, motherfucker!

311
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:14,863
Where are you taking the whale?

312
00:17:14,863 --> 00:17:15,864
Tijuana, Mexico!

313
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,866
Of course. Brilliant!

314
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:21,870
Release it in international waters.
I'll drive the truck.

315
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,875
You're going home, Willzyx!

316
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,879
Mike? Mike?!

317
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,882
It... wasn't... funny...

318
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:37,886
Don't say that, Mike. It was funny.

319
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,888
It just wasn't that funny this time.

320
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,850
All the other times were still funny, Mike!

321
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,852
They were still funny!

322
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,854
Forty-five to dispatch...

323
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:49,857
Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana...

324
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:57,865
Whaaale to Tijuana!

325
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:59,867
They're on their way, Manuel.
Is the rocket gonna be ready?

326
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:03,871
Sí, fly.

327
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,873
Look! The Mexican border!

328
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,875
Oh Jesus, they're here!

329
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,879
Hold your positions!

330
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,881
Aha! We've got them!

331
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:17,885
Hang on, boys.

332
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:23,891
Mary Mother of God!

333
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:28,854
Get them!

334
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,856
Willzyx, I think we're here.

335
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:32,858
Back down the ramp!
It's all rigged to go!

336
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:37,663
You got it, kid!

337
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:41,867
Don't let them get that whale in the water!

338
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,870
Kyle, it's all set to go!
Just get Willzyx into the water!

339
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,872
Come on, guys!

340
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,874
Stop right now!

341
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:55,881
Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them!

342
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,885
Hang on. Hold on a second.

343
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:05,849
I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzyx.

344
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:12,856
I'm gonna miss you.

345
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:15,859
Hey, don't forget me, okay?

346
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:21,865
I won't forget you.

347
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:24,868
Oh crap! There's more of them!

348
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:27,871
Get him in the water!

349
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,875
Goodbye, Willzyx!

350
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,878
Swim, mighty whale! You're free!

351
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:37,381
Okay, Manuel, hit it.

352
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,883
Stop! That is my whale!

353
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:42,886
I'm afraid you're too late!
The whale's been set free.

354
00:19:42,886 --> 00:19:43,887
No!

355
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:48,851
Now you see that your ways of captivity
and exploiting animals will never prevail.

356
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:55,858
Not as long as there are children like these who
still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom.

357
00:19:55,858 --> 00:20:00,188
For it is children, with their
innocence and their spirit

358
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:04,479
who know what is truly
best for all the world.

359
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,882
Oh my God!

360
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:37,858
We did it!

361
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,132
Thanks for the ride, Manuel.

362
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:40,714
Sí, bye.

363
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:44,665
Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta
get home before my parents wake up.

364
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:45,555
Yeah, me too.

365
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,370
All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.

366
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,880
Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy,
but... we did a really amazing thing.

367
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,781
Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.

368
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,784
I wonder... if he'll ever
come back and visit us.

369
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:04,825
I don't know.

370
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,485
But at least from now on,
every time we look at the moon

371
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,390
we can know that Willzy-x is up there,
dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
