4
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,027
Children, children, we have
a very special announcement.

5
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:46,060
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning
the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!

6
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,461
Well let's give him a hand!

7
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:49,930
Token sings?

8
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:51,708
Of course he sings. He's black.

9
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:56,876
Token is going to sing in front of a huge
audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.

10
00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,027
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.

11
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,635
Two hundred dollars.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,786
Now of course, as a woman,
I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants,

13
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,263
but I hope that you children take a moment today
to congratulate Token for being so special.

14
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:18,979
Wow, two hundred dollars.

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,785
Can you imagine?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,919
How come we never get opportunities like that?

17
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:23,309
You wanna know what it is, guys?

18
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,374
We're not talented?

19
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:26,014
That's right. We're not talented.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,704
See, we're not the artistic side,
we're the thinking side.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,893
Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.

22
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,442
Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea.

23
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,602
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.

24
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,169
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?

25
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:43,517
We can be Token's agents. That way,
we get ten percent of whatever he makes!

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,354
Hey yeah! We deserve that money
just as much as he does.

27
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,935
We just need a really kickass office
and some nice suits.

28
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:50,440
A and a fountain in our lobby.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,194
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.

30
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:56,840
We gotta make Token think he needs us,
when actually he doesn't need us at all.

31
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:18,971
*Super Awesome Talent Agency*
Are You Talented and Need Representation?

32
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,057
STOP BY OUR OFFICES AT:
345 ave de las Mexicano

33
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,754
He's looking at the sign.

34
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:34,360
Perfect!

35
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:36,792
All right, you guys get back to the office,
I'll bring Token there.

36
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,330
All right.

37
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,005
Wait a minute!

38
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:41,006
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office,

39
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,701
have Kenny hide in another room,
and call the phone on my desk.

40
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:44,221
Why?

41
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:47,505
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking
to somebody super famous and important.

42
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,479
When Token sees that,
maybe he'll think we're legit.

43
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,341
It's genius.

44
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:51,649
Okay, go go, here he comes.

45
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,763
Well then tell him we're just not interested.

46
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,133
Oh hey, Token!

47
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:58,148
Buddy, my man, what is up?!

48
00:02:58,365 --> 00:02:58,871
Nothin.

49
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:01,407
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some
thing down in Denver tomorrow night.

50
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:01,945
Yeah.

51
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:06,476
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before,
but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.

52
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,985
You may have seen our ads around town.

53
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,875
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.

54
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,986
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.

55
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,340
This will only take a second.

56
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,092
Welcome to our offices, Token.

57
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:23,758
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.

58
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,549
Did you notice the fountain?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,698
Pretty nice, hm?

60
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,197
Come on over this way, Token.

61
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,011
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.

62
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,178
Token. Right, yeah, you're
makin' a smart move, man.

63
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:38,133
Now, Token, I I know what
you're saying to yourself:

64
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:40,876
You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency?

65
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,405
Why should I give them ten percent?"

66
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,290
Right?

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,610
...Yeah?

68
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:49,091
Token, the truth is that without representation,
you're in danger of being taken advantage of.

69
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:51,340
Excuse me just a second, Token.

70
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,127
Super Awesome Talent Agency.

71
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,675
Oh yes, hello!

72
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,404
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?

73
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,470
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.

74
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:02,962
Can I talk to you?!

75
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:04,629
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.

76
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,346
What the hell are you doing?!

77
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,136
I'm making it look like important people call us.

78
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:11,176
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,896
...well Token doesn't know that.

80
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:15,847
Yes he does!

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,402
How?!

82
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:19,288
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!

83
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:19,949
Jew!

84
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,381
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.

85
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,094
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.

86
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:29,166
Ah, now, where were we?

87
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,330
We were at why I should give you ten percent.

88
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,236
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.

89
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,796
You're gonna start having a lot of offers
comin' at you from all directions.

90
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:38,922
A media storm is about to hit you
and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.

91
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:42,000
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.

92
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,824
You need somebody to manage it all for you.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,717
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.

94
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,586
With our support, you can have the whole pie.

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,644
Well, I guess that makes sense.

96
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:51,093
All right.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,195
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?

98
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,979
Welcome to the team, Token.

99
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,457
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!

100
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,781
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.

101
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:10,354
You just do all the singing, all the performing
all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.

102
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,744
The Miss Colorado Pageant

103
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:23,015
And there are your finalists,
the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado.

104
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,979
Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists,
the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest,

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,146
Token Black.

106
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,822
You'll never find...

107
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,687
As long as you live...

108
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,400
Someone who loves you...

109
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,407
Tender like I do...

110
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,477
Wow, he's really great.

111
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,022
We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah

112
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,198
Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?

113
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,973
We represent Token.
Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.

114
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:04,887
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby
But I'm the one who loves you

115
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,216
And there's no one else!

116
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:15,439
Just between us girls, nothin'
gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.

117
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,651
Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,938
You were awesome, Token!

119
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,287
We knew you could do it!

120
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,308
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!

121
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,367
And ten percent of two hundred is...

122
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:32,437
Twenty dollars.

123
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,371
Here you go.

124
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:34,940
- All right!
- Sweet!

125
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:38,524
This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see
all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.

126
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,548
Hey there my man,
that was a great performance.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,434
Thanks.

128
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,155
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles.

129
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:48,481
I think you've got real promise.
How'd you like to sign with CAA?

130
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:49,876
Are you serious??

131
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:52,391
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.

132
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,400
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.

133
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,524
Mm, no

134
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,961
Uh, look, Token, there's some shows
in LA we wanna book you on right away.

135
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,963
If you come out to my limo
we can talk everything through.

136
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:02,582
Oh my God! Okay!

137
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:04,393
Token, you signed with us!

138
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,761
Oh, come on, guys. You have to see
what a huge opportunity this is for me.

139
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,700
What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably
don't have a fountain in their lobby!

140
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:13,091
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.

141
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,775
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.

142
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,402
Mister, you can't do this to us!

143
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,726
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?

144
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,188
Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.

145
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,618
...Goddamnit!

146
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,500
So unfair... so unfair.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,987
All that time and effort we spent helping Token
and this is the thanks we get?!

148
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,482
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!

149
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,548
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!

150
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,385
Hello, is this the Talent Agency.

151
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,137
I see this sign on the street for a talent agency?
I need a representation.

152
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:54,445
Hey, wowee, nice fountain.

153
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,359
You were looking for a talent agent?

154
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,962
No, not me, my wife.

155
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,309
This is Wing. She just come over from China.

156
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:08,745
She over here uh irregarry.
The Chinese Mafia help me out.

157
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,951
And what does she do?

158
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,499
Ah, she sing. She very popular in China.

159
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,609
Hey, you just sit and listen.
You'll be very impressed.

160
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,143
Well? What you think?

161
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,781
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off
the ground would take too much work for us.

162
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,315
Aww, that's too bad.

163
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:56,262
She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres,
but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,687
You've ...already done all the work?

165
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,894
Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowrar.

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,641
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.

167
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:05,309
Yeah!

168
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,237
Rearry?

169
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:07,649
We'll go to LA with your wife.

170
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,890

00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,871
Yeah. So do we!

215
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,849
- Oh crap!
- Dude, how long is the wait?

216
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,978
It's been about 17 days for me.

217
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:41,224
Oh no, nonono, come on!

218
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,170
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:48,807
No, I don't think you understand.
We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing.

221
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,890
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency.

222
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:56,047
If your producers knew you were forcing people
 of our stature to the back of the line, well-

223
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,521
Oh, excuse me, everyone.
 That's my cell phone.

224
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:00,941
Hello?

225
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,762
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders!

226
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:07,975
Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, 
someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.

227
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,207
Aw, just forget it!

228
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,618
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders!
 You shouldn't give her any more chicken.

229
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,582
Goddamnit! Goddamnit!

230
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,369
We can't wait in line!
 We have to be in school on Monday!

231
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,508
Stupid assholes!

232
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:20,955
What do you mean your client isn't coming?!
We're taping the show tomorrow!

233
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,024
Where am I goin' to find another contestant?

234
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,022
Fine! Go screw yourself!

235
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:29,116
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say 
you needed somebody for your show?

236
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:31,053
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!

237
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:31,897
Really?

238
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:34,087
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?

239
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,714
Well yeah, winner gets a 1 000 dollars.

240
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:37,304
All right, our client will do it!

241
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,441
Great! You kids just saved my ass!

242
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:40,855
See you over at Stage 6.

243
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:42,710
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?

244
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,143
Naw, this is better. 
It's called The Contender.

245
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,282
What's "The Contender"?

246
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,860
Tonight, two people will compete for glory.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,898
One will stay, one will go home,

248
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,095
in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.

249
00:12:55,244 --> 00:12:57,240
- Hello.
- The Contender!

250
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,294
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender!

251
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:06,199
Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue 
and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico,

252
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,415
Manuelo Furrrrnanda!

00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,815
Le's go! Le's see a good fight!

254
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:23,060
And fighting out of the blue corner,
 wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!

255
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,166
- Come on, Wing!
- Let's do it Wing!

256
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,906
Brint it on Wing!

257
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,418
Oh my God, dude!

258
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,379
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.

259
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:55,707
Anyone?

260
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,809
Help four boys and a Chinese
 woman get back to Colorado?

261
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,714
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.

262
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:01,882
Hey kid!

263
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:08,879
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't
 go better for you back there.

264
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,322
- Oh, thanks.
- Yo kid.

265
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,945
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.

266
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:18,946
He really likes her voice.

267
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,915
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody,

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,630
it brings tears to his eyes.

269
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,217
Thanks, Mr. Stallone. 
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.

270
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,799
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.

271
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:36,770
You do??

272
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,273
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.

273
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,067
4.000$ ?!

274
00:14:44,313 --> 00:14:46,288
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.

275
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,693
And don't be late.

276
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:48,476
We won't!

277
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,148
You guys, you guys!

278
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,813
What?

279
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,053
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing 
at his son's wedding tomorrow!

280
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:01,426
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!

281
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:02,958
Get out!

282
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,259
That's four hundred for us! We did it!

283
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:12,795
- Who Let the Dogs Out?!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?!

284
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,000
Who? Who? Who who?
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ..

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,639
where's Wing?

286
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,720
What do you mean?
 We thought she was with you.

287
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,577
Naw, sh-she was with you!

288
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:22,731
...Oh Jesus Christ.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,592
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work,
 they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.

290
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,084
Wing? Wing??

291
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:31,853
- WING!
- Here, Wing!

292
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,365
You thought you could run from us, did you?

293
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,535
Oh no!

294
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:42,239
Hey! That's our client!

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,211
They did it to us again!

296
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,768
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!

297
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,809
Not this time! They dropped their card.

298
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,002
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!

299
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,038
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,109
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us,
 you signed your life away.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,912
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S.,

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,271
but when they get here, they become our slaves.

303
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:25,852
It's an age-old business,
 and nobody has the guts to stop us.

304
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,425
249A - all right, this is the place.

305
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,457
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.

306
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:39,054
Of course it's impressive!
 They steal everyone else's clients!

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,339
It's just four little boys.

308
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,892
Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.

309
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,777
Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!

310
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,957
Oh my God, you guys. Look!

311
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,501
They do have an amazing fountain.

312
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,303
You assholes stole our client!

313
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:03,997
How about some Goddamn business ethics?!

314
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,372
You tell 'em, Kyle!

315
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,241
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!

316
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,001
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!

317
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,397
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!

318
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:18,928
What the hell is that?!

319
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:19,694
Go! Go!

320
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,686
Dude, maybe we should give up!

321
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,073
No! Screw that, dude!

322
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:27,635
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients,
 we're never gonna make it as talent agents!

323
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:30,523
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough,
 we can play rough too!

324
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:31,749
CARTMAN!

325
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,775
Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!

326
00:17:37,763 --> 00:17:38,564
Take this!

327
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:43,751
We've gotta split up and find Wing!

328
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:44,988
You and Kenny go that way!

329
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:49,667
Wing?

330
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,554
Stupid talent agents!

331
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:16,197
All right, Kenny, let's go!

332
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:17,832
Kenny?

333
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,876
KENNY!!!

334
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,383
Don't worry, Kenny. 
You didn't die for nothing.

335
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:29,489
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
 and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!

336
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:37,795
They killed Kenny!

337
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:39,310
You bastards!

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,645
Enough!

339
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,997
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.

340
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:47,596
But you come any closer
 and I'll blow her brains out.

341
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't give us that crap! 
She's no good to you dead and you know it!

342
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,473
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her,
 'cause then she can't pay you money!

343
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:55,475
We know because we're in the same business you are!

344
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,931
This woman has a contract with us! We own her!

345
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,183
She had a contract with us first! We own her!

346
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,683
Her life belongs to us!

347
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,849
Her life belongs to us!

348
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,007
Guys! Guys! Guys!

349
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,073
Don't you see what we're doing?

350
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:08,536
Jesus...

351
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,848
we're not talking about an object here,

352
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,293
we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.

353
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,260
All this violence and anger and, and for what?

354
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,452
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.

355
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,055
Yeah.

356
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,722
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.

357
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:29,157
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.

358
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,261
Perhaps... you're right.

359
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,902
We spend all this time...
 mooching off the hopes and dreams of others,

360
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,181
forgetting that they are human beings.

361
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,218
Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.

362
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,520
I am tired of this business.

363
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,243
It is a very dirty and perverse business.

364
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:53,345
It's a lousy business. I quit.

365
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,075
Me too.

366
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,517
Aw aw guys, come on!

367
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:57,178
We quit too.

368
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,954
It's time for us to find another way to make money.

369
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:03,463
From now on, all contracts we have 
on people are null and void.

370
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:04,605
All right!

371
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,691
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you
 for coming to his son's wedding.

372
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,782
And now as a special treat,

373
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,411
it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing!

374
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,711
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.

375
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:38,962
You rearry helped us out.

376
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:40,664
Yes, you were right, kids.

377
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,469
Her voice is so beautiful. To think we would have
made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.

378
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:48,428
I think we all learned it's best to leave
talent to the talented people.

379
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:50,844
Send a cress in your plates, folks?

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,653
Token?

381
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,097
Oh... Hey guys.

382
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:54,509
What, what are you doin' here?

383
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,414
Token, you're... waiting tables?

384
00:20:56,727 --> 00:21:00,021
Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't
 really do anything for you.

385
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,435
I'm trying to work my way back home.

386
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:03,227
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.

387
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,154
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
 Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop!

388
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:13,181
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!

389
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,697
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.

390
