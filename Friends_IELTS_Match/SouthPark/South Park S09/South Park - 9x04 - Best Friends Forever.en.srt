4
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,693
Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!

5
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:39,880
MOM, GET UP!

6
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:42,108
Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,167
Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game
machines go on sale at seven a.m. today.

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,689
I have to be the first to get one! Come on!

9
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:50,600
Sweetie, can't we go after school?

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,726
Everyone's moms are taking
their kids after school!

11
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,980
We're outsmarting everyone by getting to
the store right when it opens! Let's go!

12
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,044
I can't wait to see the look on everyone's
faces when I show up to school with a PSP!

13
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,909
I wonder if Kyle will cry?
Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!

14
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,746
What the hell?!

15
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:16,619
Kenny, when did you get here?

16
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,417
Friday?! Aw, Jesus!

17
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,363
I'll just... sort of get in here- in here.

18
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,446
Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?

19
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,598
Uh, my friend Kenny was
saving my place in line.

20
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:30,656
There's no saving place, fourthie!
Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!

21
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:32,570
Oh, Goddamnit!

22
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,884
They'd better not sell out!

23
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,594
That thing is pretty cool.
What games did you get with it?

24
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:49,294
It's a game called "Heaven versus Hell." Kenny commands
the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,500
- Dude, you see what Kenny got?
- YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!

26
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,328
- Wuh what'd I do?
- JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!

27
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:02,261
"Congratulations! You have reached ...lever nine!"

28
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:05,746
Wow, level nine already?
Dude, you kick ass in "Heaven versus Hell."

29
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,189
Yeah, Kenny finally found
something he's really good at.

30
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:40,355
Kenny? Kenny, are you still
playin' with that thing?

31
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,619
Kenny, it's been two weeks
and you've done nothin' else!

32
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,182
Who cares if you almost
made it to lever sixty?!

33
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,900
You're wastin' your life, Kenny!

34
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,772
If you died tomorrow, what
would you have to show for it?!

35
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:56,354
You'er gonna end up wishin' you'd done more
with your life, just like your dead-beat father!

36
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,297
- Hey, I heard that, bitch!
- I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!

37
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,800
- How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
- I'd like to see you try!

38
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,205
You have reached level sixty!

39
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:19,515
Oh yeah, lever four, sweet!

40
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,168
Open the gate!

41
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,520
Open the gate!

42
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,726
Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven,
Kenny. I am Peter.

43
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,793
There isn't much time, Kenny.

44
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:11,532
You're dead, but, your death was no accident.
Heaven needs you.

45
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:15,607
Come! There is much to discuss

46
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,780
Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny.

47
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:33,200
Satan is planning a massiva attack
and he knows we are too few in number to stop him!

48
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,203
God has changed the rules here.
For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.

49
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,774
- Hello
- Hi, dear!

50
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:43,542
But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger,
 God decided to let more people cross over 

51
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:48,277
so that he could build an army as well, 
an army that YOU must command.

52
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,733
The Sony PSP was built by God,

53
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:56,587
to determine who on Earth had
the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan.

54
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:01,459
You... are the best.
YOU, are the only hope for the universe.

55
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,841
Satan's army grows as we speak.

56
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:09,825
The Dark Lord knows that our armies
are few in number, and unorgamized.

57
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:13,910
So our only hope... is perfect strategy.

58
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,149
A child? This is God's solution?

59
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:20,673
He beat Satan's army in over three
thousand separate simulations.

60
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:23,275
Archangel Michael, what say you?

61
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:31,119
The child did something none of us could:
Reach lever sixty on the PSP.

62
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,926
Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence,
but it's Goddamned impressive.

63
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:38,359
All right, Kenny, let me show
you what we're up against.

64
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,900
This is the Kingdom of Heaven.

65
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:44,887
Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here.

66
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,524
They are... ten billion in number.
Maybe more.

67
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,970
Our armies are here, here, and here.

68
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,141
Just under... ten thousand strong.

69
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:03,463
We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can
singlehandedly bring the whole Dark Empire down.

70
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:07,516
Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves.

71
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:26,056
My fellow damned souls!

72
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,389
Now is the time for our assault!

73
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:33,993
You know no fear!
You will drink the blood of angels!

74
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:38,060
We go now! Nothing can stop us!

75
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:41,289
Step aside! Step aside, I say!

76
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:44,151
Satan! God has mocked thee once again!

77
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:45,860
My spy!

78
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,300
God has found a way to defeat your army.

79
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,050
Impossible! How?!

80
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:54,400
A young man. Basically,
he he's like Keanu Reeves.

81
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:57,602
Oh Jesus Christ.

82
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,851
My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!

83
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:03,445
What's the point?!
They have a Keanu Reeves now.

84
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,281
Do not fear, my Lord.
Your army is great!

85
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:07,671
Very well.

86
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:11,900
Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven!

87
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:21,049
Up here, you get the best tactical
view to protect the fortress.

88
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:24,266
It is from here, Kenny, that you shall
command the armies of heaven.

89
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:30,350
Simple. You will use... this.

90
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,495
This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.

91
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:39,794
Hail the holy PSP.

92
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:42,198
It works just like the ones we sent to Earth.

93
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,928
All the commands you make will be sent to the
troops down on the battlefield.

94
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:51,364
All you have to do is play the game, Kenny.
Only this time, It's for reals.

95
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,923
Gabriel returns with news!

96
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,699
Hell's army is departing!
They head now for the Gates of Heaven.

97
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:01,487
Prepare the troops!
We must be ready for them!

98
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:02,948
The time is at hand, Kenny.

99
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:06,068
The stage is set and the final battle between
Heaven and Hell is about to begin!

100
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,461
The fate of the outcome is in your hands.

101
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:11,937
Where'd he go?

102
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:15,167
Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!

103
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:17,608
Then that's it! We brought him back.

104
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:22,778
Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody
who's been legally dead for almost a day!

105
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,301
Call the parents. They're going
to be shocked to find out...

106
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,844
their son is alive.

107
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:36,867
It's the latest in electro-plastilical science.
Your son's organs are all functioning again.

108
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:40,489
It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.

109
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:42,813
I'm a-fraid he can't respond to you.

110
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:47,153
You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's
brain cells died from lack of oxygen.

111
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:52,192
Your son is alive, but, in what we call a
"persistant meditative staute."

112
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:53,574
Will he ever recover?

113
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,052
I'm afraid no.

114
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,409
Brain cells cannot be repaied once dead.

115
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,875
But his soul is still in here.

116
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:02,572
Almost... trapped in here, if you will.

117
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,725
Kenny is the same as he ever was.

118
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:08,562
It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato.

119
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,778
He can't more on hiw own-ah how will he eat?

120
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:16,169
A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste
directly into Kenny's stomache.

121
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,505
With it we can actually keep Kenny
the tomato alive for years.

122
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,001
A feeding tube?!

123
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:29,602
Yes. Apparently they're using
machines to keep them alive.

124
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:34,748
But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny
to die! What are these people doing?!

125
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,801
The child's soul is now trapped
inside his vegetative body.

126
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,328
We have no one to command the troops with the PSP's

127
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,954
And Satan's armies are approaching.

128
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,954
Oh God-damnit

129
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,297
Boys I want to thank you for coming down to
my office on such short notice.

130
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,836
Are we in trouble or something?

131
00:09:57,915 --> 00:09:59,785
No. Boys, I'm a laywer.

132
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:03,472
Your friend Kenny has passed away
and I've called you here to read his will.

133
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,158
Kenny had a will?

134
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:13,627
In the highly liekly event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, 
wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle.

135
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,884
Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have.

136
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,919
That's... really touching.

137
00:10:21,464 --> 00:10:22,303
Fag!

138
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:23,861
To Eric Cartman:

139
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:28,045
Eric, I never really liked you.
But then, nobody does.

140
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:32,816
You have no ability to feel, and you are going
to die alone and miserable.

141
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:38,063
It is only because I feel so sorry for you
that I leave you my Sony PSP.

142
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:42,983
Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby!
Who the man? Who the man?

143
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,877
There is one more thing I would like
to ask you all, as my friends.

144
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:53,812
If I should ever be in a vegetative state
and kept alive on life-support, please,...

145
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,395
Please what?

146
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:02,009
I don't know. I lost the last page.

147
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,968
Who cares? Kenny's dead!
When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?

148
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,966
It's right here, along with Kenny's
other belongings. They're all yours.

149
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:11,971
Yes!

150
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,395
- He's alive!
- What?

151
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,898
Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!

152
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,344
Oh my God!

153
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,208
Your army nears the Kingdon of Heaven, my Lord.

154
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:38,953
I don't know if we should continue without
knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.

155
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,562
Satan! I come bearing good news!

156
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:46,243
The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth!
His soul is no longer in Heaven.

157
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:49,523
Then God is helping us.

158
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:54,012
Full march, to the Gates of Heaven!
Victory is ours!

159
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,000
Kenny?

160
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,466
- Kenny! You're alive!
- Dude, how's you do that??

161
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,015
He can't responde to you, boys.

162
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:07,008
Being dead for that long caused 
severe damage to his brain.

163
00:12:07,374 --> 00:12:08,889
Well... well then he's NOT alive.

164
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,050
He's alive. He-ee smiles when
I talk to him. I think...

165
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,857
That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint
and sets things on fire! Here, look.

166
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,215
Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?

167
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,887
I I don't know if it's right to keep
Kenny alive on that machine.

168
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,606
I I just... I don't know what he would want.

169
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,364
Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.

170
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:28,865
Oh, I just remembered!

171
00:12:28,953 --> 00:12:32,546
Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't
wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.

172
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:33,600
He did? When?

173
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:36,100
Um, it was um, this one time...

174
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:40,170
He did not say that!
You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!

175
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:43,279
Stupid? PSP is stupid?!
Did you all hear that??

176
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:48,023
Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle!
His is about my friend, and his wishes.

177
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,880

And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!

178
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:50,980
- He did not!
- Did so!

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,707
- Did not!
- Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!

180
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,767
I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed
if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court!

181
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,043
Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!

182
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:08,964
Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's
 soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.

183
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,788
No! There is another.

184
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,940
A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.

185
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:20,178
Are you stupid, Uriel?
Japanese people don't have souls!

186
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,459
- Yeah
- Yeah, Uriel!

187
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:24,260
Oh, right right, I'm sorry

188
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,245
Kenny remains our only hope!
Here is what we must do.

189
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,999
Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth
and try to get that feeding tube removed.

190
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,735
In the meantime we will put
all our troops at Heaven's Gate.

191
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:38,209
 We will try to keep Hell's Aermy 
from breaking through as long as possible.

192
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:43,613
Hopefull, it will be long enough
to get our Keanu Reeves back.

193
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:49,268
You see your honor, I was the only one that
Kenny McCormick told his wishes to.

194
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,413
And Kenny told me specifically that he would never
want to be kept alive on a machine.

195
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,855
What they're doing to him ...is not right.

196
00:13:56,892 --> 00:14:00,339
Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents
want their child kept alive.

197
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,576
I don't believe you have any
legal authority here.

198
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,269
I do have legal authority, your honor.

199
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,772
You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.

200
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,300
Best friends forever?

201
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:15,957
That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs
since first grade. Here, look.

202
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,000
Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace.

203
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:22,591
I believe you all know what that means,
and how serious this is.

204
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,654
Look, Kenny, your friends
are here to visit you again.

205
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:29,292
But this just doesn't seem right.

206
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:30,940
Wha, what's the matter, doctor?

207
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:34,329
I'm afraid I've been given a court order
to remove Kenny's feeding tube.

208
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,215
What?

209
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:37,424
- He's right in here.
- Cartman!

210
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,816
Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want
to be kept alive artificially.

211
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,482
The courts have determined
we must obey his wish.

212
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,328
Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!

213
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,242
Sir, take a look at this.

214
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:54,643
That's all the verification we need.
Pull the feeding tube, doctor.

215
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,322
No doctor! You can't!

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,346
I'm sorry. I have no choice.

217
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:04,847
Here is the hospital

218
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:09,782
This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth,
 how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?

219
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,844
That dirty no-good sonofabitch!

220
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,587
Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out,
he he's gonna die for sure!

221
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,418
The tube has been removed?

222
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,666
How can they let an eight-year-old
decide Kenny's fate?

223
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,420
Apparently, some blessed child
has done our work for us.

224
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,987
Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes
with the child's death a second time.

225
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,306
Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get
that feeding tube put back in!

226
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,623
- Yeah!
- No!

227
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:35,497
Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone
in the country know that they're killing Kenny.

228
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:36,517
Yeah, come on!

229
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,743
No! No, no boys! Aw Goddamnit!

230
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,049
This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate
is heating up in Colorado,

231
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,922
where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube
has been removed by his BFF.

232
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,563
Two boys are bringing national attention to this
story by protesting outside the hospital.

233
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,622
- Don't kill Kenny!
- You bastards!

234
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,327
- Don't kill Kenny!
- You bastards!

235
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:03,068
No! No, they're not killing him,
they're letting him die!

236
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:07,327
You bureaucrats have no right to
play God and take that tube out!

237
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:10,487
Nono, see, they were playing God when
they put the feeding tube IN!

238
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,631
A woman was arrested for trying
to bring food to the patient.

239
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:16,120
Get your man-hands off of me!

240
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:21,456
However, a growing number of people are also
standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman.

241
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,064
We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs.

242
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,976
Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces
would become meaningless

243
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:34,108
We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is
the highest legal authority.

244
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,602
That's right. Respect our authoritih-m.

245
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,282
What mockery is this?!

246
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:40,548
My Lord...

247
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,524
The feeding tube has been pulled!

248
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:46,743
If the child dies and his soul returns
to heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!

249
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,497
Perhaps the child won't die in time.

250
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:51,641
Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!

251
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,042
No!

252
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,912
Keep your army marching, my Lord.
I will get that feeding tube put back in.

253
00:16:58,782 --> 00:16:59,902
How?

254
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:04,124
I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.

255
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,469
We Republicans are deeply saddened by
the tragic events in Colorado.

256
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:15,682
Removing the feeding tube is murder,

257
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,744
Removing the feeding tube is murder!

258
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:21,746
Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?

259
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:25,068
Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?

260
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,653
It is God's will that he live!

261
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,940
It is God's will that he LIVE!

262
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,825
No no, you don't say that part.

263
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,000
No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha.

264
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:52,380
Jesus, their army is massive.

265
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,458
Heaven help us.

266
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:59,757
The biggest battle of all time is about to begin:
the battle of the feeding tube.

267
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,132
As people on both sides of
the argument vie for media attention.

268
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,780
We want all the country to see that
Kenny is alive, and in pain!

269
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:12,000
I believe the people at home see he's NOT
in pain because he's a tomato!

270
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,740
You say tomato, but I say Kenny!

271
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:15,670
You say Kenny, but I say tomato!

272
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,400
- Tomato!
- Kenny!

273
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:24,155
Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found
the last page of Kenny's will.

274
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,300
What?

275
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:31,600
I found the page where Kenny specified
his wishes about being on life support.

276
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,226
Well, what does it say?

277
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:41,062
If I should ever be in a vegetative state
and kept alive on life support, please...

278
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:48,311
for the love of God, don't ever show me in
that condition on national television.

279
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:59,872
Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand.

280
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:04,361
This issue is so complicated, but...
mmaybe we shhhould just let Kenny go in peace.

281
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,700
You mean, Cartman's side is right?

282
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:09,510
Cartman's side is right,
for the wrong reasons.

283
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,601
But we're wrong,
for the right reasons.

284
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:16,395
Come on, everybody.
I think Kenny wants to be left alone.

285
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:26,362
We've just received word that Kenny McCormick...
has passed away.

286
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,774
The debate still rages on in America,but at least
now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place.

287
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:35,979
The armies of Satan have already
broken through the gate!

288
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,760
We're gonna die!!!

289
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:41,436
Send our troops to the battlefield!
I'll command as best I can!

290
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:45,481
Michael! Michael!
The humans finally did the right thing!

291
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,795
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

292
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,492
Get him into the command station! Hurry!

293
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,082
Satan's army charges!
Tell our troops what to do, Kenny!

294
00:19:54,318 --> 00:20:00,136
So it begins. Now we shall see the final
battle between Heaven and Hell play out!

295
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:10,350
Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen
are taking out their demon soulrippers!

296
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,479
Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing
with their Black Knights!

297
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,898
Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic!

298
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:22,656
Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons!
Look at the size of them!

299
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,950
My God, this is even bigger than
the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie!

300
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:31,658
It's like, it's like TEN times
bigger than that battle!

301
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:36,456
No! NO! How are we losing?!

302
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:39,637
The child's soul is in Heaven!
God has his secret weapon!

303
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:40,938
We'll retreat!

304
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,458
Patience, my Lord!

305
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:45,922
No, Kevin!
That's it! I'm breaking up with you!

306
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,607
Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating!

307
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:55,529
This is TRULY a sight to behold!
OH I wish I had a camcorder!

308
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,307
We have done it! We have defeated 
the armies of Satan!

309
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,446
Kenny! Bless your soul!
You've saved all of Heaven!

310
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:15,592
Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done,
we are going to give you a very special gift.

311
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:20,575
For saving the entire universe from
the forces of evil, we give you this.

312
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,920
Keanu Reeves' statue.

313
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:27,430
Congratulations.
