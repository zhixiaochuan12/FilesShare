1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,560
Hold still, Ike! We have
to get you dressed!

2
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,640
- Where the heck is Kyle?!
- I don't know!

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,560
Come on, Kyle! You're gonna
be late for Jew Scouts!

4
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,922
- Kyle.
- I'm comming, Ma!

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,480
Go get the door, Kyle!

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
"Get ready! Answer the door!" Jesus
Christ! Make up your friggin mind!

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,580
Oh! Hey, Kenny! - How's it going?!
Wanna go watch a meteor shower?!

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,380
I can't watch a meteor shower with
you, Kenny! I have to go to Jewbilee!

9
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,293
What's that?!
- It's what we do in Jew Scouts!

10
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:05,326
Usually, we just sit around and
make stuff, but tonight,

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,589
because there's a meteor shower, we're
gonna do some big thing out in the woods!

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,890
It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure!
- Hey! That's easy!

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,840
Hey! Maybe you can go with me!
Then it won't suck so hard! - Really?!

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Mom! Can Kenny go
to Jewbilee with me?

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Well Kyle, Jewbilee is sort
of a ssspecial thing!

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,320
Oh! Kenny isn't special?

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,880
No, no! You're very special,
Kenny! It's just that...

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Well... Jewbilee
is for Jewish kids!

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,680
You see, boys! Jew Scouts
is a special group

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,000
that borrows a little bit from all
different Jewish denominations!

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,360
From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hesidic
Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews,

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,800
but you have to believe the basic
tenants of Judaism to be a scout!

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,780
Kenny will believe whatever
you want him to! - Yeah!

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,960
Kyle! Eh-the problem is...

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,560
Please, Ma! I don't think Kenny
has anywhere else to be tonight!

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
Oh, alright! Just don't let any of the
elders know that he isn't Jewish! Okay?

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,080
Come on, Ike! It's
time to go to Squirts!

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,400
You have to be in Squirts if you're
too young to be a Jew Scout!

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't worry, Kenny! I'll fill you in
on our faith on the way up there!

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,320
And then, Kenny, Abraham's
wife bore him no children.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,040
She had a handmaid Egyptian
who's name was Hagar!

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,840
And Sari said unto Abraham, "Behold, now!
The lord hath restrained be from bearing!

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,420
I pray thee!
Go into my maid!".

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,000
Abraham begot Isaac,
whom the lord then said to kill!

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,380
But, that was just a little silly trick
to see if Abraham would do it!

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,160
No, Ike! Ma! Ike keeps taking
off his Squirt's uniform!

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,820
Ike, you behave!

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,270
I don't think Ike
wants to go to Squirts!

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,700
Ike, your brother Kyle
was in Squirts and so was I!

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,980
You have to go so someday you
can be a big brave Jew Scout!

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,900
Tell Ike how much
fun Squirts is, Kyle!

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,280
- What, you want me to lie?!
- Yeah! Lie!

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,060
Oh! Ike, Squirts is so much fun!

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Oh, my God! What is that?!

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey! It's a bear!

46
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:57,400
- Wow! Cool! - This retreat
really is out of the way! Isn't it!?

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,520
Welcome to Jewbilee!
You folks find it okay?!

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,880
Yeah! Actually, we saw
a bear a few miles back!

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,680
- He was huge! - Yeah! We
spotted him a few days ago!

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
Nothing to worry about though!
Your boys are safe with us!

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm sure they are!

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,000
We'll be back to pick you up after
the meteor shower party, boys!

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,400
Goodbye, boys! Kyle and Ike,
you be safe! And Kenny...

54
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,640
Try and act Jewish!
- How do I act Jewish?!

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
C'mon, Squirt! We're
meeting over here!

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,300
Who are you?!

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,880
I'm the Squirt Leader! I don't
want to be the Squirt Leader,

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,960
but I don't have a choice! It's the only
way I can earn my Hudhpa badge!

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,800
I gotta spend all night
instructing Squirts!

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
You have to go with him, Ike!

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,320
Don't worry, Ike! Squirts is fun, and I'll
be right over there in the next building!

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,400
Come on!

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,020
- Name!
- Kyle Broflovski.

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
Kenny MacHeimerberg.

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880
Alright! Get to Mashugana Hall!
The meeting is already starting!

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,991
What's this?! - This is
where the elders meet!

67
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:58,692
Nobody's allowed to go in there
when they're having a meeting!

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,960
I want to welcome you to all! Though we
each come from a different sect of Judaism,

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,920
on this night of Jewbilee,
we all pray to Moses as one!

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,080
Now, let us introduce ourselves!

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,480
Elder Karn from the
Orthodox synagogue.

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Elder Harris from the Hesidic sect.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Elder Garth from the
synagogue of Anti-Semites.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't believe I've heard of the
Anti-Semetic sect of Judaism before!

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
We're new!

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,960
Okay, Squirts! The elders have given
us a very important task tonight!

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
We're all going to make
macaroini pictures like this one!

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
Using dry macaroni,
paper, and glue!

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
How come we have to
make macaroni pictures?!

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,000
Because that's what Squirts
do! Now, shut your pie hole!

81
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,680
- What's your name?
- No!

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,520
How come your head is
looking so... funny-looking?

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,000
And that's how we'll be
making tonight's craft!

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,960
And so you see, Scouts,
all you need is a bar of soap

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,960
and a dull knife! And you can make
nifty soap sculptures like these!

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
Here's a girraff!
And here's a cloud!

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,554
You can all pick up your
bars of soap later on

88
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,655
as we will all be making
soap sculptures tonight!

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Now, this year we are pleased
to anounce that Jewbilee

90
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,120
has grown to over one hundred Jew
Scouts from all around the country!

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,600
All new inductees raise your hands!

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
That's you, Kenny!
Raise your hand!

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
And what is your
name, young man?

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
Junichi!

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Oh! Wonderful!

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,240
Could you run out and grab some,
some of those candles for us?

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,040
There we go!

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,900
Now, I would like all the new
inductees to step forward please!

99
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
This part kinda sucks, Kenny!
But, don't screw it up!

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
Raise your left hand
and repeat after me.

101
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,060
I pledge to be a Jew Scout.

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
My honor wide and true.

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,200
I am proud to be a Jew scout.

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,000
Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.

105
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,920
Okay, Squirts! Let's see what you
made macaroni pictures of!

106
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,220
Ishmael?

107
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,880
- Apple!
- Good!

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
- Mathew!
- Cat!

109
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
- Joseph!
- Triangle!

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
- Okay! Ike!
- Kokershang!

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,800
You don't make a macaroni picture of
the last supper at a Jewish camp!

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
What the cheese?!

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,860
Oh, my God! It's that bear
they've been talking about!

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,000
Where'd he go?!

115
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,720
Squirts! Go grab your gear!
We're gonna go hunt us a bear!

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,640
Then I'll get my
Hudhpa badge for sure!

117
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Oh, enough already! What
has Moses ever done for us?!

118
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,200
All sects of Judaism
follow the words of Moses!

119
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,880
Not mine! Tonights meteor shower
is the sign of the new time!

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,120
We should use it to pray to Haymen
and enter into a new millenium phase!

121
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,680
Enough, elder! You will not speak
the name of Haymen here!

122
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,554
All you ever do is worship Moses,

123
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,355
but it says in the book of Centuries that
Haymen will one day lead the Jews!

124
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,560
We pray to Moses here, Elder!

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,920
If you guys love Moses so much,
why don't you marry him?!

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,520
We accept all denominations of
Judaism here at Scouts, Elder.

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,800
But your synagogue of
Anti-Semites is too strange!

128
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,000
Get out and do not return! You
are no longer welcome here!

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,400
Fine!

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Jewbilee is the time of Haymen! You will
all see how wrong you are very soon

131
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,720
when Haymen returns from the
ninth tower of devolutionment

132
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,360
and smokes Moses and all his followers
into pillards of dust of dust that would cry

133
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,080
for their petty lives but can't having
recently been turned into dust and all!

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,640
You will see! You will
see this very night!

135
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,800
C'mon, Kenny! You have
to get in a circle!

136
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,553
What the heck are we doing?!
- This is where we all stand in a cirle

137
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,960
and pray to Moses for
guidance during Jewbilee.

138
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,070
That's fuckin' stupid!
- It is not stupid, Kenny!

139
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:46,771
This is my faith and you
shouldn't make fun of it!

140
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,925
Alright, Jew Scouts! The meteor
shower will start soon!

141
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:52,026
Let's pray to
Moses for guidance.

142
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,218
Moses, great leader,

143
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,353
on this blessed night of Jewbilee,

144
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:58,972
we ask for your tutalige.

145
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,720
May the teachings of Moses

146
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,480
fill our ears and our
hearts respectively.

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,720
Stupid assholes! Moses ain't
gonna teach them anything!

148
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,360
Do not fear, Haymen!
This night shall be yours!

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,240
And the Anti-Semetic Jews
will once again rule the earth!

150
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,640
We are Squirts! We are Squirts!
We're so kosher that it hurts!

151
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
When we get older, we'll be Scouts,
but until then, we are Squirts!

152
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
There he is, Squirts!

153
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,160
Okay, Squirts! Remember the
plan! Imobilize and attack!

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,614
Mathew! You imobilize
the bear with the net,

155
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,915
and echo team, run up and
attack it with your squirt knives!

156
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,286
Don't get too close, now!

157
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:43,887
Just close enough to throw
the net on the stupid bear!

158
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
No!

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Oh, Frank!

160
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,440
God!

161
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,760
Oh, the bear took a squirt!
Oh, I'm gonna get it now!

162
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,840
What's happening!
- Shut up, Kenny!

163
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,560
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!
- That's Moses, stupid!

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,960
Great Moses, we your most loyal followers
want to thank you a lot for coming.

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,800
The hour of Jewbilee is near!

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,160
Let all debts be forgiven
and all slaves free!

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
Alright, Scouts! Let's all show
Moses our soap sculptures

168
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
so that he may
rejoice and be pleased!

169
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
It's a duck!

170
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,276
...and it was fortold that the spirit
of Moses would finally rest when

171
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:10,760
his spirit was imprisoned by Haymen
in a cockshell of blind faith.

172
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,360
Cockshell! Like this one! Neat!

173
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Moses, the Squirts have made
you tidings of macaroni pictures.

174
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,720
They should be here any second.

175
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,960
Where the hell are the Squirts! We need
those macaroni pictures for moses right now!

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,440
Now, we'll just see how
Mr. Bear loves rat poison.

177
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,640
That ought to be enought
to kill a super bear.

178
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
Okay! Raise the tray!

179
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
Hudhpa badge, here I come!

180
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
Okay! Here he comes!
Easy, now! Easy, Squirts!

181
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,360
Okay, Squirt! Lower the tray!

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,280
That's it! That it, you
goddam stupid bear fraidy!

183
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
Jesus! Holy God!
Another Squirt!

184
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,840
You think you can stop me from getting
my Hudhpa badge, you stupid bear?!

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,640
Think again!

186
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
Great and honorable Moses, what do
you desire from us, your children?

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
I desire...

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,120
I desire macaroni pictures.

189
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,960
Y'yes, yes! The macaroni
pictures are coming right away.

190
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Uh, anything else you want from
us, o great leader of the people?

191
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,520
I desire popcorn necklaces.

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,400
You heard him! Get to making
popcorn necklaces right away!

193
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,920
All you need is some popcorn
and a needle and thread.

194
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Hold!

195
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,200
There is an an impurity.

196
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
Oh, no! He's on to me, Haymen!

197
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
An impurity, Moses?

198
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,640
This child bears not Persia.

199
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,920
What the hell are we gonna do!
- Don't worry! I know what to do!

200
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,019
Scout Broflovski, have
you defiled Jew Scouts

201
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,920
by bringing a Non-Hebrew
to Jewbilee?!

202
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,420
Elder, It's not my fault! He told
me he was Jewish! - What?!

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,240
A Non-Jew has impultrated Jew Scouts
and looked upon the face of Moses.

204
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,640
He must be dealt with. - I tried to tell
him I wasn't Hebrew just before we left!

205
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,361
You are banished from here.

206
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:45,062
You must leave before the great
eating of carrot cake. - What?!

207
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
He doesn't get cake?!

208
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
No cake for the impurity!

209
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,920
Go now! You do not belong here!

210
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
Elder! What are you doing?!

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,640
He's reading from
the book of Haymen!

212
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,520
Into the cockshell, Moses!

213
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
Help!

214
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,960
And there you shall stay!
Trapped for all eternity!

215
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,640
Elder, what have you done?!

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,200
I told you! The meteor
shower's the time of Haymen!

217
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,560
I am running Jewbilee now!

218
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,160
- Release Moses now!
- I don't think so!

219
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,960
When do we get
to eat carrot cake?

220
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,280
Now, all of you into that building
or I'll shoot you where you stand!

221
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,880
- Elder, you cannot mean...
- Move!

222
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,880
Now! Now, Haymen!
Your time has come!

223
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,640
Dude! What the
hell is going on?!

224
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,560
If he summonds Haymen,
we will all be destroyed!

225
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
We know Jewish shtick, shtick, shmaler
shmaler, shtick, shtick, shmaler, shmaler!

226
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,600
Hold it, Squirts! This is
where we'll set our trap!

227
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,560
Everyone remember their squadron! Alpha
5 and Gamma 7 will be on recon team!

228
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,240
Alpha will take left plank and flush
the bear out of sector 3!

229
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,880
Once we're in position, I want costant
contact between all squad leaders!

230
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,000
We'll flush him out and
then we'll attack him!

231
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Remember, this is only a bear! All
we have to do is stick together

232
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,640
and we can spend the rest of the
night making bear sandwiches!

233
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
Where's Ikmael?!

234
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,583
Gosh dammers! You stupid
goddam son of a bear!

235
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:42,160
You've taken your last
Squirt! You hear me?!

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,200
"And the ancient one looked upon
Hayman as the new leader of the people".

237
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,160
"And it was the night that
stars flew around the sky".

238
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,440
If he summonds Hayman, it will be
the end of everything we hold dear!

239
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,760
I wanna go home!

240
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,720
That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well,
I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get a...

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,160
Heh! Hold! Look over there!

242
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,720
It's one of the Squirts the
bear took! Maybe he's okay!

243
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,360
IT'S A TRAP!

244
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,080
Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!

245
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay, bear! That does it!

246
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,480
You wanna kill all the squirts?!
You can have them! I give up!

247
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,680
I don't need my
Hudhpa badge,

248
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,520
or Jew Scouts, or any
of this crap! Forget it!

249
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,920
Let the new tide turn! Let
Haymen rule his people once again!

250
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,480
We await your return, Hayman!
You passage is safe from enimies.

251
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,520
It's hopeless! - Hayman will be summoned
and we will be forced to obey him or die!

252
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,880
- I-I'm fine with obeying!
- Yeah, obeying should work out swell!

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,240
Don't worry, you guys! He forgot
about Kenny! Kenny will help us!

254
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,280
- How?!
- Kenny will find a way!

255
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,880
Hey! Welcome to the party!

256
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,080
See this little bear cub?
It's his birthday!

257
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
Yeah! So his mommy brought
us all over to play with him!

258
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,960
Uh, oh!

259
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,671
What's the deal?! You know all about this
Haymen at your age?! You're so young!

260
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
C'mon, Squirts! We
have to help them!

261
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,880
Elder Squard! I lost the
Squirts! I lost all the Squirts!

262
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,120
Well screw you! I don't need
your Hudhpa badge anyway!

263
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,600
Frodo! Get us out of here!

264
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,880
What the cheese!? What
are you guys doing in there?!

265
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,200
Get the keys and unlock the door!

266
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,320
- What?! - Get the
keys and unlock the door!

267
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,120
I lost the Squirts!

268
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,280
- Look out!
- Huh?!

269
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,440
- Don't move! - Oh,
Jiminy Gravy! What's this?!

270
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
It's the summoning of Haymen, fool!
The wakening of a new kingdom!

271
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,880
You can't wake Haymen!
What would Moses say?!

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Moses is trapped for all eternity
in the cock of blind faith!

273
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,600
Oh no, you don't!

274
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,480
Enough of this waste of time!

275
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,880
"Haymen! The great
summoning is done".

276
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,320
"Upon these words, let
your spirit come. Inek! Foas".

277
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
Is it lost?!

278
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
Hey! Give that back!

279
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,880
It's the Squirts!

280
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,560
Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys
are up there! - They'll never reach!

281
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,240
Squirts! Fall in!
Chinese formation!

282
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,800
Gimmie that book!

283
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Haymen will deal with you!

284
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,320
Oh, no! It's too late!

285
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
- What is that?!
- It is Haymen!

286
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,880
Free! Free to punish
those that imprisoned me!

287
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,240
Haymen! It's me,
Garth! I freed you!

288
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,241
Okay, fine! I'll hit
it with my head!

289
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:10,425
Kenny! Noooo!

290
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,080
Moses! Noooooo!

291
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,960
Moses! Uh, I... I apoligize
for any inconvenience!

292
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,720
You see, I was just, uh...

293
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,360
Die!

294
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
That blow to his head
must have killed him!

295
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,880
He saved us!
He saved all the Jews!

296
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Y'know, I think we
all learned something today!

297
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,520
It's fine to have your own
beliefs and your own traditions,

298
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,648
but as soon as you start
excluding people from your ways,

299
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,949
only because of their race,
you become separatist!

300
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,680
And being a separatist sucks ass!

301
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,440
We've learned a lot from you
and your great friend Kenny!

302
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,960
Every year, we shall gather
here, this speacial place,

303
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,720
nd bring Kenny tidings of soap
sculptures and macaroni pictures.

304
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,400
And those little
shaker things where

305
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,520
you put beans inside of paper
plates that are glued together.

306
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
Paper plate bean shakers!

307
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,600
And let us put patterns of glue on
the outside of those paper plates

308
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,880
so we can then pour glitter on
them so they look nice and sparkly.

309
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,280
You heard him, Scouts!
Let's get to work!
