1
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,701
I don't wanna go to
the stupid party!

2
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,302
Come on, Stan! You're
gonna have a great time!

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,346
No! YOU guys are
gonna have a great time!

4
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,475
Whenever there's a party, the adults
get to hang out and have fun while

5
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,776
the kids spend the night locked in
the basement eating stale pretzils!

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Well, your Mom and I don't get out much,
so you'll just have to bear through it!

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,800
Hello! Welcome! Mkay?!

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,480
This is already a wild party!

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,480
Yeah! Well, sorry we had to bring the kid
along. We had nowhere else to put him!

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
Oh, that's okay! I got a special kids
room down in the basement!

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,200
Be sure to help yourselves
to the crab soufle and the...

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,640
Wanita! Wanita! We need
some more finger sandwiches!

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
I don't wanna hang out in the
kids room! I won't know anybody!

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,106
Well, it would be good for
you to make new friends.

15
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,107
You can't just hang out with
your buddy Kyle all the time!

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,560
People'll think you guys are...
You know! Funny!

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,520
- I bet you'll have a great time!
- Here we go! Its right in here!

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
We'll be upstairs if you
need anything, Stan!

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,080
- Dad! You can't leave me here! These
guys are total melvins! - Have fun, Stanley!

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
No, Mom, please! They're the
geekiest kids in our school!

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,960
We'll come get you kids when
the meteor shower starts!

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,720
- Cherrio, Stan! I do say, it's quite a nice
surprise seeing you here! - Shut up, Pip!

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,640
Hey, Stan! Weeell,
I sure am glad you're here.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Cuz then we'll have even more fun than
we... Well, than we was havin before!

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,520
We w'... We were havin an awfully good
time before you showed up too, However.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
- Butters, is there any way out
of here? - Nope! No way out!

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,440
But... but there ain't nothin upstairs
but an old stupid party anyways!

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
It's better down here
in the kids room.

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,440
This here is Dougie! He's not too old,
but he sure is a hoot to hang with!

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Uh, he's a first grade, I think!

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
I like math!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,710
We were just playing a game called Wicker
shums and Decklers. Do you want to play?

34
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:18,135
No!

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm the head Wickernicker,
and you are all Wickershangs.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,529
We all sing the merry tune of
Stratford untill I yell "Tarah!",

37
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,160
and then you all fall down laughing
and I join you as I find it funny too!

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Stan, would you be the
Wickershangerbrungerbrier?

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,720
Well, alright! Here we go!

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,800
Great party, Mr. Mackey!

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,160
Mr. Hat just grabed
Principal Victoria's Ass!

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,280
No! Mr. Hat!
You get back here!

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,800
Anyone for some meteor mai tai
punch? It packs quite a wollup!

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Oh, I'll pass! I don't
drink hard alcohol!

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,280
C'mon! Loosen up! Meteor showers
only come once in a great wild!

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,200
One little drink isn't gonna hurt
anything, honey! Live a little!

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Well, it is kind of a special night.
I guess I could experiment!

48
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,320
Yeah! Experiment!

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,649
- Are you sure you don't
want to play, Stanley? - Yes!

50
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,233
What are you, a sour puss?

51
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,534
Weeell, you really oughta play,
Stan! It's an awfully fun game!

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,544
I've never been to England, buuuut I
bet the people there are real nice!

53
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:16,545
Are people nice in England, Pip?

54
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll bet they are, huh! They
got those thick noses and all!

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,160
Hey! Look at this! - What is it? Is it
something neat? I wonder what it could be!

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
- It's a box filled with
ladies clothes! - Neato!

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,830
Heey! You know what we could do
with these lady clothes? Huh? Why!

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,231
Weeeell, we could
play Charlie's Angles!

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
Aw, Dude!
You godda be kidding me!

60
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,900
Ah, yes! Let's! Can I be
Jaqueline Smith? Can I?

61
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:35,040
No! I gedda be Jaqueline Smith!
See, I thought of Charlie's Angles!

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,080
And I gedda be Jaqueline
Smith! Cuz I thought of it!

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,160
Oh! This stuff's as fun as
Wickershungs and Decklers!

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,800
Come on, Angles!
Let's get dressed!

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,080
Which ladies garnments would you like, Stan?
- Dude, I'm not putting on ladies clothes

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,320
and I'm not playing Charlies Angles! You
guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you!

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,120
So, you go ahead and be
Melvins and leave me alone!

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,920
Well! Alrighty, then!

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Here it is! I just had the
hot tub put in last week!

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,760
- Wow! Neat!
- It looks quite inviting!

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,160
Yeah! You can get a lot of
action when you have a hot tub!

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
Oh, Mr. Mackey! You nut!

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,541
- Hell! We should get in!
- Yeah!

74
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,840
Sure! Go ahead! It's a...
it's a party, isn't it, mkay!

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, I'm not hot tubbing!
I have nothing to wear!

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,000
That's okay!

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,480
- No hot tub for me!
- Well, screw you guys!

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm getting in for a while too!

79
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
Geronimo!

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,160
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila! It's
just like they're in college again!

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Okay, Angels! What's
our mission this week?

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,006
Well, I don't know what our mission is!
Do you know what our mission is,

83
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,107
little first grade kid?
- How should I know?

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
Oh, dear! We're Charlies Angels
but we don't have a mission!

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,765
Hey, that's because we need Bosly!

86
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,165
Bosley always told the Angles
what there mission was!

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,720
Remember Bosley? Wellowell,
we need somebody to be Bosley!

88
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:44,373
What?!

89
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:47,680
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but
would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?

90
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,080
- What do I have to do? - You just
godda tell us what our mission is!

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,200
That's all Bosley does! Just give a
mission and us Angles will accomplish it

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,281
Alright, alright!
Here's your mission!

93
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,282
In ten minutes this room is gonna fill
with water and drown everybody!

94
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,440
You have to find me a
way out of this room fast!

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh! That's a splendid mission!

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,648
Well-uh! What are we waiting for?
We godda find our way out of this

97
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,549
room, by golly! Or else,
we're all gonna get drowned!

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
C'mon, Angles!

99
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,600
Which Angel am I again?

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh, boy! It's nice to have a
night out without the kids, huh!

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,680
Yeah, I know what you mean!

102
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,760
I love having a family and all!
I just miss being able to party,

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,520
drinking and socializing, experimenting
with all kinds of different things.

104
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Well, that's what being
young is all about!

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,058
Once you have a family and a career,
your experimenting days are over!

106
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,459
But, tonight is the exception!

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,440
That's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar!
Only 'cause I've never smoked before!

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
Good idea!

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,840
What haven't you tried that
you've always wanted to try?

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,200
I don't know! Maybe I'll drink a few more
beers and see where the party takes me!

111
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:40,611
Yeah!

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,520
- Was that your leg?
- Oh, you mean this?

113
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,840
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that was me!

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,320
- Bosley, Bosley!
- What, Pip!

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh, no, no! My name is Sabrina Duncan!
Remember! We're playing Charlie's Angles!

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,240
- What the hell do you want?!
- Well, we've completed our mission!

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,480
- Jim found a way upstairs!
- He did?!

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,755
- Air shaft! - Dougie pushed
that big box out of the way

119
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,856
and found this
old ventalation duct!

120
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,520
And I reckon it's godda lead somewhere!
I'ts good, 'cause now we won't drown!

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
- So, Bosley, what's our next mission?
- We're going upstairs!

122
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,148
Upstairs? Why, there's ain't
nothin upstairs but adults!

123
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,349
Why would we want
to go upstairs for?

124
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,400
Because, you stupid melvins, they
have rad food and deserts upstairs!

125
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Hey, did you see Principal
Victoria in there? She looks hot!

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
She sure does! I wouldn't
mind taking that home!

127
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,960
Oh, ho! Yeah, ha! I'm sure
your wife would love that!

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,653
I wish! That's the one thing I've
always thought of experimenting with!

129
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:26,491
A threesome!

130
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,120
- With two girls or two guys?
- Well, two girls, of course!

131
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,120
I mean, with another guy,
you know, that'd be...

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,640
Dude, you've never had a
homosexual fantasy? Not that I have!

133
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,960
- You haven't?
- No! I mean,

134
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,520
well, they say everyone has
at some point, don't they?

135
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,720
Well, I never really wanted to
experiment with anything too crazy!

136
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
Maybe just...

137
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,160
I don't know... masturbate
in front of another guy.

138
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah! Well, that's...
that's not really gay! Is it?

139
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,080
No! No, I don't think so!

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,760
Well, it is a night
for experimenting!

141
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,360
Sure is!

142
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, I'll start!

143
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,960
This must be the place! They've got all
kinds of crazy things going on in there!

144
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Code seven! Legally, we've found the
compound! Request Immediate backup!

145
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay! So just what is
going on here, people?

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,207
- GET DOWN!
- What?

147
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:30,753
It's just like we
told you, officer!

148
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:33,732
There's a religious cult in there that
plans to commit mass suicide

149
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,014
when the meteor shower
starts! - Are you sure?

150
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,340
Of course, we're sure! We're the
Beaureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,

151
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,441
and Fire Arms! It's our job to
know what these fanatics do!

152
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,080
So what does the ATF do when religious
fanatics are going to commit mass suicide?

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Uh, don't worry!
We won't let that happen!

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Even if it means we have to
kill each and everyone of them!

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,320
What's the situation? - Apparently, we've
got at least five dozen men and women

156
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,080
in there who intend to commit suicide
when the meteor shower starts!

157
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,800
Any luck talking to
somebody in the house?

158
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,640
We've tried calling, but there's no answer!
I think we're gonna have to move in, sir!

159
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
- Alright! Johnson!
- Sir!

160
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm sending you in! Watch
your ass! - Yes, sir!

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,880
Oh! Come on in!
Join the party! Mkay?!

162
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Would you like a meteor mai tai?

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,960
Hey! I love mai tais!

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,760
We did it! Great job, Angles!

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,840
So, what's our mission now? Huh, Bosley?
Whadya want us to do now, I wonder?

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Alright, Angles! Uh, your next mission is
to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set!

167
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,560
What kind of cookies
do you want, Bosley?

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,040
- I don't care! Just hurry!
- Uh, hooray!

169
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,960
So! Well! That was certainly...
interesting! - Yeah!

170
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
You don't regret
doing it, now do you?

171
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,720
No, no! What's there
to regret? Right? I mean,

172
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,748
all we did was watch
each other... masturbate!

173
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,520
That's... that's not gay or
anything! We said so! Right?

174
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,880
Tha... that's right! It's just
harmless experimenting!

175
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, lets get back into the party
and see what everybody's doing!

176
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,600
Hey! Nothing changes between us,
right? I mean, we're still friends!

177
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,800
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure!

178
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,680
Dammit! Where's Johnson?!

179
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,840
No communication, sir!
It doesn't look good for him!

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Those bastards!

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Great party, Mr. Mackey!
Thank you so much!

182
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,360
Are you sure you
have to leave so early?

183
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,920
We both have to be up early
tomorrow, but thanks again!

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,280
Mkay! Drive carefully! Mkay?!

185
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,160
Hold it right there!

186
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Whatever it is you are
intending to do, do not do it!

187
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,600
Your freaky religious cult
will not succeed in its plan!

188
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:44,600
What? - Do not move or
we will forced to shoot...

189
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,280
God dammit! Who was that?!

190
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
Did you see them move?

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,440
- I did! - Yeah! Yeah,
they moved alright!

192
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,800
Well, I'll tell ya what!

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
We may not have Elway this year, but Brister
won every game he started in last year!

194
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,360
Well, that's true! But Elway was the
heart of the team! Who's the leader now?

195
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,960
I think the Jets are gonna be the
team to beat this year in the AFC!

196
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,164
Yeah! Hey! If you watch another guy
masturbate, does that make you gay?

197
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,480
- What?! - Well, I just...
I have this buddy!

198
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,520
Uh, he sat and watched
another guy play with himself!

199
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,440
- Well, lets go kick his ass!
- Yeah!

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,360
- Where is he?!
- Oh, he lives in... like... Florida!

201
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,280
- Hey, Randy! What're
you doing? - Nothing!

202
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,416
- I'm gonna go get some chips.
- Can I come with you?

203
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay! - Come right
on in here, Bosley!

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,200
It was my idea! I-uh got to thinking,
where do people keep TV sets,

205
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,240
and then I remembered that lots of
grown-ups have TVs in thier bedrooms!

206
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,120
So I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom,
uh, and sure enough! Here it was!

207
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,960
Rad!

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Okay, Bosley! We've got you cookies and
a TV set! So, what's our next mission?

209
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,520
There are no more missions!
I have everything I want!

210
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,960
Weee ain't got no more missions?
What're we s'posed to do?

211
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,520
We're Angles! Wha'do
Angles do without missions?

212
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Just play something else, Gawd!

213
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,160
Oh, dear! We've
angered Bosley!

214
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,960
Tom, I'm standing in front of
a house where a religious cult

215
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,840
is planning to commit mass suicide
when the meteor shower starts!

216
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:10,280
- Woah, cool!
- I wanna be a reporter someday!

217
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,800
Just moments ago, a couple
emerged from the house!

218
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,600
According to the ATF,
the couple refused to co-operate

219
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,400
then pulled out very big guns
and started shooting everyone.

220
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,973
The ATF had no choice but
to shoot the insane couple.

221
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,874
And now, a stand off has insued.

222
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Oh! That cult is about to
be blown into tiny bits!

223
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,352
The ATF Commander tells us that he
has reason to believe there may be

224
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,920
children inside and that they... - Wait a
minute! - are the primary concern of all!

225
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, my God! Dude! That's this house! They
think our parents are the religious cult!

226
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you think someday
I could be a reporter?

227
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,630
We've just received a photo from the
RECON team of the action inside the house!

228
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,084
howing evedence that there are
indeed inocent children trapped inside!

229
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,664
Those sick cult
fanatic bastards! - Dude!

230
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,030
Hey! Our parents
aren't religious fantastics!

231
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:55,431
Why, we godda tell them that they're
makin an awful mistake! Don't we?!

232
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,720
Yes! Come on, Angles! Looks
like we have a new mission!

233
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,760
Randy, you're making me feel
unimportant! Talk! Talk, damn you!

234
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,480
Look, I'm just having a hard time
with what we did in the hot tub!

235
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,040
So... so now we
can't be friends?

236
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I didn't say that! I mean, I don't
know! I... I just feel so strange.

237
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,120
I know it's ridiculous, but can't help
feeling like people here know!

238
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,400
Like, even though nobody could know
cause we said we'd never tell anybody.

239
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,960
We said we'd never tell anybody?

240
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,520
- Well, of course we wouldn't!
- Oh! Well, I didn't realize that!

241
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,680
- You didn't... tell anybody! Did you?
- Well, a few people! Yeah!

242
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,160
What?! Why the hell would you do that?
- You didn't say not to tell anyone!

243
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Well, of course, I thought
it would be implied!

244
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,603
When you masturbate with
another guy in a hot tub,

245
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:41,504
you assume that nobody's
gonna tell anybody!

246
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,400
Listen to you! You're yelling at me!
You've never yelled at me before!

247
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Hey, you guys!
We've got a big problem!

248
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,320
The ATF is outside and they think you're
all a religious cult! You gotta talk to them!

249
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,280
Uh, How come they're
actin that way, Stan?

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
How come they're laughin
and fallin down and such?

251
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,880
- Mom! Go look outside!
- Mommy's little poopykins!

252
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,520
Lemmie handle this, Stan! Uh, now
listen up and listen good everyone!

253
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Why, I'm awful dissapointed in you
drinkin and carryin on this way!

254
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,240
Why, you... you should
be ashamed yourselves!

255
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,941
If you don't get outside right now, and
tell those army guys you're not a

256
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:22,120
religious fantastics, there... well, there's
gonna be heck to pay! Yep! Heck I tell ya!

257
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
Come on! We're gonna have
to to tell them ourselves!

258
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,720
- Lay down your weapons!
- We don't have any weapons!

259
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,200
Go back inside and tell everyone
that they are surrounded!

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Tell them to come out peacefully
and we will not shoot them!

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,480
Get back inside!

262
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,840
I don't think they're gonna come
out. Use the Gagnes technique.

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,440
- What's the Gagnes technique?
- This is what we did in Waco!

264
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,960
Play really bad music really
loud until it drives them nuts

265
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
and makes them
wanna come out!

266
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Nobody can stand this much Cher!

267
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,800
This is her new album! If this
doesn't drive them out, nothing will!

268
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,360
That's great music,
Mr. Mackey! What is that?

269
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,480
Oh, this is Cher!
This is her new album!

270
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,200
Well, hell! Turn it up!

271
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,960
Yeah! Well, you know what I
heard! I... I heard that he's gay!

272
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
- Oh! Is he?
- Who?!

273
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,320
- Who... who did you hear is...
is gay?! - Ricky Martin, the singer!

274
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,362
- Hey, Randy! What's up? - What
the hell is that supposed to mean?!

275
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:23,440
- Huh? - Look! Sho... shouldn't you be
hangin out with your wife right now?

276
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
- Well, I just felt like talkin to you!
- There's nothing to talk about!

277
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,640
- Your having regrets, aren't you?
- No! Why? I don't know!

278
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
- Hey! Talk to me!
- NO!

279
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,480
I thought we agreed what happened in the
hot tub wouldn't change our relationship!

280
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,080
Will you stop it!
I don't...! I just...!

281
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn! You might not
need to talk about it, but I sure do!

282
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,400
Sharron! Sharron!
Can... can we go?

283
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,200
Go?! The meteor shower
hasn't even started yet!

284
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,568
I know, but I want to make
love to you right now!

285
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:52,869
I have to make love
to you right now!

286
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,680
Randy, relax! We don't ever get to party.
Now, come on! Loosen up! Experiment!

287
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,120
Oh! I already did!

288
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,840
- Dad! Dad! They shot at us!
- Not now, Stan!

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,280
- Mom!
- Whoopie!

290
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,880
Hey! What're we gonna do, huh? They
shot at us! They really shot at us!

291
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,360
They ain't gonna stop until we're all
dead, I betcha! House and all our family!

292
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,680
Get a hold of yourself, man!

293
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,493
How come you slapped
my face, Stan? Huh?

294
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,494
Why... why on earth would you
go and do that for anyways?

295
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,920
C'mon! We have to find
out what's happening!

296
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
I'm standing now
with Danny Gagnes,

297
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,800
the commander of the ATF.
Commander, what is the latest?

298
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,890
We have not had any co-operation
with the cult inside the house!

299
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,933
They are refusing to come out and
apparently, they still plan to commit

300
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:35,400
mass suicide once the meteor shower
starts which should be any moment now!

301
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,400
See how reporters get to wear those cool
jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.

302
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,960
So what are your
plans, commander?

303
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,267
Right now, our plan is
to burn the house down.

304
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,768
If we set it on fire, they'll have
no choice but to come out.

305
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,280
Oh! Dear God! They're
gonna set us on fire!

306
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,520
Oh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife
of Joseph! What're we gonna do!

307
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,720
Oh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary,
but not father of sweet Jesus!

308
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Setting them of fire seems a
little dangerous, commander!

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,960
It is! But we can't let
them kill themselves!

310
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,913
We have to let them
know this isn't a cult party!

311
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,714
But we can't! They'll
just shoot at us again!

312
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,920
Uh, they're gonna burn us up
and act like nothin happened!

313
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, sweet Jesus! Mary, mother of Jesus,
wife of Joseph, father of Mary!

314
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,640
Well... wait! Mary,
wife of... Hold on!

315
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,440
Come on, Angles! We've got a new
mission! And this time, it's for real!

316
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,880
Four hours now, the ATF
has tried to communicate

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,240
with the religious
fanatics inside this house.

318
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,080
The meteor shower is expected to begin at
any moment. And so, time is running out!

319
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Ho, ho! Look! Harold's doing
it again! Hm, hm! Hmkay?!

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,400
This is Jill Monroe reporting live from
inside the meteor shower party.

321
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,320
As you can see, this is a
perfectly normal party.

322
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Nobody is killing themselves.

323
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,080
We tried to tell ATF people,
but they shot at us.

324
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,040
- Anything else?
- Tell them not to burn us down!

325
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh, yeah! Don't burn us, please!
Jill Monroe, GFN news!

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,880
Now, what do we do? - Now, we find a way
to get this tape out to the real reporters!

327
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,280
Hey! I'm a real reporter!

328
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
You're right! You are, Dougie!
You did an awesome job!

329
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Attention, cult people!
Do not commit mass suicide!

330
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,520
There are so many reasons
not to kill yourselves!

331
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,640
Flowers, for instance!
And back rubs!

332
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,280
Alright! I'm through trying to reason
with them! Send in the negotiator!

333
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,931
Excuse me, but what
proof do you have

334
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,932
that those people inside
are religious fanatics?

335
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,720
We know what we're doing!
We did this all before in Waco!

336
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,240
Yes, but you totally screwed up Waco!
You killed a bunch of innocent people

337
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
and then tried to say
they killed themselves!

338
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,760
- Look! You see this?
You see this? - Yes!

339
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,934
You see it? You see it?

340
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,185
Go get it! Go get it!

341
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,920
Alright! Let's get ready to kick
some religious fanatic ass!

342
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
- Having a good time?
- Yeah! Swell!

343
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,483
Could I just have a
few minutes alone?

344
00:17:45,484 --> 00:17:47,184
I'm not gonna let you
change on me, Randy!

345
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,480
Just because we shared an intimate
moment in the hot tub, I won't...

346
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,480
We did not share an intimate moment!
Okay? That makes it sound gay!

347
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,480
- G'night everyone!
- Look out!

348
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,360
Hold your fire! Okay!

349
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,200
People at the door!
That was a warning!

350
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,000
Go back inside and tell the others that
they now have one minute to surrender!

351
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
Oh, no! We're out of time!

352
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,640
- Are you sure you can do this,
Butters? - Well, no! I'm not sure!

353
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
I'm not sure at all!
What am I doin again?

354
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,751
We're just gonna slide you down
this rope then you gotta get our

355
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,252
exclusive video to that
reporter down there!

356
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,800
That sounds awful dangerous!

357
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,040
Can you hit a target, Pip?

358
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,040
I was Audrey Class,
Esquire! Scrap Archer!

359
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,440
Hit something
nice and solid, now!

360
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
I think that's got it!

361
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,640
- Nice job, Pip!
- Did I do a nice job, really?

362
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,440
Alright, Butters!
Now, it's your turn!

363
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,760
Weeeell, I don't know about
this! I... I think I'll reconsider!

364
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Yep, I think reconsidering
is the thing to do right now.

365
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,560
He made it down!

366
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
Alright, people, prepare
to fire on my command!

367
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,880
- Mr. Reporter Man, sir!
- Huh?

368
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,440
Uh, we've got an eyewitness
exclusive video for you sir!

369
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,600
- Honey? - God! Everybody's
looking at me!

370
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,520
Everybody knows! - Everybody doesn't
know! Why are you so ashamed of me?

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
What's happened to you?! You've
become all needy and talkative!

372
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,315
I just want to know if it
meant something to you!

373
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,816
IT DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO ME, GERRY!

374
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,000
All WE DID WAS WATCH EACH
OTHER MASTURBATE IN THE HOT TUB!

375
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,520
I was just IN the hot tub!

376
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,400
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it
would be exciting and maybe it was!

377
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,983
But, I can't deal with
your accusing stares!

378
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:33,400
We watched each other
jack off in the hot tub!

379
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,480
There! We did it! I'm not
prowd of it, but there it is!

380
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,720
Well, it's not like you're the only guy ever to
watch another guy masturbate! I've done it!

381
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,480
- Me too!
- Yeah! I've done it a few times!

382
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,720
- Yep!
- Me too!

383
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Aww, hell! I... I've done it
too! With Cameron, here!

384
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Wanita, could you fix some
more dip? Please, Wanita?

385
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,320
You mean it? I'm not gay?

386
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
Well, maybe a little!
But, we're all a little gay!

387
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh! I feel so much better! Wow!

388
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,040
- So, we're friends again?
- You bet we are, Gerry!

389
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,760
I feel great! I feel like I could take on
the world! Everything gonna be okay!

390
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,720
Alright, everyone! Fire!

391
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,040
Hold on just a minute! This
is Derrik Smalls reporting!

392
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
We've just recieved an exlusive
video from inside the house!

393
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
Proving that the people inside
are not cultists after all!

394
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,840
Attention, everyone!
This has only been a test!

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,649
- Good job, men, on this, uh,
simulation! - Simulation?

396
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,240
ll is well! Do not shoot at...

397
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
I believe we saved the day!

398
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,240
- Sir, this isn't gonna look good!
- You're right!

399
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Quick! Let's get out of here!

400
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,400
Say, that was a fine
piece of journalism, boys!

401
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,640
- Wow! You mean it?
- Sure!

402
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,756
Why, with your tape,
I'll be able to make millions

403
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:59,357
and further my career
beyond my wildest dreams!

404
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,200
Wooaah! Hooray, then!

405
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, Angles! I must say!
I think we did a smashing job!

406
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,400
We sure did! Why, we put the fear of God
into those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya!

407
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,200
But you know,
I learned something today!

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,977
I used to call you guys melvins!
But, you're just kids like me!

409
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,767
We separate you in school because
you talk different or study too hard!

410
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:17,068
But, we've proven tonight
that we can all get along!

411
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,960
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends,
Stan? Won't that be swell! Huh!?

412
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,640
Dude! I'm glad to see you!

413
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,120
You would not
believe the night I had!

414
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,519
You?! You think
you had a bad night?

415
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
I had to hang out all night
with these friggin melvins!

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,360
- Oh, Dude! Weak!
- Super weak!

417
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,760
C'mon! I'll tell you all about
what happened to me!
