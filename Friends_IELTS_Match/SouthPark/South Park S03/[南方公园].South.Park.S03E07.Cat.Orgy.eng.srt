1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
Now I will kill the president and kill Salma Hayek!

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
Oh Save Me! Who will save me!

3
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
I will!

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
James West! Cowboy and rapstar.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,080
Quick, Artimus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,840
If we save her, I'm going to take off her pants and play slip and slide!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
Are you okay, Salman Hayek?

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,560
Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and buritos,

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,080
migusto tacos mucho!

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,000
You cannot stop me, James West!

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,160
Look out, Artimus Clyde Frog, its a giant metal Spider!

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,320
We saved the day!

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Eric!

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
The babysitter's here! Come on downstairs.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,560
But, Mom, I'm playing Wild Wild West!

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,080
I have to leave soon, Eric.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,680
But, Mom, me and Artimus Clyde Frog

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,720
still have to do our last scene with Salma Hayek!

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,680
Come down as soon as you're done!

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,600
Well, I'm a bad assed cowboy livin in the cowboy days.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,520
Jiggy wiggy! Scratch! Yo, yo! Bang, bang!

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,120
Me and Artimus Clyde Frog

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,360
go and save Salma Hayek from the big metal spider.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Black cowboy from the west side!

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,680
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly!

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
- Okay! - All his other babysitters won't come back!

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,800
I charge five dollars for the first hour, five percent bucks every hour

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,320
after that up to six hours which enters into golden time.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,960
Oh, that sounds fine! I'm going to a Meteor Shower Party!

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,240
The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,480
Eric's snookie time is nine o'clock sharp.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,680
If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,920
And, if he gets cranky, just play tummy rub rubs with him.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
- And make sure he wipes good after he makes bears. - Bears?

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh! And don't mind the cat! She's just being loud because she's in heat.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,680
No, Kitty! I don't have anything!

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,240
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,920
No, Kitty! That's a bad god damn Kitty!

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay, muffin! Mommy's leaving now!

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,980
- You do what the babysitter tells you! Okay? - Uh huh!

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
- Be good! - Right!

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,240
- Come give Mommy eskimo kisses! - Aww, Mom!

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Eskimo kisses for Mommy!

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Jesus Christ!

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
Bye, kids!

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
Alright, turd! Listen up!

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,360
Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge!

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
I don't know how you treat your other babysitters,

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,720
but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd!

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,000
You're a stinky, dried-up, stupid turd! Got it?!

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,360
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those ninety videos on tv?

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
My boyfriend is comming over!

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,640
So, you go to the kitchen and you make us that pizza

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,200
before I snap you in half like the little turd stick you are.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,280
You're not allowed to have people over.

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
Move!

58
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
This is bull crap!

59
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,080
I can't reach the freezer!

60
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
Figure it out, turd!

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
God Dammit!

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,960
Shut up, Kitty!

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,240
"Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303...".

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,433
I'm gonna call Mom and tell her that the babysitter's

65
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,880
having her boyfriend come over, then we'll see who's the turd.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,600
So, I said, you're a little turd! And he...

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,080
Dammit!

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,520
But, if you've seen one turd, you've seen them all.

69
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
Stupid turd! For once...

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
Hey! I need to use the phone!

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh, hold on a second, Gary!

72
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,000
I pulled his underwear over his head!

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!

74
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
Shut the hell up, Kitty!

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,440
And now, back to the movie of the week. Aliens.

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
They mostly come at night! Mostly!

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,600
"They mostly come at night! Mostly!".

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
- Hey! I was watching aliens on TV! - Well, I'm watching Friends, turd!

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,776
That's my boyfriend!

80
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:49,977
Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces!

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,200
- Hey, is Shelly around? - Who the hell are you?

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,236
I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up

83
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,037
your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
Hey, Styler!

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,360
- You know this guy? - He's my boyfriend!

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,720
- Christ, he's like fifty years old! - He's twenty-two!

87
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,480
Dude! That's not cool!

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,440
You're a turd! You're the turd man of Alcatraz!

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,640
Heh! Yeah, ha!

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters had thier boyfriends over,

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
she mostly gets really mad! Mostly!

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,440
- Ah, goddammit! - Turd weggie!

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,880
Come in the kitchen, Styler! There's a refreshment!

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
And now back to Wild Animal World.

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,960
Here in the more airid regions of Africa,

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
the Gold Colt Lions are in the throwse of mating season.

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,880
The male lion positions himself behind the female

98
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,080
and prepares to insert his lionhood.

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,640
Notice his large swolen balls.

100
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
The female relaxes her body

101
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,880
and says hello to Mr. Winkie.

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,840
The male lion is inticed by the females subtle breasts and firm back side.

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished.

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
Now, he want's to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,160
He promises he'll call her tomorrow.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,800
But the female doesn't leave, Nope! She's moving right in!

107
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Looks like the male lion is screwed!

108
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,240
No, Styler! Quit it!

109
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,200
C'mon, babe! How long have we known each other?

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
Eight days tomorrow!

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
And, I still don't get any action!

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,257
I don't know, Styler!

113
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:37,558
It's just kind of strange to me that you're twenty-two and all.

114
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,400
But, I'm still in high school! I told you I'm a very immature twenty-two year old!

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,680
- Well, maybe just one kiss! - Hey! What're you doing?!

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
- Beat it, chubby! - Go on, astro turd!

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm gonna tell my mom on you!

118
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,560
Turd rock from the sun!

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Hey! You ate all the pizza!

120
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,200
We left you some crusts!

121
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now and busting your ass!

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,320
- Guess again, Richard the turd! - Gimmie that phone number!

123
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,240
C'mon babe! Let's go to the living room.

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,960
I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!

125
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,680
Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques

126
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,600
and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.

127
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,440
Goddammit, Kitty! You have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip!

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,320
Okay! Okay! Hold on! Find the catnip!

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Rafp Rugnaf fills muh ahsi SOE!

130
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,240
Demons from hell seek the chosen one!

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,880
You're such an amazing poet, Styler!

132
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Isn't this guitar awsome?

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,680
t's the best of its kind! And not a scratch on it!

134
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
Styler, not here!

135
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,120
I can't help it! I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them!

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Really?

137
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,240
I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar!

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,200
When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping

139
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,440
and buy you lots of bad ass stuff!

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,560
Oh, Styler! I love you!

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
What the...!? - So right you are! Looks like you're the turd now!

142
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Gimmie that picture!

143
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Open this door, turd... ledove!

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,320
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!

145
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,680
You're mom doesn't get home for three more hours!

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,200
That's pleanty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you!

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Gimmie that picture, turd!

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,680
You're never gonna get this picture!

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,480
Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over hnya!

150
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm gonna bust this door down!

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
What shall we do, Artimus Clyde Frog?

152
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,440
We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she can come home and save us!

153
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Oh! That's quick thinking, Artimus Clyde Frog!

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty! I am putting this picture

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
of the baby sitter and her boyfriend on your collar.

156
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,581
You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty,

157
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:21,982
so that she can come home and and save me.

158
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,640
Now, run, Kitty! Take the picture to Mommy, and lead her back here!

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,960
When you return, be sure you bring Mom into the back yard!

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!

161
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
That's it, little Kitty!

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
God dammit!

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,520
Who is that?

164
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh! I invited the guys in the band over so that we can practice.

165
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,920
Styler! You're band can't practice here!

166
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,440
Hey! Do you want me to make it or not! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe!

167
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
'Sup, Mark! 'Sup, Joansy!

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
Just keep the volume down!

169
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,840
I have to go deal with turd boy!

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
Hey! Who was that? Who came to the door?

171
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,240
Eric! You're Mom's been in an accident!

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,560
You just want me to open the door!

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,280
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back!

174
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,840
What?! Is she okay?

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,280
Not really! She's dead!

176
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,760
Ha, ha! That was a turd trick! You're Mom isn't really dead!

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,200
Ha, ha! I knew it was a turd trick and I opened the door because

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,840
Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my Mom's party with the picture!

179
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
I knew you set the cat! And that's why I went outside and got him!

180
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,720
I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty,

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,240
and that's why I wrote a letter to the press to be opened in case of my demise!

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,195
So, should anything happen to me, that letter

183
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,096
will go out so that you will never find it!

184
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
You mean this one?!

185
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay! Let's see, now!

186
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
Aw, dammit!

187
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,320
Okay! Check! Check! Check one! Two! Check! Okay, ready?

188
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Alright, let's try the new song! This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly!

189
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,320
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly! Shelly!

190
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,920
Aw, man! You guys suck!

191
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Now that we're together, I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly! Shelly!

192
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,000
You're the crappiest band I've ever heard!

193
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,760
Move into my Mom's house with me Shelly! Shelly!

194
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,160
Bridge!

195
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,040
I pledge alligance... to the flag... of the United States...

196
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
of Shelly, Shelly!

197
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,440
Oh, my God! Somebody shoot me in the head!

198
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
Hey! Shut up, tubby!

199
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,480
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in hnya!

200
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,080
You get out now and respect my athoritah!

201
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,800
Yeah, Dude! That was hot! This guitar rocks, Man!

202
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,760
It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?

203
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,160
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,280
Oh, really!

205
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,000
I just think you're sound is kind of... last week.

206
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,360
Well, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!

207
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,840
Well, I do have a song I wrote!

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, why don't you sing it for us?

209
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,640
No, Styler! I'm embarrassed!

210
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,880
Hey, Man! Don't be shy!

211
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,560
Well, okay! I'll try!

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
But I'm not promising anything!

213
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,880
1, 2, 3, 4...

214
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,840
So much pain in the world today!

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,200
Too many turds are headin my way!

216
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,000
But, we can vex the turds together!

217
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,240
Passing by turds whenever!

218
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,920
Don't you know it's a...

219
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,360
Life so void of happiness!

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,400
Feel free to mark my words.

221
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,600
But, me and you where my love grew,

222
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,400
in a world that's full of turds!

223
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
Momma doesn't speak! They're lovin turds!

224
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!

225
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh, no, no, no! That's impossible, hon! I told her no visitors!

226
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,440
Well, there's a whole crappy band here! Can you hear them?

227
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,560
This party is very loud, poopykins! You'll have to speak up!

228
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Dammit! Her boyfriend is here! Don't you believe me?

229
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,280
Not really, hon! Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour!

230
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,280
Mkay!?

232
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
I'll never be able to prove that sonofabitch was here!

233
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,360
My Speak-N-Record Bear! Of Course!

234
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,200
In a world that's full of turds! Turds!

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,280
- Dude, this is gay! - Shut up!

236
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,200
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,200
Yeah, dude! What the hell's wrong with you anyway? She's like twelve!

238
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,960
You guys get out! Don't question my love!

239
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,000
My love is as pure as morning snow!

240
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
Get out, I said!

241
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,840
Testing! Testing! One, two.

242
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
Testing! Testing! One, two.

243
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,980
Sweet!

244
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,373
Were gonna go outside to watch a meteor shower!

245
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:04,274
I'm locking you in your room 'till we get back in, turd!

246
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay! See you in a while!

247
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Will you tell me what it looked like? The meteor shower?

248
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,080
They mostly only come every few years! Mostly!

249
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,680
What the hell is wrong with you? How come you're not yelling and whining?

250
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,400
Well, I just... I kind of like having you around! - What?! No, you don't!

251
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,160
No! I'm seriously! See, I never had a brother or sister.

252
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,800
I think people that have a brother or sister don't realize how lucky they are!

253
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,470
Sure they fight a lot! But to know that there's always

254
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:29,671
somebody there, somebody that's family,

255
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,702
I wonder if... well... maybe sometimes,

256
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:34,553
I can pretend like you're my big sister. And, you can kind of

257
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
watch over me. You know!

258
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,680
Like we could watch a meteor shower together sometime!

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,720
And I can pretend I'm somebody's brother! If only for a day.

260
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Alright! Get your turd coat! You can come see the meteor shower with us!

261
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,760
You mean it? - But, don't bug me and Styler! C'mon!

262
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,080
Hooray!

263
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,966
Yes! I'm gonna have you and you're boyfriend's

264
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,557
voices on my speak-n-record bear!

265
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,160
And then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly!

266
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Yes, yes! What a beautiful night! It is Saturday the twelveth at 10:45

267
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,960
and my mother is away at a party right now!

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Shut up, turd!

269
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,960
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, age twelve.

270
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
- What're you doing? - I'm just thinking out loud!

271
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,645
Do you have anything to say, Styler,

272
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,846
Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right hnya?

273
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,400
Go away, turd!

274
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm sorry! Did you say something, Styler?

275
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,320
- Yeah! C'mon! Give it up! - No! - Give it up, babe! - NO!

276
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,360
- C'mon, baby! - No, Styler! I'm not putting out for you!

277
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,720
- Why the hell not?! - 'Cause I'm twelve!

278
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,600
- You're not gonna put out for me? - No.

279
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
Well, then screw you, bitch!

280
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,360
I've got pleanty of other girlfriends that will!

281
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
What? But, I thought you liked me!

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,376
If you're not putting out, then I'm moving on!

283
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:04,377
There's pleanty of chicks like you out there!

284
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,960
Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my bad ass guitar are going home! Hasta!

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Gotcha!

286
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
Awicky wicky Wild West!

287
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,080
Shelly, guess who's busted!

288
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey! I said guess who's busted!

289
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,120
You're not gonna trick me! I go the goods on you!

290
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't care!

291
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,640
He acted like he really liked me! Nobody's ever liked me before!

292
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,640
I can't believe I trusted him! I'm so stupid!

293
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,400
But, Jesus! He's twenty-two! What were you doing with him anyways?

294
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,440
Nobody my age will go out with me because I'm too ugly!

295
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,880
- You're not ugly! - You don't think so?

296
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,880
Well, you're pretty ugly, but you don't have to be dating twenty-two year olds!

297
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates twelve year old girls?

298
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,720
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I can get him back! I just don't know how!

299
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,480
Well, I could ask Artimus Clyde Frog. He would know!

300
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,200
- If you want, I could help you! - Really?! You would do that?

301
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,240
Just let me get my cowboy hat.

302
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,280
What the hell is this?!

303
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,480
Help me! Help me!

304
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,200
This is Salma Hayek!

305
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,720
Is anybody there?

306
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,560
Salma Hayek? Whoa! She's hot!

307
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,880
Okay! It's clear!

308
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
Over here! Please! Come quick!

309
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,920
- We don't have much time! - This won't take me long!

310
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,080
- Hurry up in there! - I'm almost done!

311
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,240
Hello! Hello, Mrs. Hayek!

312
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,840
Over here! Please! Hump me! I am lost and I have no clothes!

313
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
No clothes! Rad!

314
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,080
I'm over here! Please, hump me! I will reward you greatly!

315
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,680

316
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,560
Please hump me!

317
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640

318
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,440
Please, hump me! I will give you tacos!

319
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,320
Dude! Somebody tricked me!

320
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,080
I'll make you pay for making me come out here, Goddammit!

321
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,080
Stupid assed stuffed animals trying to ruin my night!

322
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,300
My guitar! NOOOOOOOOO!

323
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,200
That was so cool! I wish we could've seen his face!

324
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,640
Thanks for all your help, Eric! You know, as far as turds go, you're okay!

325
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh, my God!

326
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,600
There having a cat orgy!

327
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,840
You are all very bad kitties!

328
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,160
That is a bad, bad kitties!

329
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,800
Your Mom's gonna be home soon! We're gonna get in busted!

330
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,880
Come on, kitties! Outside! C'mon!

00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,000
That's it! C'mon! C'mon!

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You two ruined my carreer! I'm gonna get you!

333
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,080
What're you doing?! Ah! Oh! You riped my pants off!

334
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,440
Oh, my God! Oh, naughty cats!

335
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,240
C'mon! We gotta get the house clean before you're mom gets home!

336
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,400
You know, Eric, It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends!

337
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,840
Yeah! I think we get along okay!

338
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,360
Hi, kids! I'm home!

339
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,440
Mom! I can explain! It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!

340
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,880
No! It was Eric's fault! He let these cats in here!

341
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,160
What a party that was!

342
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,760
- Wow! She passed out! - Lucky for us my Mom's a total lush!

343
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,800
Well, let's clean up the house! Looks like everything turned out okay!

344
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,600
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West!

345
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, I'm a bad assed cowboy living in the cowboy days.
