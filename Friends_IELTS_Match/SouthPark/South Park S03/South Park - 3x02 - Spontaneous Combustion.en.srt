1
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,760
- Is this what you're looking
for, Kyle? - No, I don't think so.

2
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,880
- How about this? - No, that's a hair
dryer. - Can I help you find something?

3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,440
- Yeah, do you have any
erections? - Any what?

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,560
I need to get an
erection for my dad.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,405
- Very funny, boys! Go on,
beat it! - Why is that funny?

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,728
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting
all the time, and everyone says it's

7
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,929
because he doesn't have an
erection, so I wanna get him one.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,080
Dammit! What the hell
is wrong with everybody?

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,480
That's the fifth store we've been kicked
out of! Why is it so hard to get an erection?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,840
I just want an erection
so I can give it to my mom.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,950
What? - See you guys.
I've gotta go get a bus.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,160
Oh where you gonna go, Kenny? You
gonna see your little girlfriend again?

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah, she must love me - Dude, you spend
way too much time with that girl. If you...

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,960
- Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,160
- What the hell happened to him?
- He just... ignited!

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,440
What happened?! - I saw it from across
the street, he just caught on fire!

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,880
Okay, people, stand back, give the
little burnt boy some breathing room.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
I've heard about this! This
is spontaneous combustion!

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,480
But it usually only happens to
fat people near open flames.

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
- Is it contagious? - Am I
gonna spontaneously combust?!

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,240
- I hope nothing happens to me!
- This is very scary!

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,080
The people are panicking
about spontaneous combustion!

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,502
That's why I've assembled
this crack team of scientists

24
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,503
to find out the cause
of the phenomenon.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
You are the best scientific
mind South Park has to offer.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,960
- Uh, mayor, I'm a geologist.
- Right.

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,080
Well, I don't study human
biology, I study the Earth.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Look! You're the only
scientist that lives in this town.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,804
You have to find an answer
before more people combust.

30
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,805
You do that and you'll be the
most beloved man in South Park.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,320
Randy! Randy! Randy!

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
We love you Randy!

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,080
Make love to me Randy! Please!

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Marsh, I'm not asking
you, I'm telling you!

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,680
Find the cause of
spontaneous combustion or else!

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
- Or else what?
- Exactly!

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Dude, he looks so peaceful
without his little orange coat on.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away,

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,440
sometimes the giveth seems a little
disproportionate to the taketh,

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,720
there seems to be a lot more
takething going on, but there it is.

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,080
Perhaps if more of you
attended church on Sundays,

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,560
the Lord would not have felt it necessary
to punish us by takething this little boy...

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Oh, here comes the guilt trip again!

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
Now, let us pray!

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,360
Lord,

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,480
though we have lost Neil Smith to free
agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets,

47
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:08,440
still, we hope our beloved Broncos can
bring home another Superbowl championship,

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,400
and once again bathe in the
glory of your light. Amen.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Let's go...

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
Let's go...

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,520
Broncos...

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
Broncos...

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,480
Let's go Broncos!

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,440
Broncos, let's go!

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,661
Wow, that was short!

56
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:28,240
Boys, I haven't seen
you in church lately.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
Well, I'm Jewish.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
- You're not to Jewish to worship
Jesus, are you? - I guess not.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,200
Good! Boys, how would you like to perform
the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,000
It's like a skit where you reenact the death
and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,240
Hey, a resurrection!
That's what my dad needs!

62
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:44,800
- Huh?!
- We'll do it! We'll do it!

63
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,520
Wonderful! Here's a book on how
to perform it. Don't let me down boys.

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Dude, this is great! You know all
the Stations of the Cross, right Stan?

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna
have to go look in the Bible.

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
- Good night Jerry.
- See ya Tom.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,960
- Bye Helen.
- By Jer...

68
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,600
- Oh my God! Another one!
- Helen! No!

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
- What happened?! - God must
be very angry with us, but why?

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,960
How have we
angered you Lord?!

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,360
Now let's see if they combust...
no... could be from... no

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
- Dad, where's our Bible?
- Not now, Stan!

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,280
I have to find out what causes
spontaneous combustion or else.

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,320
- Or else what?
- Exactly.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,440
- What?
- Right.

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,320
- Where's our Bible?
- It's in the attic with the old LP's.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,911
Boys, did you notice
anything strange

78
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:30,012
about Kenny in the weeks
leading up to his combustion?

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
What did he spend his time doing?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,600
He didn't do anything. He was
always with his new girlfriend.

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,848
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and
he spent all his time taking the bus

82
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,749
to go visit her, what does
that have to do with his death?

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe nothing.

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
Maybe everything.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,374
Well, we're gonna go work on
getting Kyle's dad an erection.

86
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,692
Yes, yes, of course,
I've got work to do.

87
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,410
What?!

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Let's see, Jesus got crucified, then He died,
then three days later, He has a resurrection,

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,800
in his fourteen Stations of the Cross, and it
says we can make costumes out of sheets.

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
- This is gonna be fun!
- I'm gonna be Jesus.

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
- You're too fat to be Jesus!
- Oh like you're gonna do it, Jew?!

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,440
Stan should be Jesus!

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,480
Either I'm Jesus or I'll screw
you guys, I'm going home!

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,040
You are such a fat baby!

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,760
Well I guess you guys can do the
Stations of the Cross by yourselves.

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,160
Alright, alright! You can be
Jesus you tubby crybaby!

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,280
Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.

98
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,720
Alright, alright, let's try it again.
Kenny was standing here.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
Stan, Kyle, and Cartman
were walking around him.

100
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay, now walk.

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,120
- Do you feel hot?
- No.

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
Dammit! How come
you're not combusting?

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Come on Randy, you said we were
gonna drink beer and watch the fight.

104
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,480
Another one!
Another one combusted!

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,520
No! She been
doing anything odd?

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,461
No! She was just on her way
to her new boyfriend's house!

107
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,243
Boyfriend? And they say
Kenny had a new girlfriend.

108
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:49,840
This is stupid. Screw
you guys, I'm going home.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
No! I think I might have it!

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Well well well! A lot
of you came to church.

111
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Looks like we're all a little nervous about
this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,520
Well, on this blessed Friday, let us
give thanks for stuff, and things...

113
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,757
Lord, is it so much to ask that
you to not let us suddenly

114
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:15,280
burst into flame for no apparent
reason, I mean, come on, Amen.

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,604
And now, some of our
darling local children

116
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,705
are going to perform
the Stations of the Cross.

117
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,800
Station 1: Jesus is
comdemmed to death by pilot.

118
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
Die!

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Ow! You can do what you
will, but I am the Lamb of God.

120
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,420
Station 2:
Jesus takes His cross.

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,840
This cross is seriously heavy.
Oh man! This is totally weak.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,320
And then, Jesus' Disciple
Peter denies he knows Him.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,520
- Peter!
- I don't know you, dude.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh Peter, weak.

125
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,480
Peter, lame. But I'm Jesus,
so I'll forgive you, I guess.

126
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:58,440
Mayor! - Mayor! I have it! I found out
why people spontaneously combust!

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,426
Why? - The answer's too
complicated to explain over the phone.

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,680
Call a town meeting tomorrow.

129
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,606
Okay. If your right
about this Marsh,

130
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,207
you're gonna be the most
popular man in South Park.

131
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Randy! Randy! Randy!

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
We love you Randy!

133
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,160
Make love to me Randy! Please!

134
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,600
Schmuck!

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,400
Station 11: Jesus
is nailed to the cross.

136
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,040
Oh, this has gone from
weak to super-weak.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,240
Things can not get
any more weak for me.

138
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,240
Then a crown of thorns was placed on
Jesus' head and Jesus was all like, thanx.

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,040
Well, this sucks
that I have to die,

140
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,320
but if I die, everyone's sins will
be forgiven, so I guess it's cool.

141
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,598
And then Jesus was lead
away to Mount Sinai,

142
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,799
where He died and has a
ressur-erection three days later.

143
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,920
Hi mom.

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,440
Thank you, boys. Blessed
be the name of Jesus.

145
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,640
It's a great name, isn't it?

146
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
Hey! That went really
well. They really liked it.

147
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
Yeah, I told I'd be a
sweet Jesus you guys.

148
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,508
Oh man! At least the real
Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds.

149
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,909
Up your ass with broken glass!

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
This spot looks good.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,960
Yeah. that looks pretty good!

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
- Okay, cool, see ya Cartman!
- Hey, wait, where the hell you going?

153
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,920
- I don't know. I'm going
home, I guess. - Yeah, me too.

154
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
Well get me down from here!

155
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,160
Cartman! How stupid are you?!
Didn't you read the Bible?

156
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,950
We have to leave you
up there until you die,

157
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,951
and then you come back to
life in three days. - What?!

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,663
- Yeah dummy, you have to get an
erection. - Then I can give it to my dad.

159
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,320
Hey! I don't wanna
be Jesus anymore!

160
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,520
Don't leave me
here! You guys!

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
Alright! That does it!

162
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,280
Screw you guys,
I'm going home!

163
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,880
Okay! I'm getting pissed now!

164
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Okay, people. Scientist Marsh and
I have been working very hard

165
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,361
on the problem of
spontaneous combustion,

166
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,080
and we have finally come
up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,057
The little boy combusted
because he had a new girlfriend.

168
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:56,007
I wasn't the girl that
caused him to combust,

169
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:59,998
it was the fact that Kenny did
not wanna pass gas in front of her.

170
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:01,904
You see, as food is digested,

171
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:05,205
the natural processes give off a
byproduct known as methane gas.

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,120
The methane gathers here in the
bowel area where it causes pressure.

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Normally a person would expel this
build-up in the form of a pleasant fart.

174
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Should the gas not be expelled
the methane can build up,

175
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
and then ignite, leading to...

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
disaster.

177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,680
Kenny combusted because he
held his farts in for too long.

178
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,200
- You mean all we have to do is
fart and we won't explode? - Exactly.

179
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,831
So from this day forward everyone in
South Park will be required to fart

180
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,680
on a regular basis to ensure that
nobody else spontaneously explodes.

181
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,720
We love you Randy!

182
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Make love to me Randy, please!

183
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,200
Whoa, dude! My dad's famous.

184
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,760
Come on. Let's go see how
Cartman's doing with his erection.

185
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
Wow, he died.

186
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Now we just gotta wait for his
erection, and I can give it to my dad.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
Hey there you guys are!

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,440
- Cartman? - You guys are in big
trouble! Now get me down from myah!

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,960
How come you're not
dead yet, Cartman?!

190
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,640
You guys, I am seriously...
Get me down right now!

191
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,774
Look fatass, after you die,
and get resurr-erected,

192
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,503
you'll have all kinds of super
powers just like Jesus. - Really?

193
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah! So hurry up and
die you piece of crap!

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,917
When I get my super
powers, I'm gonna use them

195
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:19,400
to smote you two assholes right off
the planet! Super powers is sweet.

196
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,440
- Hi boys.
- Hi Mr. Mackie.

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,744
Have you boys been sure
to pass gas regularly

198
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,345
so you don't
spontaneously combust?

199
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,600
We know how to
fart Mr. Mackie!

200
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Well let me show you,
just to be sure, mmmkay.

201
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Come on!... Good good ass...

202
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,280
- Jesus Christ!
- Sick, dude!

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,080
I had a steak wrapped
with bacon last night.

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
Dude, I could have know that.

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,240
So you boys understand you have
to do that regularly, mmmkay?

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
Okay, okay! Just go away!

207
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,000
God, that was not
cool at all, dude!

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
Oh, hello boys, have you
seen Eric around anywhere?

209
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,120
- Uh, we've been taking care of him.
- Yeah, we're having his resur-erected.

210
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,760
Oh, alright! I was just at
the store buying some apples.

211
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
- Apples?
- Yes, apples.

212
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,840
Apples, get it?

213
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Stinky apples. See ya boys.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
- I don't think I like this
new law. - Squeaker.

215
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,446
And so I declare today Randy Marsh
day, where we shall remember forever

216
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,280
how he freed us all from the
threat of spontaneous combustion.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Gentlemen?

218
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,560
You're the best, Randy!

219
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,480
I am? I am, huh! I never knew the
depth of my scientific genius until now!

220
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
It's too bad Cartman can't
be here to enjoy this.

221
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
You guys! Seriously!
Somebody get me down from myah!

222
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,120
Officer Barbrady!

223
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,600
T. T is for turtle.

224
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,160
Ay! Help me you sonofabitch.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm gonna die up here.

226
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,600
We now return to the 42nd
Annual Nobel Prize Awards.

227
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,720
Here again your host,
Whoopi Goldberg.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,960
Republicans are so stupid!

229
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,200
I hate republicans!

230
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
Republicans are so stupid!

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,440
And now here to present the Nobel
Prize for Science, here's Nick Nolte.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,800
Science is good.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,240
Science is very im-port-ant.

234
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
This years nominees are...

235
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,002
Harold R. Pinkerton for his
further development

236
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,303
of the grand unified
theory of physics.

237
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,840
Randy Marsh for his formulated break-
wind theory of spontaneous combustion.

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,200
And Alphonz Mephesto for his
seven-assed Galapagos turtle.

239
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,880
And the Nobel Prize goes to...

240
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Randy Marsh for the theory
of spontaneous fart thing.

241
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,160
No! No, this can't be!

242
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,671
I'm the best! Yeah!

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,220
It's just so amazing to be
told that you're the best!

244
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,160
I thought I was just a normal
person like all of you, but...

245
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Thank you for
showing me otherwise!

246
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,720
Yeah! I kick ass!

247
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,080
Fixed! Fixed!

248
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,840
That was supposed to be my award, Kevin!
I'll get him for this! Mark my words!

249
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,000
Wow! My dad's the best! All other
dads suck compared to my dad!

250
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,800
Hey! My dad is
pretty cool, too!

251
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm sorry honey...

252
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
It's okay. I'll just call some twenty
year old and have him come over.

253
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,040
- What?!
- I'm just kidding.

254
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,080
Kidding?! Well, that's not funny!
That hurt my feelings!

255
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
- Why?
- Why?!

256
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,840
Don't worry you guys! I'm
getting an erection as we speak!

257
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,080
Actually Cartman's getting an erection,
but then we're gonna give it to you,

258
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,680
so buck up!

259
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,200
We have a very strange
little boy, Gerald!

260
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,480
Dude, he's still not dead.

261
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
You guys, my mom is totally worried
about me, you better let me down.

262
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,240
She's not worried about you.

263
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes, she is! I've been hearing
her all day! Listen, listen.

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Eric? Eric, where are you?
I miss you very much.

265
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
That's not your mom calling!

266
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,800
Yes it is, you guys!
Now seriously!

267
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,400
This is Eric's mom and I
want him home right now.

268
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,880
How stupid do you think we are?!

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,320
Now you die on that cross and get
resur-erected before I kick your ass!

270
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,240
You guys! Now it is too
hot out myah! I can't do this!

271
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,920
He is right, it has been
getting really hot lately.

272
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,640
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's
go get some ice-cold lemonade!

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
Oh god damn it!

274
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,320
You guys! You guys wanna hear
my "I Hate Stan and Kyle Song"?

275
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,880
Nenávidím Stana a Kyla!

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
I seriously hate Stan and Kyle!

277
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,320
My God! It's burning up in here!

278
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,400
- Can't we crank the AC up some
more?! - It's already on full.

279
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
You wanted to see me, mayor?

280
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,480
Yes, Marsh, we have a new problem
and I think only you can solve it.

281
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,680
I suspect you're talking about
the dramatic heatwave.

282
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,200
The temperature is
steadily rising every day!

283
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
I want you to find out why.

284
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,200
Mayor, I think I'm a little
overqualified for this,

285
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,800
my scientific mind is best
used on global problems.

286
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Alright, alright! Name your price.

287
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Ten thousand, I have
to protect my talent.

288
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,600
Done, just find out
what's happening.

289
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,120
Don't worry, mayor.
I'll find the cause. Or else?

290
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
Or else what? Exactly.

291
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,680
You guys! Seriously now!

292
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
- Oh what now?!
- Chef! Chef!

293
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,960
- Children, what the hell are you
doing?! - Just get me down from here!

294
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,920
Oh, finally!
My arms are killing me!

295
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,280
You children shouldn't be out
crucifying yourselves out in this heat!

296
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,200
Sweet! Now I'm gonna
go kill those guys!

297
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,040
Eric, I have to tell you something,
and it's really gonna bum you out!

298
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,480
- What? - It's gonna
really piss you off!

299
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,640
This is just a dream.
You still up on that cross.

300
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
Goddamn it!

301
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Dad, where's the phone book?

302
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,880
Not now, Stanley. Without my
scientific genius the town is doomed.

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,200
Let's see now, when exactly did
the temperature start to go up?

304
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,480
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures
in South Park. Let's go to the phones.

305
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
Caller, you're on the air.

306
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,200
Jesus, after you got crucified, how long
did it take for you to die and resurrect?

307
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,960
Stan?

308
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
That's not the topic, tonight.
The topic is global warming.

309
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,640
- Do you have an opinion on
global warming? - Ah, it sucks ass.

310
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
Okay. Thank you caller.

311
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,360
Well, let's go to out first
guest, Dr. Alphonz Mephesto.

312
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,880
Thanks for coming. You claim to know the
cause for global warming in South Park.

313
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,120
I most certainly do! The
cause of global warning is...

314
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,880
Randy Marsh!

315
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,552
It was Marsh's theory on
spontaneous combustion

316
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,353
that told everyone
to fart all they want.

317
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,920
Now all the methane from all those
farts has ripped a hole in our ozone.

318
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,000
We are all doomed to die!

319
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,360
Ah crap!

320
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
We want answers!

321
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
- You killed us all!
- Someone's gotta pay!

322
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,120
Boy, they're really pissed.

323
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,764
Well they're right. We should have
known that all that methane could

324
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,920
adversely affect the atmosphere.
- Well let's go talk to them. Stick by me.

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,520
- You killed us all! - Shove
that Nobel Prize up your ass!

326
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,680
Oh my God, what's going on?

327
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,520
Now, either we hold in our farts
and spontaneously combust,

328
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
or we let our farts out
and kill our entire planet!

329
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm, for one, am
not farting anymore!

330
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,800
Uh, I'll try to find a solution...

331
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,680
We don't want
your solution, phoney!

332
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,520
Give me that!

333
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,760
Damn you, Marsh!
Get out of town!

334
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,840
You fraud!

335
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,320
- Mr. Garrison, help me!
- I do not know you, sir.

336
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,360
Up yours!

337
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,600
- Take that!
- Dude! That's my dad!

338
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
Oh yeah, sorry.

339
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,120
The spontaneous combustion
problem escalates as

340
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
more and more people go
back to holding in all their farts.

341
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
Meanwhile the ozone layer
continues to deplete as

342
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,720
others refuse to hold in their
farts for fear of combustion.

343
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,480
As we all know, the cause
for all of this is Randy Marsh,

344
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,480
the sonofabitch who
calls himself a scientist.

345
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,800
We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier
today and he had this to say:

346
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,800
I don't know what to say...

347
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
What an asshole! I hate
that guy and so do you!

348
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,840
And now on to the weather. It's fuckin
hot! Thanks to Randy Marsh, sonofabitch!

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
- Dude! Those people are pissed!
- I know! Huh!

350
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,520
- Where's your dad?
- He's hiding down in the basement.

351
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,840
I don't know what to do! - You have to
help him, just like I have to help my dad.

352
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,680
Still more effects from the heat
wave caused by Randy Marsh.

353
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,097
A giant glacier is melting
above South Park

354
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:00,498
and the entire town is doomed!
And now these messages.

355
00:18:00,522 --> 00:18:03,720
Having a hard time with male potency?
Well I don't and I'm Bob Dole.

356
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,040
What's wrong with you? Christ!
I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up!

357
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
- Are you a lawyer?
- Yes.

358
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
- We want to see
Randy Marsh. - Why?

359
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,480
- He gave us skin cancer. - Yeah!
He put that hole in the ozone,

360
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,600
and now we got skin cancer all
over our hot bodies! Look!

361
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,240
What are you doing, dad?

362
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Stanley, I think it's best you live with Kyle
from now on. His dad is better than me.

363
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,000
No he's not! He can't
even get an erection!

364
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
Really?

365
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,120
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying
dad! You've gotta come up with a solution!

366
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,600
Not me! I'm not a
scientist, I'm a hack!

367
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Even if I found a solution, those
people would still all hate me.

368
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,520
Well that doesn't matter! I learned
something from the Stations of the Cross.

369
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,280
What?

370
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,120
At first, Jesus was all like "why me?"
and he was all pissed off and stuff.

371
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,680
But then He saw what mattered
most was everybody else.

372
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,360
So He stopped thinking about His own
misery, and did what had to be done.

373
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,960
Right as Jesus was dying,
He raised His hand and said:

374
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,920
"The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few."

375
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,960
You're right, Stanley!
You're absolutely right!

376
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,200
Hey, that Bible sounds like
kind of a good book!

377
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,720
It ain't bad. You should
try reading it sometime.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
Dude, that was Star Trek again!

379
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,360
"The needs of the many outweigh the
needs of the few"? That was Wrath of Khan.

380
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:18,040
Oh well! Bible, Wrath of
Khan, what's the difference?

381
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Alright! Now,
let's get to work!

382
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,360
Dad!

383
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Dad, what are you doing?
You have to get started.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Right, right, right.

385
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
Kyle, where's your mother?!

386
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
- She's upstairs! - Well I
have something to give to her!

387
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,240
Don't worry Kyle! Everything's gonna
be okay between me and your mom!

388
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
Really! Great! I don't have
to worry about that anymore!

389
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
- Look! There he is!
- Get him!

390
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,040
Uh, please, everyone!

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,680
You're a dead man, Marsh!

392
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,200
Please, just listen to me.
I think I found the answer.

393
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Could I borrow
one of your rocks?

394
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,320
It's all about moderation.
If you never fart, you combust,

395
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
but if you always fart,
you deplete the ozone.

396
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,240
So we must fart only at appropriate
times or when it's really really funny.

397
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,360
I know you all hate me, but please,
for your own sake, fart in moderation.

398
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,600
You can keep stoning
me now if you want.

399
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,200
And so we solute Randy Marsh and his unified
theory of moderation that has saved us all!

400
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,160
- See, my dad is the coolest
after all! - Well, my dad's...

401
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,360
- Dude! Cartman!
- I forgot all about him!

402
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,120
He's been up there
for like, three weeks!

403
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,965
That's amazing!

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,480
- You guys! I am really pissed off now!
- Dude! You're still alive, Cartman!

405
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Get me down from here!

406
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,480
Dude, you survived all this time on
the fat stored up in your body?!

407
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,520
And when I get down from here, I'm
gonna kick you both right in the nuts!
