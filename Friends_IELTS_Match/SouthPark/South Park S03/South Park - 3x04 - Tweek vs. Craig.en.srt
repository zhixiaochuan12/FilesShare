1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,640
This is shop class!

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,502
My name is Mr. Adler! For the next week,
rather than your normal school work,

3
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:45,103
you will be learning
how to make things!

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,920
Now, does anybody know
why you are in shop class?!

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Because we had to choose between this and
Home Ec and we didn't want to be sissies?

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,840
Wrong! You are here,
because you are America's future!

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,920
You may someday be doctors
or lawyers or scientists!

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,040
Most of you however will be
pumping gas or cutting sheet metal!

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,520
And that's why
we have shop class!

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,880
Now, let me make
one thing crystal clear!

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,120
I don't like kids
that screw around!

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,960
You screw around in shop class,

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,080
you could loose a hand or
an arm! I have a... I have a...

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
Mr. Adler?!

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,480
I was just saying that I want to know who's
the biggest troublemaker in your class!

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,000
- Tweek is!
- No I'm not!

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,320
Yeah you are, Tweek!
You always get in trouble!

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,440
Uh, hello! Excuse me, but Craig is
the biggest troublemaker in our class!

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
That true, Craig? You
a troublemaker? - No!

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,300
Well, you better not be,
because in shop class y...

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,920
- Hey! Did you just
flip me off?! - No.

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
- Yes you did!
- Told ya!

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Dude, shop class sucks! Maybe
we should've taken home ec!

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,360
No way, dude!
Home ec is for girls!

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,280
Welcome to Home Ec!

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,960
For the next week, you will
be learning how to bake,

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,960
sew, clean, and make things
that are lacey and pretty!

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
- Yes, Wendy? - I requested to be
in shop class, but they sent me here!

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,905
That's right,
Wendy! You see,

30
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,406
some of you girls will go on to
have interesting jobs and careers,

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
but all of you pretty ones
won't have to worry about that,

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,920
because you can marry a nice man,
and that's why we have Home Ec!

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Wonder why Kenny didn't
wanna take shop class!

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know! He's such a wus!

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,560
Hey! Don't screw around!
You screw around too much!

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,320
You know, y'guys were totally wrong
about Tweek! Craig is way worse than he is!

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
No he's not,
dude! Craig is a wus!

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,080
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a
fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass!

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah, I'll bet!

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
- How much?
- Five bucks!

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
You're on!

42
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:45,560
Hey, Tweek! Dude, Craig chooses
you! He wants to fight! - He does?!

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,800
Yeah! He's all pissed off at you,
so will you fight him? - Why?!

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,440
Dude, because you have to stand up
for yourself! So will you fight him?

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,920
He doesn't look like
he wants to fight me!

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
Craig, can I talk
to you real quick?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
Eh, just a second! Jus...jus.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm not normally want to get
involved in this kind of thing, but,

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,000
well I was just standing over by Tweek and
he called you a big poop eater! - He did?!

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,324
Yes! He said you eat
poop and it makes your

51
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,925
breath smell like poop
and that... well... you like it!

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,240
- Why would he say that?!
- I don't know, Craig! I don't know!

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,320
But, now he's over there telling everybody
that you're a poop eater and he chooses you!

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
- Well, I gotta go over there and...!
- No! No, Craig!

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
Y-you can't fight him here!
Mr. Adler will just break it up!

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,291
Tell ya what! I'll go tell him
that you accept his challenge

57
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,892
and set it up for
after school instead!

58
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,682
Okay!

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
- There! You see? He just
flipped you off! - What a jerk!

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,720
- He's really got it out for you,
dude! - Why! Wha'did I do?!

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,960
- So, do you agree to fight
him after school? - I guess so!

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Super! See ya there!

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Catch me, Richard!

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
I'm so in love with you, Richard!

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I made you some cookies, Richard!

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Merry Christmas, Richard!

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,160
Oh, Richard! Say we will
be this happy forever!

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh, why?! Why?!

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
Mr. Adler! Mr. Adler!

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,720
S-stop screwing around!

71
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,080
The bell rang! Can we go?

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,240
- Whoa! Uh well, sure! Uh, class
dismissed! - C'mon, you guys!

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
This is gonna be sweet, dude!

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,440
You guys are so wrong about Tweek!
He's gonna get his ass kicked! - We'll see!

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
- Why don't we just raise our bets
to TEN dollars?! - You're on, fatass!

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Well, well, well! Look who's here! Our
little home economics friend, Kenny!

77
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,199
Hi, you guys! What's going on?

78
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,280
- How come you wanna take home ec,
Kenny?! - Yeah! That's not cool, dude!

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Bye, Kenny! See ya tomorrow!

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
Hey, what's going on?!

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
- Tweak and Craig are gonna
fight! - Really?! Cool!

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,240
It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both
went home about fifteen minutes ago!

83
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,880
What?! - Yeah! They left!
- Hell! - Those sons of bitches!

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,520
- I guess they don't wanna fight! - They
wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,320
Wha'd'ya guys want?!

86
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,378
How come you didn't show
up to the fight, Tweek?!

87
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,009
Craig and I have no
reason to fight each other!

88
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
- Well, Craig showed up!
- He did?!

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah! He was standing
there waiting for you

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,560
and he was all like: "Man! Tweek's a wus!"
and we were all like: "No he's not, Craig!"

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,229
and he was all like: "Yeah he is!
He isn't showing up!

92
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,530
He's a wus and he
has crooked teeth!".

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040
I don't have crooked teeth!

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,160
And then, Craig was all like "Tweek
is scared of me! He's a big chicken"

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,802
and he started doing an
impersonation of you being a chicken.

96
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,203
So everybody
in the world saw it!

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,560
- Everyone in the world?!
- Yeah! It was weak!

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,800
- I'm not a chicken! - Well, everyone in
the world thinks you are! See ya, Tweek!

99
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
- Wait! I'll fight!
- Tomorrow?!

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,920
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?!
You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Red Racer's on! - Craig, you can watch
Red Racer any day of the week!

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
I do watch Red Racer
every day of the week!

103
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,320
Well, that's fine! I guess you don't care
about what Tweek said about your mom!

104
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,000
Goddammit!

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,520
Oh! I guess you don't care about what
Tweek said about your guinea pig!

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,240
What?! What did he
say about Strype?!

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,480
Oh, nothing except that you stick
it up your ass before you go to bed!

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,080
That son of a
bitch! I'll kill him!

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,920
Yeah, I'd be pissed too! So maybe we
should re-schedule the fight for tomorrow!

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,320
- After Red Racer!
- After Red Racer, of course!

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
How was school today, son?

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,040
That's great!

113
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:15,320
Dad! If some kid at school wants
to fight me, what should I do?!

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Son, let me tell you a little story about
when your mother and I first met!

115
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,360
You see, a long time ago, there were a
lot of guys who were after your mother!

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
And she used to be very attractive!

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,400
It's true! I was!

118
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,034
When I started
courting your mother,

119
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:32,515
there was this big muscular
football player named Quid

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,640
who didn't take too kindly to me!
He wanted your mother all to himself!

121
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,440
And so one day, he
challenged me to a fight!

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
- Well!
- Well what, honey?

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,840
What happened?!

124
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,520
- I don't know! He moved away or
something! - Yes, I think that's right!

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,280
You guys never help me!

126
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,720
Your stories never go anywhere!
I hate it! I want out! I want out!

127
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Dad! I'm supposed to
get in a fight tomorrow!

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,620
- With who?
- Some kid! - Oh!

129
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,600
- Don't just "Oh!" him, Thomas!
- Don't just "Oh!" me!

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
I'll "Oh!" whoever I want!

131
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,800
Well, that was fun,
Pearl! Se ya later!

132
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,440
- Richard, aren't you going
to invite me in? - Why?

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,400
Well, I thought maybe you would at
least attempt to make love to me tonight!

134
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,120
I can't! I-I left the oven on!

135
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Oh, Richard! Why can't you
open your heart to me? Why?!

136
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,400
Because I can't! Oh,
I know! I have genetal warts!

137
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,040
- We'll use plastic wrap! - Nope!
Sorry! Maybe some other time!

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Swing me, Richard!
Swing me higher!

139
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,280
I wanna touch the sky, Richard!

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,520
Richard, I'm here! Just now!

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,440
Oh, Richard, it's beautiful! Yes!

142
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,280
But you have to come see
me glide tomorrow, Richard!

143
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,381
I have a surprise for you.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't worry, Richard!
I'm a pilot! It's what I do!

145
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,440
Oh, now! What am I gonna do!

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Okay! So, just to set
the records straight here,

147
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,520
the fight will be happening out
by the tetherball pole at 3:30.

148
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Tweek just weighed in
at 48 pounds, Craig at 45!

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,000
Uh, how long do you
expect the fight to last?

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,000
However long
Craig wants it to last!

151
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,480
Ma-Make no mistake! Craig has been
ready for this fight since day one!

152
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
He doesn't even
view it as a challenge!

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
He'll view it as a challenge when
he's getting his ass kicked!

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,260
Huh, did you hear that?
It sounds like diarreah

155
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,600
comming out of someone's mouth
or something! - Shut up, fatass!

156
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,520
Don't call me fat,
you son of a bitch! 

157
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,320
Wow! Tweek and Craig really hate each
other, huh! This will be a good fight.

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,360
On your first day,
look at the man's shoes!

159
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,240
Sometimes you can tell how much
money a man has just by his shoes!

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,991
When he takes
you out to dinner,

161
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,192
try to sneak a peek at his
wallet while he pays for you.

162
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,880
If he only has one
credit card, beware!

163
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,480
It means he doesn't spend a lot, and
worse yet, it could be a debit card!

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,760
If he has more than four credit
cards, that's a little fishy!

165
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,140
The perfect number of credit cards
for a man to have is two! Yes, Bebe!

166
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,685
What if we meet a guy who
wants to be a doctor or lawyer,

167
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:40,386
but is still getting his degree?

168
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,520
Dump that zero and
get yourself a hero!

169
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
He could be earning
that degree all his life

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,020
while you starve to death with two
dying babies sucking at your teats!

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,596
When I have you guys' ten bucks,

172
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,997
I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest
big-screen TV in the world!

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,840
That's more than ten
bucks, you stupid fatass!

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,360
Well, if I get ten
bucks from each of you,

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,480
that's like two thousand dollars!
- Hey! Quit screwing around back there!

176
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
You're horsing!

177
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,880
Swing me, Richard!
Swing me higher!

178
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,252
Richard, I'm here!

179
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Oh, Richard, It's beautiful! Yes!

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,120
But you have to come see me glide tomo-
rrow, Richard! I have a surprise for you.

181
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't worry, Richard! I'm a pilot!

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
It's all for you.

183
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:48,080
- Mr. Adler! MR. ADLER!
- Huh?! Uh, what!

184
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,840
Tommy stuck his face
in the belt sander!

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
The belt sander?!

186
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,320
Tommy, I told you not to screw
around with the belt sander! didn't I?! 

187
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,880
Well, go on! Go see the nurse!
She'll give you some peroxide!

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,120
What's that?!

189
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,520
Huh?! Oh, this is a woman
that I knew a long time ago!

190
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,640
What?! She died or something?!

191
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,860
What!? Hey! Go on! You're
screwing around in here!

192
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,480
Oh, boy! Here we go!

193
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,400
- What's happening?! - Tweek's
gonna fight Craig! - Oh, cool!

194
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,000
Stay pissed, Tweek! Stay Pissed!

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,240
Alright! Here we go!

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,920
Time for you to get
proven wrong, fatboy!

197
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,921
You're gonna be eating
those words, asshole!

198
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,922
No, I won't, becasue you'd
eat them first, tubby!

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,160
Well?!

200
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
Come on!

201
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah! If you're
gonna do it, do it!

202
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,920
Wha'do we do?

203
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,440
Wha'do you mean, wha'do
you do? Just fight each other!

204
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,440
- How?!
- How?!

205
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,520
- I've never been in a fight
before! - Me neither!

206
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
Aw, dude! Come on!

207
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,120
You just hit each other!
Smack each other around!

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
- Ah! Well, not like that!
- Like what, then!

209
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:52,969
Alright, alright!

210
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,320
Screw this! We have to postpone the fight
so Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight!

211
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,000
- All that build-up for nothing! - Yeah,
Christ! I could've been home by now!

212
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,440
Alright, Tweek! We'll teach you how to
fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig!

213
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
Well, I don't think that's very fair! If I
teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek!

214
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh, yeah?! Well, I'm gonna have my
Uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!

215
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Boxing's scary y'guys! I'm gonna
have Craig learn martial arts!

216
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,880
- Fine! We'll see you back
here tommorrow! - Fine!

217
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,080
Fine! That's fine!

218
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,920
Alrighty, Tweek!

219
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,920
My little nephew Stanley has asked me
to teach you the fine points of boxing!

220
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,400
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state
champion until a granade blew his arm off!

221
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
Mmmmm...I can still kick ass!

222
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,560
Now, Tweek!
Boxing is a man's sport!

223
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,280
There's nothing in the
world more man than Boxing.

224
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,520
It is man at his most man!

225
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,200
So when you spar with Ned here, just dig
deep into that most man part of you!

226
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,480
Well, enough of the
lectures! Let's get to boxing!

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,280
What'chyou got, beeatch?

228
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
Keep your guard up, Tweek!

229
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,760
C'mon, Tweek!
He's only got one arm!

230
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,120
Alright! Looks like we'll have to apply the
Offendheimer Technique for Tweek here!

231
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
Mmmm... What'chyou got, beeatch?

232
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
Punch him in the balls, Tweek!

233
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Atta boy!

234
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,000
Now, quick! Hit him
again while he's down!

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Good! Now, kick his balls!

236
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,240
There! See?! You got
him coughing up blood!

237
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,480
Now, that's boxing!

238
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,600
Your friend has brought you to
learn the ancient art of Sumo!

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You must learn
dicipline and respect!

240
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,160
In Sumo, your body must be like a
stone, and your mind like meatloaf!

241
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,520
The object is simply to push
opponent out of circle!

242
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,440
- Is opponent ready?!
- I'm ready!

243
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
God! I like this hair thing!
This is cool!

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,240
Let us begin!

245
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,720
Ready!? And begin!

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
Respect my authoritah!

247
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,360
Body like stone!
Mind like meatloaf!

248
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Oh! C'mon, you!

249
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Oh, Jesus! I can't take it!

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Fight back! Resist the ass!

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,240
- How can I resist it?! Ass so great!
- It is only an ass!

252
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,520
You must overcome
the ass with your mind!

253
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,960
This ass is not like any
I've encountered, master!

254
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,040
I win!

255
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,819
There is indeed great
power in your ass, Eric!

256
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,120
Perhaps you should concider
Sumo as a profession!

257
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,040
Hey, maybe!

258
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,160
No! No! Make it stop!

259
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:26,160
Oh, Richard! Say we'll
be this happy forever!

260
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
But you have to come see me glide tomo-
rrow, Richard! I have a surprise for you.

261
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't worry, Richard! I'm a pilot!

262
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,800
Watch me, Richard!

263
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,600
Ani jsem jí neøekl sbohem.

264
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,480
Oh, no! Now what do I do!

265
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,800
Okay! That was very good, class!
Now, let's try this one together!

266
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,520
"Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"

267
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,600
"Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"

268
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
Alright! Now, let's
try this one together!

269
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,200
"Lisa Smith's husband
just bought HER a new car!"

270
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,760
"Lisa Smith's husband
just bought HER a new car!"

271
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,000
Good! Bebe, why
don't you try this one!

272
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,640
"I think a trip to Hawaii would
really improve our sex life!"

273
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,240
"I think a trip to Hawaii would
really improve our sex life!"

274
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,200
Outstanding! Now, Kenny!

275
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
How 'bout you try?!

276
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,640
"I can't make love to you
until we get a king-size bed!"

277
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay! Kenny, could I talk to
you over here real quick?

278
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,246
Kenny, I don't quite
know how to tell you this,

279
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,647
but I'm not sure Home
Economics is right for you! - No!

280
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory,
your sewing skills are below average,

281
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,908
and frankly, I don't think
the odds of you marrying

282
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:07,009
a nice rich man in the future are
very... well... good! - They're not?!

283
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,700
No! I think you should concider
transferring to shop class! - Shop Class?!

284
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,360
Now, now! Very few students
are severely injured in shop class!

285
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,161
I DON'T WANNA GO
TO SHOP CLASS!!!

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,760
C'mon! It's time for the fight!

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,360
Fight?! Oh, no, no, no! Girls!

288
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,080
Haven't I taught you anything?!

289
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,920
Okay! The time has finally come!

290
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,720
Programs! Get your
programs here! Programs!

291
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,240
Remember, Tweek!
Punch hard, punch low!

292
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,240
This is when you gotta
get mean, Tweek!

293
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,280
Mean! Aah!

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,140
The spirit of the dragon is in your hand!
Hersherdeshurta. Hurlonghurta.

295
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
- Alright?
- Okay!

296
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,400
Now, listen to me!
Herterdeterter!

297
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,340
Alright! I'm seriously!
Herpangdepongtonqwa!

298
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,520
Y'ready, Tweek?!
Y'ready, Craig?! Let's get it on!

299
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,840
Respect my authority!

300
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
C'mon, Tweek!

301
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,440
C'mon, Craig!

302
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
To whom it may concern.

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,760
I can no longer live without her!

304
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I could not say goodbye to her, and so
now I must say goodbye to all of you!

305
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,320
For I am all out of nicotine gum!

306
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,520
Sincerely yours,

307
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,040
Richard Adler. Shop Class.

308
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
P.S. Don't screw around!

309
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,960
You all screw around too much!

310
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,520
Goodbye, cruel world!

311
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
Jesus Christ!
What was I thinking?!

312
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,480
That would've hurt like hell!

313
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,120
Kick Ass!

314
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,560
Go, Tweek! Kick his ass!

315
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,000
C'mon, Tweek! You got him!

316
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
- Whoa, Tweek! Did you
hear that?! - What?!

317
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
Craig just called you a boner!

318
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,800
We just have to keep
thowing gas in the fire!

319
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,800
Hey! This shop class?!
- What?! Who are you?!

320
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,560
"Kenny McCormic has been transferred
from Home Ec to Shop Class."

321
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,240
Well, alright! Get some safety goggles and
making a corner with the jigsaw over there!

322
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:52,440
- What the...!
- There they are!

323
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,080
Hey! What's going on?!

324
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,640
Tweek and Craig are fighting!
We're just watching!

325
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,600
- Well, why the hell don't you stop
them?! - He has ten bucks riding on it!

326
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,200
Don't screwing around!

327
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,080
Stop screwing around!

328
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,440
Hey! You're screwing
around too much!

329
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,760
- Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
- You Bastards!

330
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh, don't just stand there!
Call an ambulance!

331
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,920
You see?! You see what happens when
you screw around in shop class?!

332
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
What?! What's that, son?!

333
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,840
No! No! Please don't go! I need
you! I can't live without you!

334
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,920
Richard! You have to move
on! I want you to be happy!

335
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
But, I can't! I never
got to say goodbye!

336
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,760
Then say it now, Richard!

337
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Goodbye?

338
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,771
- There! Now do you feel better?
- No.

339
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,280
Of course, you don't! Saying
goodbye doesn't mean anything!

340
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,960
It's the time we spent together that
really matters, not how we left it!

341
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
You...You're right!
You're right!

342
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,880
Richard, this is Grandma!

343
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,480
Grandma? Hi, Gram!

344
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
You never said
goodbye to me either!

345
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,080
Hey, Richie! Remember me?!

346
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,160
Uncle Corey! Wow!
You're all alive again!

347
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,200
No, we're dead!

348
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,520
I love you, Richard!
See you soon!

349
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,640
Thank you! Thank you for freeing
me! I feel like now I can move on!

350
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,360
Baby, I feel so much better! I feel so
alive! Thank you, Baby! Thank you!

351
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,760
Dude! this is pretty
fucked up right here!

352
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Hi! We're here to visit our
good friends, Tweek and Craig!

353
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,840
Oh! Well I suppose a quick visit is okay!
Maybe you kids can cheer them up!

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
Hey, guys!
How're you feeling?

355
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Well uh, we just came by because
we had something to tell you!

356
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah! See, we got you to fight just 'cause
we wanted to see who was the toughest!

357
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,520
We made up all that stuff we said to
get you guys mad at each other!

358
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,560
Yes! You can flip us off,
Craig! We deserve that!

359
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,161
We just came came by to
apologize! We feel so bad!

360
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,160
Boy, do we ever!

361
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,648
So I guess we'll be going now!

362
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:06,349
And we'll just live with the knowledge
that you're both kinda sissies!

363
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,640
- Well, I mean, that's what was on
the news. - What was on the new?!

364
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,992
Oh! You didn't see it! Oh!

365
00:21:09,993 --> 00:21:12,993
Tweek's family was on the news
saying what a wus you are, Craig!

366
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,315
Yeah! And then Craig's family came
on and said Tweek was the wus!

367
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,916
And he punched Tweek's
Mom in the hooters!

368
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,440
- You son of a bitch!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!

369
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
- C'mon, Tweek! You got him!
- Hibosukitai! Hibosukitun! Hurishurtung!
