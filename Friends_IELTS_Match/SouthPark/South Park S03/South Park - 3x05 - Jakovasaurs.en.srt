1
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,680
Y'guys! Listen to
this song I just wrote!

2
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,480
It's called "I Hate Y'guys!".

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,229
I hate y'guys!
Y'guys are assholes!

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Especially Kenny!

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,560
I hate him the most.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,120
Okay, now!
Let's try one altogether!

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
I hate y'guys!

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,520
C'mon! Y'guys know the
words! Especially Kenny!

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,120
This is sweet being
rugged outdoorsmen!

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,600
Facing the wilderness, not
having to be home until 8:30.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Where're you goin? - I'm goin home for a
minute! I have to go to the bathroom!

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,760
- Just go behind the trees!
- I have to go number two!

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,040
So, you can poo in the wilderness!

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,960
No way, dude! What
would I wipe with!?

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,600
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're
supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,160
- What do I sit on?
- You just squat, stupid!

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Not here! Go further away!

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,160
God! I'm glad y'guys know all
these pooping outside rules!

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,720
Watch out for ground eels!

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,120
- Shut up, y'guys! I can't think!
- What do you have to think about?

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
I have to think about
planes droping bombs,

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,800
and dump trucks, and
soft serve ice cream...

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,500
- Ah! That did it!
- Sick, dude!

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Pooping outside!

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,480
Making soft serve ice cream!

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
For all my friends!
Especially Kenny!

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
Hey, Kenny! Can I
borrow one of your gloves?

28
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:02,190
Okay! No way!

29
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,280
What the...! - OOMA! KOOGA!
My God, y'guys! Come look at this!

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,040
- We don't wanna look at it,
Cartman! - Y'guys! Get over hnya!

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,680
- No way, dude!
- I'm seriously!

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,760
- Look! Over by those bushes!
- What!?

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
MESO SCARED!

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
I see it!
- C'mon! Let's kill it!

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Aw, Cartman! You're
supposed to bury it!

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,560
Look at this sword! Offered only
here on House Shopping network!

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,240
It's got a dragon on the blade!

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,900
It's got a dragon painted right on
the blade! Used by the samurai...

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Ned, how the hell could
you loose your voice box?

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
I Can't hear you, Ned!

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,520
You don't have a trachea! You
smoke too much, you had it removed!

42
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,720
And then, you drank too much and
you lost your goddam voice box, Ned!

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
Shhhut-Up-Jim-Bo!

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
Ah, Ned! Don't burp-talk!
That just sicks me out!

45
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,440
- Right this way!
- Over here!

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,120
What the hell's goin on?

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found some big
animal creature! It ran over that way!

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,560
Hold on! I'll get my shotgun!

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
Ned! Ned, c'mon!

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
- Where did it go? - It
just ran by here a second ago!

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Sounds like it ran into
the ostritch trap!

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Now, keep quiet!

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
I'm gonna turn my flashlight on.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
It may get startled, so be ready!

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Holy crow! I've never
seen anything like it!

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
That thing's funny!

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,880
- It's stupid!
- Well, let's kill it!

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,770
No! No! Don't!
- Huh? - I like it!

59
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,480
You don't like
anything, Cartman!

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,840
Well, alright!

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,200
Ned, get the mayor on
the phone, tell her that we...

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah, right! You can't talk!
Alright! Never mind! I'll do it!

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
Yeah, it was like wrestling a
Louisiana alligator, this thing!

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,160
Put up one hell of a fight!

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,480
Hello, there!

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Who's the cute baby?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,080
Who's the fuzzy, huh!
Yes, that's a cutie!

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
Mayor, we're from the
department of interior!

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Oh, yes! How are you?

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
- Fine! Just fine!
- Fine! Just fine! - Fine!

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,760
Right over here!

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
My God, McLaghnan!
Do you believe it?

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,800
- It's amazing!
- What?

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Mayor, this is a jakovasaur! A
live one has never been seen!

75
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,080
Neato!

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,720
Incredible! We know of this creature
only from remains found frozen in snow!

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,010
Do you realize what this means?! We
can use its DNA and have a chance

78
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:14,211
of bringing the entire jackovasaur
species back from extinction!

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
Wow! Cool!

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,000
Is-there-re-ward-money?

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Uh, cut it out, Ned!
That's just disgusting!

82
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,720
This one jakovasaur can mother
an entire population of the animals.

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Well, in that case, I think
we should name it...Hope!

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,360
- Hope!
- Yes! Hope!

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
I think his name is Joon-joon!

86
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,880
Hope! Why, that's a
perfectly beautiful name!

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
Now we must find
a safe place for it!

88
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll keep it at my house! - No, Garrison!
You'll just try to have sex with it!

89
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,726
What! How dare you say that!
- Garrison, you remember what

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,320
happened the wounded pigeon you
were supposed to take care of?

91
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, come on! You all know
that pigeon was a total slut!

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,600
I've got a barn it can stay in!
It ain't much, but it's heated!

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,455
- Well, that sounds fine! Just
fine! - Fine! Just fine! - Fine!

94
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,687
Now, wait a minute!
I wanna clear the air, here!

95
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:03,700
We all know that
pigeon was a whore!

96
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:10,664
Raise your hand if you didn't sleep
with that pigeon! Oh, whatever!

97
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,000
It's got a dragon painted on the
blade! This is the Sumatomi Sword...

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,440
Wow! A dragon
right on the blade!

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,320
Mom! Can I get a Sumatomi Sword
used by the ancient Togagawa soldiers?

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
- I'll think about it, hon!
- Weak!

101
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
Mom! Somebody's at the door!

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,840
- Mommy's busy, poopykins!
- Should I get it?

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,960
Go ahead, snookums! It's
probably one of your little friends!

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Okay! Okay! Hold your horses!

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,760
Mom! It's another
Stark's Pond creature!

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,440
That's nice, muffin!

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
PLEASE HELP ME!

108
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
PLEASE HELP ME
FIND JOON-JOON!

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,920
SHE HAS BEEN GONE SINCE LIST
NIGHT AND I'M WORRIED SCARED!

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,200
- You mean the other jakovasaur?
- WHAT MEANS A JAKOVASAUR?

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
You're a jakovasaur!
That's what they call you!

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,560
OH! COOL NAME!

113
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,520
But the other jakovasaur
talked different!

114
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
THAT'S 'CAUSE JOON-JOON'S A
GIRL! GIRLS TALK DIFFERENTLY!

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's call my friends over!
They're never gonna believe it!

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,440
PLEASE TAKE ME TO JOON-JOON!

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
WE'RE THE LAST OF OUR KIND!
THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US LEFT!

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,840
He's the last of his kind, y'guys!
There's only two of them left!

119
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,823
Did you smoke some
of your mom's crack?

120
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,024
Will you stop with the whole mom
smoking-crack thing?! It's an old joke!

121
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,520
ERIC! DO YOU HAVE
ANYMORE COOKIES?

122
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,200
- Who's that? One of your mom's
boyfriends? - No! That was a jakovasaur!

123
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
It's okay to come in!

124
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,280
Jakov! I want you
to meet friends!

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,320
HI, YOU GUYS!
I LOVE NEW FRIENDS!

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
- Isn't he funny?
- No, he's annoying!

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,541
What're we
supposed to with him?

128
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,342
We have to take him to that
rancher's barn to see his girlfriend!

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,881
- Why don't we just tell our parents?
- No! Adults won't understand!

130
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,882
We have to do this ourselves!

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Keep quiet! We can get in
big trouble for being here!

132
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,880
Keep quiet, stupid!

133
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
OH, JOON-JOON!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY!

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,520
- Dude! Have you ever heard of
whispering? - I AM WHISPERING!

135
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
- You're so funny, Jakov!
- I AM?!

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,160
Ok, uh Jakov, why don't you just take
boonga here and go back to Stark's Pond?

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,437
OH, I DON'T KNOW! THIS PLACE IS
KINDA NICER THAN STARK'S POND!

138
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,214

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,960
Nnngg... Blimey!

Here with more on the status of the
jakovasaurs is department of interior guy!

Thank you, Mayor! The noble
jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction!

160
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,760
And now, you as a community have
a chance to bring them back!

161
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
"Thank you, Mayor, for
this distinctive honor..."

162
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,000
- What're you doing, fatass?!
- I'm preparing my speech

163
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
for when they call me up to
congradulate on me on my discovery!

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
"Thank you, Mayor, for
this distinctive honor..."

165
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,680
Hope and Jakov are
the last of their kind.

166
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
But, with the help of the mayor, we have
implemented a plan to help them breed!

167
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
We will give them a home and
a fighting chance at survival.

168
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
Yay for Hope!
- THANK YOU!

169
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,200
And now, the little boy who first
discovered the jakovasaurs,

170
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,640
Eric Cartman!

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Thank you, Mayor, for this
honorable distinction! Ahem!

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
Well, that's about it! Let's go!

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,440
Ya know, there's really only two season
here in South Park. Winter and July.

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,840
But I'm seriously! South Park has always
been a place of discovery for me.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,560
Hey! You sons of bitches! Get back hnya!
I'm having a goddam distinctive honor!

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
WOW! IT'S SO PRETTY!

177
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,320
Well, Jakov, we hope this new
home inspires you and Hope to uh...

178
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,680
...hm you know!

179
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:44,412
WHAT?

180
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,438
Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs,
so maybe you two should uh...

181
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:50,257
WHAT?

182
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,267
...get to some business! - WHAT?

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
- THEY WANT YOU TO HAVE
SEX, GODDAMMIT! - OH!

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,960
We'll just leave you
two lovebirds alone!

185
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:06,060
ALRIGHT, THEN!

186
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:14,925
MESA JUS DOWONAH!

187
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,360
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

188
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
Jakov, to have sex,
all you need to do is...

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
well, you know... put your...

190
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,840
Hmmmm! I guess we don't know
exactly how jakovasaurs mate!

191
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
There is another option!

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,480
I've manage to artificially
inseminate Hope with your semen!

193
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
I HAVE SEAMEN?!
WHERE'S THE BOAT?!

194
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes! Yes that's
very funny, Jakov!

195
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,400
I will need to examine Hope once
more to see if the process worked!

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,480
Goddam! Shut up!

197
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,520
Yes! Yes! I think it worked!
They're going to be parents!

198
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Yeah! - We did it!

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,040
NOW I CAN BE LIKE ALL THE
OTHER DADS IN SOUTH PARK!

200
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,400
Dude, do we really want another one
of these things hangin around?

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,360
And Bobby Tister is having

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,360
a great first quarter! Let's see
what trigger he uses here!

203
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,720
Here's the snap! And he's...

204
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,480
THANKS FOR INVITING ME
TO WATCH THE GAME, GUYS!

205
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,720
No problem, Jakov!

206
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
To the fourty yard line!

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,320
GO NINERS! NIIINERS!

208
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,560
We're rooting for the
Broncos here, Jakov!

209
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,680
To Turald Davis! He's at the
fifty! The fourty! The thirty!

210
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT?!

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
THERE'S ONE TIME! I WAS
WATCHING THIS RABBIT!

212
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,240
He breaks another
tackle and the Broncos...

213
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,160
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT... HAPPENED?!
IT TOOK DOOKIE-RED-RADAPIE!

214
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,800
Hey, Jakov! Uh, could you run down to
the store and get some more pretzles?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
SURE! YOU GOT MONEY?!

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,601
Here... here you go! And...and don't
go to the store down the block!

217
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:36,502
The one four miles away in
Fairplay has better pretzles!

218
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
COOL BEAN!

219
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
WHOOPSIE! I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

220
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Jakovasaurs kinda
piss me off! Mkay?!

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,640
Amazing! The justation
period was only four days!

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,060
At that rate, we could repopulate
the jakovasaurs in just a few years!

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,260
Don't worry, Hope! Everything's gonna
be fine! Just fine! - Just fine! - Fine!

224
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
Dude, I don't wanna watch
this thing have a baby!

225
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,480
If Jakov and hope don't have kids,
their race will become extinct!

226
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,880
Maybe the baby will be
stale-born like Cartman was!

227
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
Hey! I might've been stale-born,
but at least I got better!

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Here we go!

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,840
Behold! The miracle
of child-birth!

230
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Gross!

231
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,840
This is the first step in bringing the
species back from the brink of extinction!

232
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,880
- Looks like there maybe a second one!
- That would be a great start for them!

233
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,320
She's a cannon!

234
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,680
Well, apparently
they breed in litters!

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
Aren't they cute, y'guys?

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Dude, I'm not so sure
if this is a good thing!

237
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,273
Okay, children! We have some
new students joining us today!

238
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,274
Let's all be warm and
welcome them to our class!

239
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Dude, it's crowded in here!

240
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,080
I LIKE SCHOOL!

241
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,480
Okay! So we're just gonna stick to our normal
lesson plan and start the day with histor!

242
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:02,120
Now, does anyone know why Chubby
Checker left the Beatles in 1972?

243
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,880
- Yes!
- I DON'T KNOW!

244
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Okay! Is there anybody who
can answer the question?

245
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,520
- I CAN'T!
- ME NEITHER!

246
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
Dammit! Ya don't raise
your hand if you don't know!

247
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
FIGHT! FIGHT!

248
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,120
SCHOOL! SCHOOL! I LIKE SCHOOL!

249
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,040
SCHOOL! SCHOOL! I LIKE SCHOOL!

250
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,280
This sucks ass!

251
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,120
I like going to school now!
Jakovasaurs are so cool!

252
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,040
This is insane, Mr. Garrison!
- It sure is, Mr. Hat!

253
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Now, folks,

254
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,680
I know we're all a little worried about the
jakovasaurs, and I wanna hear you all out!

255
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,160
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my
classroom! I can't teach our kids anything!

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,160
And those jakovasaurs eat three times as
much as normal children! I can't keep up!

257
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,960
And they're creating more
trash than we can handle too!

258
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,895
And what about little
Laura! The Williams' kid!

259
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,896
If she doesn't get that heart
valve operation, she could die!

260
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah! Yeah! That's right!

261
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
Alright, alright! It's obvious be have to do
something, but we can't just make them leave!

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
e just encourage them
to find some place better!

263
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,456
But where?! Jakovasaurs are
big, loud, annoying, and stupid!

264
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:09,657
Where would they fit in?

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,990
- Memphis? - Yes! Memphis! You
jakovasaurs would love it there!

266
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,240
I DON'T KNOW! I LIKE
SOUTH PARK A LOT!

267
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
WHA'DO YOU THINK, HONEY?!

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,120
But everyone in South Park wishes
they could live in Memphis! Right?

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
Yeah! I'd love to go to Memphis!

270
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,400
OKAY! WE'LL MOVE TO MEMPHIS!

271
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
Hey, Jakov! How's it going?

272
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,080
- GREAT, ERIC! WE'RE MOVING!
- Huh, moving!?

273
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,160
ME AND MY FAMILY ARE HEADING
TO THE PROMISED LAND OF MEMPHIS!

274
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,520
You can't leave!
You're my friends!

275
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
Oh, Eric dear!
It's what's best!

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Yeah! Let's get
that luggage packed!

277
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,680
Jakov! Please don't go! You
make everything in South Park fun!

278
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:48,920
You brought life to this whole
town! It would suck without you!

279
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,920
IT WOULD?!

280
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Yes! These people, Jakov!
These people need you!

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,040
I need you!
Please, Jakov! Stay!

282
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
OKAY! I LIKE SOUTH PARK
BEST OF ALL! WE'RE STAYING!

283
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,640
Hooray! Jakov
is staying, y'guys!

284
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,120
- Now what do we do? - Don't
worry! We've come up with a plan!

285
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
- You have?
- Yes! We're leaving!

286
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,845
What?!

287
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,160
We're getting the hell out of here
and away from those goddam things!

288
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,120
You can't leave!

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes! Who would
take care of them?

290
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,160
Little boy, we're making you an
Honorary Department of Interior Person,

291
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,800
so now you are officially in charge
of South Park's fish and wildlife!

292
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,801
You have authority
over all of them!

293
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
I have authoritah?!

294
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,680
That's right! And people must respect it!
- Well, that should be fine! Just fine!

295
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,280
- Fine! Just fine!
- Fine!

296
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
Aww, no! Nothing's worse
than Cartman with authoritah!

297
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,680
Bye-bye, now!

298
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,120
And now, back to
Jakovasaurs on Comedy Central!

299
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,360
HI, HONEY! I'M HOME!

300
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,160
IT WAS ROUGH AT WORK TODAY!
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH COFFEE!

301
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,520
NO! IN THE BOSS'S LIP!

302
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,640
- HELLO, DAD! - HELLO, SON!
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?!

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
OH, NOT SO GOOD! SOMETHING
REALLY STRANGE HAPPENED!

304
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,400
WHAT?! YOU MEAN MTV PLAYED
A VIDEO THAT WASN'T WILL SMITH?

305
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
NO, DAD! A MAN IN A BLUE SUIT
AND AN BAG CAME TO THE DOOR!

306
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,560
HE JUST LEFT THIS STILL PIECE
OF PAPER WITH A STAMP ON IT!

307
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,600
THAT'S CALLED A MAILMAN!
HE TAKES CARE OF MAIL!

308
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,920
OH! HE TOOK CARE OF MOM TOO!

309
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,520
YOU'RE A NUT!
LET ME SEE THAT LETTER!

310
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,080
IT'S FROM A GAMESHOW! THE
MAYOR HAS INVITED ME TO COMPETE!

311
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:32,931
Hi, Jakov!

312
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,000
What the hell is that?

313
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,080
Who's laughing?

314
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,320
THE MAYOR HAS INVITED US TO COMPETE
ON A GAMESHOW IN SOUTH PARK!

315
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,440
FIRST PRIZE IS AN ALL
EXPENSE PAID VACATION!

316
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,814
Wow! That's cool! I can
help you get ready!

317
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
C'mon! C'mon!

318
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,000
MAYOR! THIS IS JAKOV! I'M THE
TALL FELLOW DOWN THE BLOCK!

319
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,800
Yes, yes, Jakov! You're calling about the
gameshow! Congratualations! Will you do it?

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,200
SURE! IF A FREE TRIP IS INVOLVED!
CAN MY WHOLE FAMILY GO?!

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
Of course! That's the point!

322
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,240
ust be ready this afternoon
at the public access building.

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
And good luck!
Hope you win!

324
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,360
COOL! WEEE!

325
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
We got him! Alright!

326
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,200
The boys here will keep
little Eric Cartman distracted!

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,676
Meanwhile, we get rid of the
jakovasaurs and bring some

328
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,677
normalcy back to
this town! Ready?!

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,560
Ned! A package came to you
today from Voice Box Express!

330
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Oh!- Boy!- Oh!- Boy!

331
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,160
- Now remember, Barbrady! All
ya have to do is loose! - Right!

332
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,520
Okay, let's quiet down,
people and jakovasaurs!

333
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,526
Now, as you know, the winner of this
little game will get an all expense

334
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,600
paid trip for himself and fifty of his
closest relatives to lovely France!

335
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,560
And, all one of you lucky contestants has
to do is answer only one of these questions!

336
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
Are you ready, players?!

337
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
- Ready!
- READY!

338
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,880
- Okay! Hands on
your buzzers! - 47!

339
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,256
- You have to wait until I ask
the question first! - SORRY!

340
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,600
- That's okay! Hands on buzzers!
- TURKEY SANDWICH!

341
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,812
Damn! He's quick!

342
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
- OH, SORRY!
- I'm sorry!

343
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
- NO! IT'S MY FAULT!
- No! It's all me! My bad!

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
Will somebody please
unplug the goddam buzzers!

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,800
Got it!

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Now, can we get on with this?!

347
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,080
First Question,
what color is blue?

348
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,640
- Blue?
- What?!

349
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
Blue is blue?

350
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,600
AWW! DID I LOOSE?

351
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
What? Loose?
No, no! Hang on!

352
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
You're supposed to
loose, you idiot!

353
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,323
- Where am I? - Just don't
answer anymore questions! Got it?!

354
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:32,139
Okee Dokee!

355
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Sorry, folks! A little mix up!
We're playing best out of three!

356
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,040
What're we doing out here y'guys? I
wanna see if Jakov wins that gameshow!

357
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, he'll win! Don't worry!

358
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,249
We just have to show you this
new species, because you're the

359
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,760
department of interior guy, now!
Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears!

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,680
Ah! Let me get out my notepad so
I can classify this new species!

361
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,040
hat should be fine!
Just fine! Just fine! Fine!

362
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,720
There it is! That must be
of the antelope family!

363
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,240
That's Kenny with
branches on his head!

364
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,360
Why did you bring me all
the way out here, y'guys?

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South
Park suck! You have to understand that!

366
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
What does that have to do
with me being all the way out...

367
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,040
Wait a minute! You're distracting
me! That gameshow is a fix!

368
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,166
Cartman, wait!

369
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,201
Hey, guys! What about me?!

370
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,360
- What's two plus two, Jakov?
- I DON'T KNOW!

371
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
Four?

372
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,080
Jakov, what is your name?

373
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,320
Jakov.

374
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh, screw it! Jakov wins!

375
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,600
I DO?!

376
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,400
You and your entire family are going
to wonderful and exotic France!

377
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
Alright, everybody! Let's
get them to the airport!

378
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,400
Let's go people!
There's no time to loose!

379
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,640
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR CLOTHES?!
SHOULDN'T WE PACK FIRST?!

380
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,850
Jakovasaurs don't
wear clothes, Jakov!

381
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:47,800
OH, YEAH! WELL, GOODBYE EVERYBODY!
WE'LL SEND STUFF FROM FRANCE!

382
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,560
- Close the doors!
- Open this door!

383
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,880
Eric, this is for the best!

384
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
I am department of interior
guy and I have authoritah!

385
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,520
Noo! Jakov! Don't go!

386
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,320
HI, ERIC! I CAN'T FIND IT!

387
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,440
Come back!

388
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
Eric, it's important for
you to understand!

389
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,560
No, mother! Just don't!

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
I know it's hard, Eric! But
I've learned something today!

391
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,160
You see, animal species come and
go! It's all a part of natural evolution!

392
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,120
The jackovasaurs would've gone
extinct if we hadn't interfered,

393
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,880
becasue their particular form
of life simply wasn't practical!

394
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,960
We can't go around
saving every form of life

395
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,560
anymore than
we can kill them all!

396
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,840
We have to let
nature run its course!

397
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,440
Ned, that voice box sucks!

398
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,840
I know! I'm still trying
to find my old one!

399
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,480
Well then, let's say we
all go get some ice cream!

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,920
That's okay! I'll see y'guys!

401
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,440
Dude! I've never seen Cartman
care so much about something!

402
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,760
Yeah! I guess he finally found
something that's as annoying as he is!

403
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
C'MON, KIDS! LET'S
GO FIND THE PYRAMIDS!
